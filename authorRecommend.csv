wiener-dog;8;4;lennycliff123;"[ ""Wiener Dog is a movie about a dachshund as it passes through several owners, though it's less about the dog itself and more about the people, some grotesque, some pitiable, that inhabit its life."", """", ""Full of memorable characters and lines, it's the movie of the year so far for me. Highly recommended though not for the easily offended."" ]"
the-beguiled;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Visually sumptuous and beautifully understated. Sofia Coppola has directed with assured confidence her best film to date, a remake of the 1971 version starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. The screenplay quietly bristles with sexual subtext and Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning are more than equal to the demands placed upon them by so intelligent a re-imagining, where subtlety is the order of the day. One is left compelled,gripped and exhilarated. Definitely better than the original."" ]"
baby-driver;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Flashy, entertaining, but just a little bit too pleased with itself. To base a whole film around a soundtrack is almost certainly asking for trouble and inevitably Edgar Wright's idea and direction are both a lot better than his screenplay, which on more than a few occasions pushed the bounds of credibility. The cast are firing on all cylinders but the film annoyingly see-saws between good and fair throughout due to some loose writing. Strangely the music choices are often only ok, although credit must be given for them not having been over used in other films. Standout music piece is a track by 'Focus'(taken from Focus Three if I'm not mistaken)to accompany a chase sequence on foot involving 'Baby Driver' Ansel Elgort, who for once is actually good in a role. As befits a crime thriller the editing is sharp and the sound is clear. It must be said that the film definitely leaves an impression after disappearing from the screen. I just wish that the writing could have made that impression more consistent for me to appreciate the resultant movie better."" ]"
free-fire;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A little of this ludicrous 'Reservoir Dogs' wannabe goes a long way. Everything takes place in one location and although there is undeniable attention grabbing action throughout, there is also a certain repetitiveness which begins to pall around the half way point. A game cast do all they can with unoriginal dialogue and there are as many expletives flying around as bullets. The whole thing resolutely refuses to sustain viewer investment, and an air of pointlessness is unable to be dispelled despite snappily impressive editing and a manageable running time."" ]"
the-sense-of-an-ending;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Thoroughly engrossing drama based on a good story by Julian Barnes has some top class British actors giving great characterisations. Jim Broadbent shakes off his usual predictable mannerisms and is actually very good here and the story keeps you guessing right up to the poignant end. It's always good to see Charlotte Rampling on screen and the film also makes very good use of familiar London locations. A small gem of a film which is my favourite of the year so far."" ]"
dheepan;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A Story of three people, victims of war torn Sri-Lanka, adopting each other in order to escape to France only to find themselves in the midst of another kind of war. This richly detailed movie is both culturally and socially interesting, but far too slow to be anything more than moderately entertaining. The climatic orgy of violence (shades of Taxi Driver, anyone?) feels like the film’s raison d’etre and is signposted as coming very early on in the story’s proceedings. The subsequent coda also seems very pat and conventional for a film which is, at its core, presenting a world which is anything but."" ]"

i-am-michael;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Whilst most gay films are often about coming out this unusual offering is about a man who decides to go back in. This problematic premise could so easily have wound up as superficial or patronising taking on as it does an element of the nature vs nurture debate. Questions are posed as to whether sexuality is actually a choice, and despite one's individual beliefs, asks you to seriously consider your answer. Thankfully, due to a screenplay that is interestingly provocative and a performance from James Franco that beautifully walks a tightrope of believability, the film is an unqualified success. Franco plays Michael, a man rejecting his homosexuality after discovering god. Giving a complex and nuanced performance in another fascinating role choice that pushes his own boundaries, Franco is key to the film's credibility. Both the character and the story feel totally authentic which is no small feat given the material. True story or not, in less accomplished hands events played out could have come over as simply glib and contrived."", ""The film also touches on issues of faith. Religion feeds the story and one has to acknowledge that despite the good intentions that are implicit through one's faith, it is also these unbending individual beliefs that are responsible for so many of the world's problems. Whilst the film, thankfully, doesn't delve in to this arena, a rather telling ending certainly suggests that all is not what it seems for Michael and his new found vocation."" ]"
elle;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Isabelle Huppert has never been better than in this wonderfully constructed drama by Paul Verhoeven. Although positioning a rape front and centre, this is no ordinary revenge drama but a well written and directed character driven thriller that keeps you guessing as to the culprit's identity despite a few red herrings being thrown into the mix. It's fair to say that the film is about 10 minutes too long and for those paying close attention the eventual unmasking of the guilty party comes as no big surprise. Compelling and stylish film making non-the less."" ]"
fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""'Don't do anything that's predictable' states Eddie Redmayne's bizarrely named Newt Scamader, a piece of advice that the movie itself was never going to follow. And therein lies the problem with this formulaic, but not unlikeable Potter spin off. The trouble with these franchises or big blockbuster films is that they are all just constantly rehashing old story lines or ideas to the extent that one often knows before viewing exactly what will be on offer. This lack of originality began to pall ages ago for the casual viewer, but as freshness and surprises are no longer considerations maybe even the faithful fan will become bored with all the repetition."", ""Still, I'm sure the plentiful supply of Potter stalwarts will lap it up and, in fairness, it is actually a better film than some of those were. Eddie Redmayne follows up on his Oscar nominated roles in 'The Theory of Everything' and 'The Danish Girl' with a somewhat limp and inattentive performance, or maybe that's just the character he plays. Whichever, he doesn't impress. Far better is the supporting turn of Dan Fogler as prospective Baker Jacob Kowalski who gets unwittingly caught up in the world of magic and fantastic creatures. One scene involving him is actually very moving. The film cannot be faulted at all on its visual effects and Art-Direction. They often take one's breath away and are constantly eye catching. Both crafts go a long way in sustaining interest in a so-so story. Also prominently drawing attention, although not for the same reason, is the rather dark cinematography. Whilst the script's tone is intentionally sombre, dealing with wizards and magic as it does, the 3D visuals of the print under review are frequently so colourless that I had to remove my glasses on more than a few occasions in order to check that this effect was intentional. This aside, however, as franchises go you could do a lot worse than to commit to this initial instalment. As for the promised four sequels, I suppose we'll have to wait and see."" ]"
get-out;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Although suspenseful and nicely paced for the most part, this suffers from having a hurriedly staged finale and a few too many loose ends. One is left wondering just how the black victim will explain the incredible events that he has uncovered. Also the story arc involving the investigating friend lacks credibility and causes suspension of disbelief to just keep mounting. Still, the big reveal when it arrives is a good one and there is a compelling performance by Allison Williams which nurtures the interest."" ]"
king-cobra;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The tongue is not the only thing in the cheek of this entertainingly brisk and breezy look at the gay porn industry. Telling the story of the murder of a porn king at the behest of some disgruntled stars, the film is never as shocking as its subject would suggest but is always entirely watchable. Director Justin Kelly has assembled an unusual choice of actors for this specialised venture many of whom had their heyday in the 80’s and 90’s. Even with all the male flesh on display the real revelation comes in the shape of Christian Slater who is really quite surprising here, especially given his fairly conventional output of the last few years. Aside from Slater, Molly Ringwald turn up looking great.  Ditto Alicia Silverstone who seems a bit off key as the mother of up and coming porn star, very well played by Disney ingénue Garrett Clayton. The star of the show however, although not necessarily the best performance, is James Franco who acts as well as produces. He succeeds once again in further muddying the water with regards to his involvement in these types of unconventional projects."" ]"
moonlight-2016;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A beautifully written story delineating the burgeoning sexuality of Chiron from boy to man told via three different time periods. Beautifully acted by its entire cast and directed with confident restraint by Barry Jenkins. Add to this the gorgeous glow the cinematography exudes and you have a major masterpiece in a minor key. It's every bit as impressive as was 'Brokeback Mountain' eleven years ago."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""Fashion designer Tom Ford's new film is a fascinating and intricately complex film that compels from beginning to end. The somewhat shocking and bewildering opening makes way for a thrilling thriller of a screenplay that is rich in detail, hitting more than a few nails on the head with regards to the human condition. Performances of all cast members are good but generally un-showy with the possible exceptions being Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson. To give away any of the story would be to spoil the tantalising grip the film has whilst unfolding. Suffice it to say that the denouement thoroughly delivers on its tantalising promises. Indeed, the ending is great for those who like to think about what they have seen. Reflection enables one to satisfactorily pull together all the strands of this intelligent and rewarding adult drama whilst still leaving room for debate. As expected the film looks great with special mentions for the brilliant editing and beautifully atmospheric music."" ]"
the-girl-on-the-train-2016;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Like last year’s ‘Gone Girl’ this book to film adaptation is less accomplished than its original source. Whereas ‘Gone Girl’ was so reverential to the book it failed due to any lack of surprise in the narrative, The Girl on the train, although less burdened by this issue, is just not as good a story. The film lacks surprises or a distinctive style despite Emily Blunt’s impassioned performance. The screenplay is somewhat muddled in the telling (location shift to New York is the least of the movie’s problems) and some of the lead actors look so alike that further confusion ensues. Ultimately this is a big title that will be forgotten very quickly."" ]"
disorder;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A slow building drama that turns into a riveting thriller due to the unconventional way that director Alice Winocour steers well clear of conventional ‘boo’ moments, but still obtains more than a few jumps anyway. Matthias Schoenaert’s muscular and brooding presence as an ex-soldier suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome is also a huge asset. He seems to fare a lot better in movies when speaking in his native tongue. The screenplay ekes out plenty of interesting detail in the unfolding of his relationship with Diane Kruger’s bored trophy wife, who he has been assigned to protect whilst her husband is away on shady business. The ending offers up a closing moment that for a second has you questioning what you are seeing. Special appreciation must be given to the music and sound design which play a big part in communicating Schoenaert’s medical condition."" ]"
ben-hur;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Comparisons are odious as propagated by those who suffer from such comparisons, and whilst films like this attempt to remake classics from the golden years it is highly likely that the comparison drawn will be unfavourable to the pretender. The original Ben Hur was a record breaking, Oscar laden epic that employed the old school styles of acting, colour and cheesy special effects with such assured confidence that it almost defied criticism. This Ben Hur invites it, even if ultimately it is not as bad as cynical naysayers would have us believe. The original Judah, Charlton Heston, took the whole thing incredibly seriously turning in an Oscar winning performance which cemented his appeal in this type of sword and sandals pic. I’m afraid that Jack Huston’s lack of screen presence and charisma will not be doing the same for him. His Ben Hur, along with the rest of the cast actually, is one dimensional and colourless complimenting, in fact, the surprisingly drab production values. Director Timur Bekmambetov keeps the camera in close for many scenes which has the effect of dissipating any chance of an epic aura. To add to this the actors’ line delivery is often flat and unconvincing. This adds immeasurably to the amateurish feel that the production can’t seem to dispel for much of its running time. Still, two sequences work very well indeed aided no end by some wonderful camera shots, precise editing and impressive special visual effects. Firstly, the chariot race is good enough, and long enough, to stand favourable comparison to the earlier film and the galley slave scenes are also up to par in their excitement value. Not a complete disaster then, but it is another remake that is as misjudged and second rate as it is unnecessary."" ]"
sully;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A disappointing but predictably pedestrian telling of the plane that, due to an unforeseen bird strike on the aircraft, went down in New York's Hudson River. This is a big incident being told in a small time frame for the most part. Therefore, once the birds have done there damage and the plane crash lands there is nowhere much else for the film to go. Sure, we have endless 'what if' reconstructions and the inevitable investigation into the cause of the plane's downing, but this is all filler even if the recreations of the crash are well realised. The investigation by officials into Sully's actions are a bit on the ploddy side, only sparking any interest very occasionally. The scenes with Laura Linney are just impossible. The actress plays the part of the rather selfishly concerned wife in a dreary and tiresome manner. Her scenes add nothing to the drama, but add much to the film's descent into the average. Thankfully, the film is mercifully short."" ]"
bridget-joness-baby;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Renee Zellweger effortlessly reprises her wonderfully kooky character in this belated third film in the series. Although a touch over long, the movie is full of great British actors at their funny best, especially the excellent Emma Thompson. Only to be avoided by those who dislike having a good time."" ]"
florence-foster-jenkins;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The commercial response to art house and Cesar winning French hit Marguerite adds nothing to an already one note joke scenario. Both films have tried to make this true story interesting, but whilst the potential is there it just resolutely refuses to take flight on film. This version although positioned more prominently as a comedy is definitely not the laugh fest hoped for. The problem is that as soon as the singer who can’t sing a note is revealed the film just doesn’t have anywhere further to go as a comedy. Meryl Streep works valiantly in the role and is definitely the film’s saving   grace giving a broad performance that is, by turn, both sad and (occasionally) funny. Simon Helberg is also a very enjoyable as the pianist accompanying Florence who worries about his reputation even as he pockets the generous wage from his less than talented pupil. Like its French counterpart, production values are high with gorgeous Art- Direction and costumes on display. However, the inherently disappointing failure of both films leaves one questioning if we really needed either?"" ]"
summertime;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""This beautiful and subtly nuanced lesbian drama starts so promisingly that the heart races before the head in anticipation of what is to come. Unfortunately, the film relocates from its tranquil country setting to Paris circa 1971 and one starts to fear that it is going to lose its way. Here the closeted Delphine meets feminist and political activist Carol and it’s not long before the two are studying more than politics. These Parisian scenes are by far the weakest in the film and the heavy handed political diatribes and ranting by the feminist group about such topics as abortion are just annoying and alienating. An unforeseen circumstance forces Delphine back to the farm and her mother, Monique, and it isn’t long before Carol joins her there. From here on in the film becomes the one you always wanted it to be, intoxicatingly absorbing. Cecile De France (Carol), bearing an uncanny resemblance to Julia Roberts, and Izia Hegelin (Delphine) slowly get us to care and invest in these characters and as events develop we are treated to some exquisitely realised and, at times, moving scenes (Carol dancing with Delphine’s mother; The train station and the coda circa 1976 are all wonderful moments). As Monique, Delphine’s knowing and watchful mother, Noemie Lvovsky is terrific in support. The film also has some very pretty music on the soundtrack which is a very welcome antidote to the clutch of awful songs that occasionally burst forth, again mainly in the jarring Paris interlude. Due to its subject matter and frequent unashamed nudity this is not a film for everyone. However, others will be surprised by just how immersed they become in this little drama about growing up gay in a small conservative community in the 70’s. Ultimately, this is that rare unambitious film that truly resonates after the credits have rolled and is a most welcome alternative to the dross the summer season has offered thus far."" ]"
jason-bourne;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Aside from Alicia Vikander’s nicely textured performance this is the tried and not so trusted formula as before aimed squarely at audiences who prefer their movies indecipherably action packed, rather than intelligently scripted. If you want action; you got it. You want messy and frenetic editing? you got it. You want global city hopping? you got it. You want a slight, over extended and ludicrous story? you got it. You want fake tension? you got it. You want an insistently pounding score adding nothing to that fake tension? you got it. You want entertainment? Really! Well tough s*** cause you ain’t got it! Copy That!"" ]"
our-kind-of-traitor;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A watchable but unexcitingly bland spy story (no hesitation here in not using the word ‘thriller’) from the pen of John Le Carre that is a rather bloodless affair in every sense of the word. Politely, rather too politely, directed by Susanna White the film is singularly lacking in tension and follows a very predictable and unconvincing story trajectory. The actors do their best to engage the interest and a couple of scenes ignite (in one case literally) but, Tinker Tailor it isn’t!"" ]"
sausage-party;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""On paper this must have seemed like a sure fire hit. A crude and politically incorrect toon about food stuffs misguidedly dreaming of a better life outside of the super market shelves. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired and the bad taste jokes remain just that with the lack of laughs exacerbating the true offensive nature of the material, which possibly has something to offend almost everyone. There is a certain irony to be had from the fact that the film, aimed squarely at the adult market, is more juvenile in concept and writing than ‘Finding’ Dory’ or ‘Zootopia’, both of which are intelligently written, imaginative and truly funny. For most of its running time ‘Sausage Party’ flounders without inspiration in a desperately hysterical manner. A couple of gags raise a grudging smile and there is one very good sequence where the different sausages and veg discover their fates in a suburban kitchen. Other attempts at humour, however, involving a lesbian taco, a Stephen Hawking inspired bubble gum and a Middle Eastern pitta bread all fail miserably. Where the film does succeed though is in underlining the low level of humour to which the whole enterprise aspires."" ]"
cafe-society;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Woody Allen’s films are often either a hit or miss affair. Thankfully, Café Society can be considered a minor hit. In fact it is Allen’s best film since the excellent ‘Blue Jasmine’ three years ago. It can also be considered something of a surprise in many ways. Jesse Eisenberg is really rather good playing a role that Allen would have allocated to himself a couple of decades ago, and a blossoming Kristen Stewart does herself no harm at all in adding this confident performance to her cv. The screenplay is also relatively funny. It may not be an all-out laugh fest, but it certainly encourages one to wear a smile throughout the running time. Visually the film is one of Allen’s most accomplished belying what is probably a fairly modest budget. Vittorio Storaro’s cinematography must be amongst the best of the year in its field. Ditto the gorgeous production design and dazzling costumes. All in all it is definitely a more enjoyable film to watch than you would expect based on the quality of Allen’s recent output."" ]"
hell-or-high-water;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""This lean and masterfully directed screenplay is entirely without a superfluous moment. Rich in detail and brilliantly acted it is one of those rare films that resonates even more on reflection than whilst actually watching it. Ben Foster and Chris Pine convince totally as bank robbing brothers and veteran Jeff Bridges is at his very best as the retiring sheriff determined to catch the pair before he quits. Other supporting characters are deliciously written and outstandingly played by an unknown cast and the whole thing is beautifully shot with New Mexico standing in for Texas. Nick Cave contributes an outstanding score which is reminiscent at times of the Coen brothers ‘Fargo’. This is one hell of a movie that deserves the almost unanimous accolades that have been bestowed upon it."" ]"
de-palma;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""As a card carrying member of the De Palma fan club it is much appreciated to find this an absorbing and fitting tribute to the best director of all time. There are no talking heads here, only the big guy himself tossing out facts or anecdotal tidbits on all his films from A-Z. And indeed the work speaks for itself. Even a lesser De Palma was always better than the best from a journeyman director. His best work, Carrie, is my favourite film of all time, but his other greats include Phantom of the Paradise, Obsession, Dressed to Kill, Blow out and The Untouchables. Another couple of his films would also deserve this accolade – Scarface and Casualties of War. However, their distressingly unflinching content makes them far more difficult to want to revisit. De Palma himself states that most Directors do their best work in their 30’s, 40’s and 50’s and it would certainly seem to be true when assessing his filmography. His later films whilst never less than interesting are nowhere near the quality of his best work. In fact between 1990 and 2016 he has only made one outstanding movie – Carlito’s Way."", ""The 70’s was indeed a great decade for both movies and directors. Spielberg, Coppola and Scorsese were all getting their due. King of them all though was this man, comparatively under appreciated. His imaginative use of the camera, stylisation and fearless audacity are just breath taking. He certainly knows how to produce a ‘set piece’. Hitchcock should, and I’m sure would, have been flattered by his visual tributes. His many critics were arbitrarily dismissive and uncomprehending of his nods to the ‘master of suspense’. Only the legendary Pauline Kael seemed to truly champion him. De Palma can also be proud of the absolutely beautiful music scores that accompany most of his films from composers like Pino Donaggio, Bernard Herrman and Ennio Morricone."", ""Film makers Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow are to be congratulated, not only for the wealth of film clips on offer, but for allowing us to feast on the brilliance that is Brian De Palma. It is, as Films Illustrated said in their review of ‘Carrie’ in 1977, a superb treat."" ]"
the-neon-demon;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Arrogantly, but perhaps not entirely undeserved, Nicolas Winding Refn stamps his initials all over the opening credits of ‘The Neon Demon, a stylish, flawed and intermittently stunning visual experience that hypnotises even as it frustrates. Refn’s achievement is almost totally due to his precise and immaculate framing of each sequence and, indeed, each shot. Aided no end by knockout cinematography it all adds up to a fascinating watch as well as being a superb exercise in visual story telling. Admittedly as well as being enticing it is also baffling and there are more than a few longueurs (Fanning’s end of show cat walk being the most glaring example) that could have been excised along the way. Also the film has a couple of rather nasty and distasteful scenes within its framework, one of which involves a knife and the other a dead body, which will certainly alienate a few viewers. Refn’s direction is really better than the slight story deserves. Whereas ‘Drive’ employed a visual style to compliment the screenplay, ‘The Neon Demon’ demonstrates the exact reverse. It does, however, have a good and all-consuming final word about the fashion industry which does compliment most of what has gone before and is certainly not anti-climatic."", ""Technically the film is outstanding with kudos especially deserved in the area of costumes, make-up and sound. Cliff Martinez again provides yet another all-encompassing and vital score for a Refn film which contributes 100% to the overall impact"" ]"
captain-america-civil-war;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""Due to unforeseen circumstances, aided and abetted by a rainy day, I found myself once again submitting to the very dubious pleasures of Marvel. Admittedly this is a few notches up from previous efforts and, despite a patchy and inconsistent screenplay there is actually a germ of a good story being played out, albeit at monstrously excessive length. The mystery surrounding the deaths of Iron Man’s parents; the brief introduction of additional warriors and a fantastic stunt set piece involving Captain America and a helicopter are all plot points or moments that promise much. Unfortunately, pasting such highlights between endless fights and battles ensure that the story’s flow becomes a stop start affair. These action sequences are not only lengthy and unimaginatively staged, but are also loaded with the usual tiresome banter and unfunny lines which severely disjoint the passably good story and seem to have become a staple ingredient of these films. Technically the achievements are good enough, but it has to be said that the cinematography is very dark for much of the time. Also, the special effects whilst perfectly acceptable are not really showcasing anything new. Fans will, I’m sure, lap it all up. However, even as I contemplate this certainty the one question that keeps wanting to be asked is WHY?"" ]"
maggies-plan;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""The silly season is not lifted one iota by this critically lauded, but extremely overrated comedy- drama.  Comparisons can be made to a bad Woody Allen outing in so much as the film is set in New York and has a very verbose script, but similarities end there. Whereas Allen at his best employs great actors in good stories this verbiage finally adds up to nothing more than pretentious drivel. Despite a good start with early scenes promising an Art house level of sophisticated articulation, it’s not long before the eyes glaze over, the ears tune out and one is left to endure a bunch of uninteresting characters espousing little more than blah, blah, blah. All three leads are not at their best. Greta Gerwig is still Greta who? Julianne Moore continues to lose her edge in yet another downward spiral performance and even Ethan Hawke is the weakest he’s been for years. In fact, it is the supporting turn of Bill Hader that impresses most as Gerwig’s ‘say it as it is’ best friend. Ultimately the film is neither funny nor dramatic enough to make one care about any of these tiresome characters and their predicaments are totally uninvolving. As for the jolly incidental music, this is just another irritating aspect of a small and insignificantly forgettable film."" ]"
ingrid-bergman-in-her-own-words;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A fantastic in depth and insightful documentary about the three times Academy Award winning actress that offers so much more than the usual sketchy A-Z cut and paste biography usually allotted to actors lives. This wonderful warts and all tribute eschews an over indulgence of talking heads and old movie clips in favour of home video and archival film footage. Surprisingly, In fact, clips from Bergman’s movies are kept to a minimum. Her four children provide much of the insight and speak candidly, but lovingly about their career driven mother who nearly always allotted them second place to her desire to work."", ""Whilst viewing one is reminded just how statuesque and radiantly beautiful Bergman was, as in a lot of her films she wasn’t presented that way at all. Her pre-occupation with Joan of Arc is touched upon, and it’s also a real treat to see actresses as different as Sigourney Weaver and Liv Ullman appear together to supply both glowing and humorous anecdotes. Poignancy is added to the whole thing by Michael Nyman’s characteristically moving and identifiable score which, whilst it may be guilty of some manipulation, is still a perfect emotional fit for the tone and images on display."", ""Finally, credit must go to the excellent Alicia Vikander for providing the voice of Bergman in such an impressively unobtrusive manner. A documentary of outstanding quality."" ]"
marguerite;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A rather odd little film that’s kinda funny, but ultimately a very off key one note joke that is desperately over long. Inspired by the character of American soprano Florence Foster Jenkins whose singing was screechy and tunelessly awful, the film is most notable for its gorgeous design and costumes. Catherine Frot is fine, but this is not really a film eliciting much interest in the performances as it is just too ponderous. A promising start degrades into boredom and it is only when Marguerite is coached by an unwilling opera star, who is blackmailed to do so, that the film picks up to reach the heights of a decent dullness."" ]"
the-nice-guys;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""The Nice Guys is a sort of homage to the buddy movies that were a product of the seventies, something akin to ‘Freebie and the Bean’, complete with 70’s background music that almost screams ‘A Quinn Martin production’. Unfortunately, the film is not half as funny as it thinks it is and the plot is undecipherable if your attention wanders even for a moment. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling take their cue from the inflated script and their performances, whilst engaging, are seriously over indulgent. Kim Basinger pops up in a key supporting role to little effect reminding one, fleetingly, of her superior Oscar winning turn in the much better ‘L A Confidential’. Of Angourie Rice playing Gosling’s daughter the less said the better although, to be fair, she is saddled with a lot of ‘adult’ dialogue which comes over as too clever by half when eliciting from her young mouth. The film does have a few impressively amusing sight gags and as a throwaway popcorn movie it is at least watchable. However, despite the blood and violence of its muscular exterior, what we really have here is trivial."" ]"
i-saw-the-light;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""You will know the songs but, like me, you may not know that they originated from Hank Williams. This critically underrated biography of the country singer may be episodic in its presentation, but does a decent job of informing the uninitiated about its subject. Both Tom Hiddlesone and Elisabeth Olsen give good performances, although I have no idea how accurate they are in depicting the real people. Production values are ok, but the cinematography, whilst possibly aiming for a particular period look, is depressingly desaturated of much colour. Still, Hiddlestone has a credible voice and the scenes at the Grand Ole Opry are shot to good advantage. Overall an entertaining effort, but it is still a fair way behind the best Country music biography thus far filmed – ‘Coal miner’s Daughter’."" ]"
green-room;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The credible and the incredible meet to baffling effect in this strangely confused and confusing thriller. Ambiguous plot points and unexplained story elements leave one cold and, for a short film, it sure does out stay its welcome. Even the gore and horror moments are inconsistent and the visual effects make-up looks too unconvincingly rubbery to truly shock. The fact that someone with the type of hand injury as demonstrated here could go from victim to avenging vigilante is demonstrative of just how ludicrous aspects of the story are, and that’s before we start dissecting the paint ball theory. The familiar face of Patrick Stewart further distances credibility. His part called for someone of anonymity in the role and, whilst he is perfectly acceptable, you can’t help but think that it’s Patrick Stewart from the enterprise. The film also fails to thrill as it should and only comes to life momentarily when the victims start to fight back. Even then cast members disappear with a cough and a spit, gorily, but with none of the fanfare of tension that usually prolongs such situations in the best thriller/horror movies. Green Room may have one foot in the real world, but the other is definitely in the realms of fantasy."" ]"
eye-in-the-sky;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Drone warfare and the dilemma of various politicians and military personnel over whether or not to carry out a ‘capture or kill’ operation is the subject of this riveting spring coiled drama. When the targets they are monitoring in a house in a small Nairobi village become an immediate threat to many lives, the debate over the life of one child becomes the focus of the film. The various officials dodge responsibility or ‘pass the buck’ not wishing to be culpable should the collateral damage end up falling at their door. Where the film succeeds so brilliantly is in the writing which offers a balanced presentation of a difficult situation. Political, military and moral considerations weigh in and all facets of human emotion are never far from the surface as depicted by a fine ensemble cast. Even the propaganda machine is assessed. That the film is nail bitingly tense has to be seen to be believed as director Gavin Hood contains the action in a few rooms trusting that his use of close ups on the actors faces will complete the turn of the screw, with just a little help from some judicious editing. Helen Mirren is in her element here. She is always at her best when portraying strong women in control, and her Colonel Katharine Powell can certainly be counted amongst those. In his last screen appearance Alan Rickman has one of the film’s best lines. Rebuking a colleague’s judgemental comments his ‘Never tell a military man the cost of war’ reply, is powerfully delivered. Also, his need to get the right doll for his daughter underlines the pointless trivialities that we all enjoy whilst, generally, remaining detached from the life and death game called war."" ]"
the-wave;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""It is uncharacteristically rare for the disaster genre to be chosen as the main topic for a foreign language film, but it is to the credit of the Wave that the result still oozes all the style and class that the best foreign language films have. The film takes a formulaic scenario, a mountain slide that threatens to cause a tsunami in the Norwegian fjords, but is engagingly played from the get go. Director Roar Uthaug keeps the pace energetic and with the help of some really snappy editing keeps the tension building right through to the somewhat conventional ending. The film is strong in the areas of sound and music and the wave special effects are stunningly realised. Following the Tsunami the cinematography also comes into its own including some tense underwater sequences."" ]"
hail-caesar!;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The most disappointing thing about ‘Hail Caesar!’ is that it had the potential to be a very funny pastiche of Hollywood’s golden age, and indeed the moments involving movie making recreations are sublime indeed. The problem is that the two main threads of the story are just not worthy of the incidental pleasures that the rest of the movie affords. The characters of Eddie Mannix and Baird Whitlock, played by Josh Brolin and George Clooney as a troubled studio head and kidnapped star respectively, are just not given the material to make their characters anything but dull, despite their perfectly respectable efforts. The film is basically too loosely written to gel properly into a satisfactory whole and it is definitely not as funny as it should be. Inspired moments peppered throughout enable a game supporting cast to try and salvage a film that is resolutely skewered to following the boring story arcs of Brolin and Clooney. Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes all register strongly, but it is Channing Tatum and Alden Ehrenreich who steal the show. Tatum is dazzlingly fabulous in his big song and dance number demonstrating a talent I don’t think anyone could have imagined. And as Hobie Doyle, the dumb star of countless westerns making his transition to drama, Ehrenrich presents us with the most enjoyable and fully rounded character in the film. More of him and less of Brolin and Clooney would have been advantageous and most welcome. The film’s biggest laugh out loud moment, though, is reserved for Frances McDormand’s editor, C C Calhoun, whose one scene unwittingly, but deliciously, brings to mind Isadora Duncan. The film is finely crafted in all areas but especially in costume and production design. Their contributions add to the scenes recreating the movie making process which are undoubtedly the highlights of an otherwise very uneven film."" ]"
45-years;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A small low key drama that is big on impact as it rewards patient attention. The unfolding story takes place over the period of a week when Geoff (Tom Courtenay) and Kate (Charlotte Rampling) are about to hold a party to celebrate their 45 years together. The film slowly involves you in the couple’s relationship which is currently undergoing a testing time due to the arrival of a letter informing Geoff that a frozen body has been discovered in the Swiss Alps. This, believed to be that of his ex- girlfriend killed in a mountaineering accident just before he met Kate, unleashes all kinds of emotional turmoil, especially for Kate, and predictably ramifications ensue."", ""If the story is slight, although commendably very well written, the playing of the two leads is anything but. Tom Courtenay is good as Geoff but his role has to be considered a supporting one when compared to Charlotte Rampling. As Kate, she is at her superb best. In a hypnotically mesmerising turn, arguably her greatest, she displays all the inner turmoil through facial nuances and gestures. She is an absolute knockout here and this is yet another of her latter day performances that shows how maturity and age has really seen her come into her own. She is a fantastically underrated performer. Most actresses never enjoy the success that she has in her 50’s and 60’s. She is that rare example that defies the old adage that there are no good roles for women over 50. Well, her parts just keep getting better and better, as does she. Long gone are those indifferent roles in films like ‘Asylum’ and ‘Caravan to Vaccares’, enjoyable though they were. Director Andrew Haigh employs a similar technique to the one used in his excellent gay drama ‘Weekend’ and his location work in Norfolk is wonderfully refreshing. Most importantly though, having faith in his leading lady he unobtrusively lets Rampling carry the film. This she does with consummate ease."" ]"
10-cloverfield-lane;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Tenuously connected to 2008’s ‘Cloverfield’ but very much its own film, this is a superbly acted thriller which is edge of the seat stuff. A lot of the drama takes place in a bunker that is sheltering three people from an unknown outside terror which, according to the viewpoint of one of the three- Michelle, may not exist. The actors are great and the claustrophobic feel in the bunker is well utilised enabling the suspense and tension to build effectively. In fact, so good are the scenes within the bunker at questioning the motives of John Goodman's character that one almost forgets to consider whether the terror they are hiding from is real or not. Only when the action moves outside does one immediately guess what the truth of the situation is. The score and the terrific sound effectively jangle the nerves throughout contributing to a very impressive feature film debut by director Dan Trachtenberg. The ending leaves some room for a sequel which, in the event, could be as different from this film as this one is from ‘Cloverfield’."" ]"
a-war;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A War is a film of two halves. Both of them good, but it is in the second half when one is drawn into the drama in a more compelling way. Starting in Afghanistan the story revolves around a company of soldiers, led by Claus Pedersen (Pilou Asbaek), who are stationed in an area prone to attacks by the Taliban. During one such incident Pedersen makes a judgement call which result in the deaths of 11 local civilians. He is subsequently taken back to his home country, Denmark, to face trial for what constitutes a war crime. Although familiar from the many other similarly themed films about the conflict, A War is directed with enough verve and skill to make the story seem fresh and interesting. Likewise the court trial, another oft used setting, is actually very compelling and the actors all bring nuances to bear which provides a palpable tension to proceedings. With a few surprises and generally well written characters the arc of the screenplay ultimately impresses, even when dealing with the usually dull scenes of domesticity. Pilou Asbaek is excellent as the commander under scrutiny for trying to do his job under difficult circumstances. It is to the credit of the writing that the trial forces the viewer to ponder the moral and ethical considerations of Pedersen’s actions. In supporting roles Soren Malling as the defence attorney brings his usual strong presence to a small role and Charlotte Munck is very impressive as the lawyer for the prosecution. A War is a small scale film, very well told, about a big subject."" ]"

Critics have been running out of superlatives for this curiosity which whilst it doesn’t bore one, it doesn’t wow either. One watches in a kind of fascinated indifference.

the-finest-hours;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""The shattering of expectation can sometimes shake one out of one’s complacency, especially if that expectation is low. ‘The Finest Hours’ is one such example. Unenthusiastically reviewed by the majority of critics, it turns out to be a finely mounted and gripping disaster drama. Set during a particularly ferocious storm it tells of the rescue mission of a four man crew to reach a stricken oil tanker cut in half by the adverse weather conditions. Whilst the screenplay itself is merely serviceable it does tell a basically good true story, and the production is elevated by a high standard of performance in both the acting and the craft on display. As the hesitant captain of the rescue boat who has thus far never gained the respect of his colleagues, Chris Pine is extremely good. As his girlfriend Holliday Grainger adds a feistiness to her perfunctory role that at least ensures the film is still interesting on land, even if it is the scenes at sea that offer the most excitement. Although underused, Casey Affleck is subtly impressive as the reflective chief engineer aboard the tanker who takes command more by default than design. The film demonstrates an astonishingly good period feel and the visuals in both cinematography and special effects are momentously impressive. Music, editing and sound all contribute to the prestige look and feel of the movie. The biggest compliment that can be paid to the 3D format, and indeed the film itself, is that it is never obtrusive and just becomes part of the engrossing nature of the adventure. This must be an early candidate for the most underrated film of the year as it is both emotionally stirring and spiritually uplifting."" ]"
pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""At first instance one is dismissive of such an unlikely premise of mixing the high literature of Jane Austen with the Z grade antics of zombie land. However, whist not a total success there is definitely much here to commend a film that is at least lively and entertaining. True, the film is happiest when pursuing Austen and ignoring Seth Grahame Smith’s liberty taking best seller, but the film succeeds a lot better than one could imagine. The attractive cast are easy on the eye and the film has a surprisingly up market feel to it, aided no end by some lovely music, costumes and production Design. On the negative side the fight scenes are less engaging than they should be and on occasion down right daft. The Zombies seem to be like puppets on a string attacking the ‘normal’ cast on cue, but ignoring them when the scene so requires. The denouement to the fight scene between Darcy and Wickham is signposted a mile off. Another between Darcy and Elizabeth that comically promises sexual suggestion, a la 1963’s food scene in ‘Tom Jones’, is sadly never realised to its full delicious potential. The visual effects and Zombie make ups are variable in quality. Whilst shots of London and St Paul’s burning are very impressive, the demolition of the bridge fares less well. In a supporting turn Matt Smith scores heavily in the laughs department as the less than tactful Pastor Collins. Overall for mild divertissement it all fits the bill very nicely."" ]"
a-royal-night-out;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A lot better than the tacky misconceived premise promised by the trailer, this is actually quite an accomplished entertainment. The unlikely scenario set on V E day in 1945 has the two princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, enjoying an unsolicited night in the West End. The screenplay is actually quite credibly conceived and executed with a fair amount of humour which is accentuated by the playing of the cast. Sarah Gadon and Bel Powley, as Elizabeth and Margaret respectively, are delightfully convincing and really rather good. Rupert Everett and Emily Watson are also equal to the task of portraying George V and the Queen mother, the girls’ concerned parents. Sporting plummy accents the two effortlessly up the film’s pedigree and humour quotient. Production values are surprisingly high. Buckingham Palace truly looks like the real location from my memories of a visit there and the costumes, make-up, and choice of music representing the period are all outstanding. The cinematography, which mainly takes place at night, is luminous and director Julian Jarrold’s imaginative choice of camera angles elevates the drama from the TV movie look it could otherwise have had. All in all this can be considered a surprising success."" ]"
son-of-saul;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Son of Saul is one of those important films that comes so steeped in the injustices and horrors of its history that one feels positively guilty about saying anything negative about it. This unique perspective on the holocaust atrocities has us following Saul, a Hungarian Jew, working as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz/Birkenau. Here his daily work is to herd hundreds of his fellow race naked into the gas chambers and subsequently remove the bodies, effecting a clean-up of all traces of the horror. After one such routine a young boy is discovered, barely alive, having survived the gas. From this point in, although the boy subsequently dies, Saul becomes obsessed by having him properly buried by a Rabbi. The ambiguity surrounding whether or not the boy is actually Saul’s son casts the actions of the protagonist in a contrasting light, depending on viewer interpretation. It is precisely this unanswered question that causes confusion in the narrative which, in turn, has an overall detrimental impact."", ""The film’s style further distances. Told from Saul’s viewpoint almost totally, one watches intently but real emotional involvement is kept at bay. Long tracking shots, out of focus imagery and an in your face claustrophobic feel becomes somewhat overwhelming. Likewise, the frenetic and dizzying camera movements don’t always allow time to process exactly what is happening. I’m sure this is intentional and in keeping with the chaotic context but, as cinema it is frustratingly unsatisfying."", ""There are two standout sequences, however. The first, where Saul finds himself stripped naked awaiting execution and the second involves an escape."", ""Overall the film cries out to be seen (the critics seem to have been inventing superlatives for it). I just wish that I liked it as much as I appreciate it."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-2;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A fitting conclusion to what has been a very accomplished series. Dark in both look and tone, this entry offers up a few surprises for those who haven’t read the books. Top lined by the current ‘it’ girl, Jennifer Lawrence, who is so good in the role of Katniss Everdeen that it is nigh on impossible to imagine another actress in the part. It has to be said that performances of this stature are not usually on evidence in these kind of commercial blockbusters. It is to her credit that the films have succeeded in no small measure due to her commitment to them."", ""Having said that the film does start with a whimper rather than a bang. However, as soon as our vengeful troop head for the capitol, and specifically the Mansion of Coriolanus Snow, the bangs start in earnest and we find ourselves tensely partaking in the 76th Hunger Games. There is one gob smacking set piece involving a sea of black oil and another nail biting, beautifully photographed episode, down in the sewers where the group come under attack from mutants."", ""Ongoing delights include excellent production design and James Newton Howard’s lovely score. Costumes are toned down from the amazingly wacky designs of earlier instalments and it is left to Elizabeth Banks (this year’s clothes horse for eye catching garb. See her in ‘Love and Mercy’) to carry the day in this area. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman appears too little effect, but no doubt judicious cutting has had to play a part."", ""The film does rather outstays its welcome by tacking on a couple of unnecessary codas that add absolutely nothing. Overall, though, the series has maintained a strong emotional hold throughout. This in itself is quite rare in many franchises being made today, and the movie should be applauded for that alone."" ]"
brooklyn;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""Whilst seeming epic in scope, Brooklyn is actually a rather gentle triangular love story. It deals with a young girl’s emigration from Ireland to New York in order to find a better life for herself circa 1950’s. Soairse Ronan plays the young girl beautifully using her lovely expressionless face to hide all her inner turmoil. It is an amazingly assured and understated performance made all the more impressive by the fact that she is on screen almost constantly. The film itself is like a breath of fresh air. They certainly don’t make them like this anymore but, actually, did they ever? At first glance one isn’t prepared for the astoundingly beautiful look of the film. Instead of the dark and dingy cinematography expected we are treated to brightly lush imagery, and gorgeous costumes in which all the primary colours stand out to stunning effect. The supporting cast add further dimension with great turns from Julie Walters, Brid Brennan and Domnhall Gleeson. Standing out, though, is Emory Cohen as the Italian suitor who pursues her. His exuberance and passion are palpably felt and his scenes with Ronan are hypnotic."", ""This is a movie without a single second of unnecessary imagery or dialogue. As perfect as a film can be. Not only is it the best of the year so far, it is also the most surprising."" ]"

Unhappily married to Harge (Kyle Chandler) she suddenly finds herself attracted to (and then involved with) a much younger shop girl, Therese, exquisitely played by Rooney Mara. Both actresses hold centre stage for two hours and mesmerise throughout. Mara has never been better and understates to perfection, whilst Blanchett once again surpasses her own indelible standards with her aura, elegance and class. She is without equal at the moment, undoubtedly the best actress currently working in films. If she doesn’t nab a third Academy Award for this dream of a performance then the Oscars should finally call it a day."", ""Credit for this gem must also be given to Todd Haynes whose direction is a master class in precision and restraint. He has an uncanny knack for knowing how to get the most from every moment in every scene, and he has an amazing eye for detail. He is complimented in this by the superb screenplay by Phyllis Nagy. Her outstanding writing is full of subtlety and context. To this the actors bring the added nuances that enables them to completely realise these thrillingly flesh and blood characters. Between them they pull off an ending that is cinema heaven, as unexpected as it is wanted. An ending that hits all the right notes to perfection."", ""Past collaborators also bring their skills. Ed Lachman’s cinematography has a deliberately more subdued and grainy look than his lush work on ‘Far From Heaven’, and the colour palette is also far less vibrant. However, it is all in keeping with the period and the unfolding drama. Sandy Powell’s costumes are again gorgeous and her dressing of Mara contributes to the feeling that one is watching a young Audrey Hepburn. Carter Burwell riffs Elmer Bernstein’s astonishingly beautiful score from the earlier film, but his music is lovely in its own right. All other production values are of the highest order, as are the supporting performances of Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson."", ""A fitting and complimentary companion piece to ‘Far From Heaven’, and like that one this is a sublime film. One to see again and again."" ]"
the-hateful-eight;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""The opening credits of ‘The Hateful Eight’ rather egotistically state that this is the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino. Presented in 70mm and complete with an overture and intermission, this can be seen as either a vanity undertaking by its director or as a passion project by someone who loves cinema and the old traditions it stood for. The story outline is a mere strand and it is overblown to epic proportions (a staggering 187 minutes) that it cannot possibly hope to sustain. Things start promisingly enough with Kurt Russell’s bounty hunter escorting Jennifer Jason Leigh’s Daisy, by stagecoach in a raging blizzard, to her date with destiny on the gallows. En-route they meet up with Samuel L Jackson and Walton Goggins before holing up with the rest of the titular number in a cabin which is the home of ‘Minnie’s Haberdashery’. The torturous corkscrewing of the plot plays out from here, but interest is lost after a while due to the overly talky first half. The intermission when it comes is almost a relief. Things pick up considerably after the break and the screenplay introduces flashbacks, narration and a plot twist that livens things up no end. These devices are, in fact, Tarantino’s forte. This second half also lets rip in the blood letting department and anyone who has seen a Tarantino film before will know exactly what to expect. The cast have a lot of fun, with the best performances coming from Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and, especially, an unknown Walton Goggins. The film is technically proficient, although when the actors are competing with both Ennio Morricone’s forceful score and the sound effects of the raging blizzard, much dialogue is lost as a result. The 70 mm presentation is stunning and Robert Richardson’s cinematography of both interiors and exteriors is ravishingly beautiful. It may not be vintage Tarantino, but despite the flaws it somehow manages to stay with you long after you have left the cinema."" ]"
youth;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""This is an offbeat and charming film that resonates due to skillful writing and beautifully sensitive performances from an eclectically inspired cast. Directed with restraint the film is basically, and simply, an observational slice of life set in a Swiss spa where the characters converge and converse to compelling effect. It’s a true original with a possible career best turn from Michael Caine and great support from Rachel Weisz and Harvey Keitel. Only Jane Fonda disappoints, but that’s probably because all the hype surrounding her one scene leads to the inevitable result of expectations being placed too high. The film also has a wonderful Swiss location and great music that is emotively integrated."" ]"
secret-in-their-eyes;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Arriving almost un-noticed under the radar despite starring two high profile actresses, this is actually a very impressive remake of the 2009 Argentinian Oscar winner of the same title. Well written, and a great story to boot, the film is also smartly directed and edited, dealing as it does with two different time frames. People have criticised it for being confusing in this regard, but I had no trouble whatsoever in distinguishing which period was which on screen. The performances add gravitas. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solidly understated as the police investigator returning to his office 13 years later with new evidence about a rape and murder that was never prosecuted. Nicole Kidman isn’t bad either, although the least impressive of the three leads, as the district attorney he shares this new information with. The romantic bond implied between these two is definitely the story’s weakest link. The film’s biggest asset and the real news is that Julia Roberts, once again, proves herself to be more than capable of wowing in something other than a mediocre romantic comedy. Like her great turn in ‘August: Osage County’ she really does impress. Her performances are becoming subtler and more compelling as she matures. The vanity is gone and she doesn’t seem to care how she looks in the process of being true to the character. On the technical side the cinematography is a bit underwhelming, although the music underscores effectively."" ]"

It helps that the screenplay is sporadically funny even if impetus is lost by the end due to over length. The ability of the average viewer, however, to decipher all the plot points and jargon relating to the financial industry is almost guaranteed to restrict its audience.  Of the actors, Steve Carell comes of best and totally redeems himself after his dreadful turn in ‘Freeheld’. Technically the film lacks clear visuals on occasion, but the kaleidoscopic editing style impressively reflects popular culture of the time."" ]"
freeheld;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""Freeheld suffers from a severe belief in its own self- importance. It is one thing to champion a worthy cause, but quite another to make it vital, interesting and entertaining. The screenplay is so intent on making points about gay issues that the over statement causes the film to lose its rhythm. Ultimately it lacks bite and just doesn’t feel cinematic."", ""The performances of Julianne Moore and Ellen Page as the gay couple fighting for their due rights, after Moore develops cancer, are not always convincing. Early scenes of the two becoming acquainted are uncomfortably embarrassing and director Peter Sollett adds to this by including a corny montage showing the two women laughing, dancing and kissing. This device is just a lazy and uninspired way of moving the story forward."", ""Julianne Moore, who is almost the Queen of the controversial or cutting edge subject matter, is seemingly becoming more conventional on the evidence here. After her admittedly superior turn in ‘Still Alice’ she is in grave danger of becoming associated with TV style disease of the week movies. Whilst she does have two or three scenes that are undeniably moving there is a cloying manipulative feel to the emotion evoked. In the latter stages she almost disappears from proceedings only to be wheeled on (literally) at climatic moments with head shaved looking like a large hairless baby. That this evokes laughter rather than sympathy is entirely due to the phony and simplistic writing on display. Ellen Page has a lot less to do and her performance is just vanilla."", ""As for Steve Carell playing a gay activist, this has to be one of the worst most mis-judged performances in a serious movie for years. The performance is both broad and irritating and, contrary to audience reaction where it screened in Toronto, there is absolutely nothing funny in his playing of the way over the top character. He may be having fun but we definitely aren’t. It’s just a peculiar and jarring characterisation."", ""With all these disappointing, ineffective and just plain bad performances on view it is pleasing to report that at least Josh Charles and Michael Shannon deliver. Shannon, in particular, although still having to be a mouthpiece for obvious plot points and (over)statements at least injects some warmth into the worthiness of it all."", ""In the final analysis it’s rather telling when one highlights the end titles song as being the best thing in the film."" ]"
the-new-girlfriend;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Francois Ozon’s best film in years is a delightful and funny comedy drama that plays provocatively with gender. Romain Duris is very engaging as a recently widowed man with a penchant for dressing up as a woman. Following his wife’s death his fetish is accidentally discovered by his late wife’s best friend. Reluctantly, at first, she indulges him and it’s not long before the two are stepping out on shopping trips together, with Duris adopting the name of Virginia for his female self. This simple premise is ripe with potential. Duris, it must be said, makes a rather attractive woman and the story is hugely engaging with some deliciously lip smacking moments that are laugh out loud funny. Accompanied by another perfectly fitting score in an Ozon film, it can also boast an ending that is as surprising as it is great. A real feel good treat."" ]"
truth-2015;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Recalling the more impressive political thrillers of the 70’s, ‘Truth’ will probably fare better with American audiences than others elsewhere. It depicts the fall of several journalistic figures circa 2004 due to a hot potato of a story that aired on the TV programme 60 minutes. Being unfamiliar with the politics and the period concerned, the story comes over as almost insignificant when compared to the career damage its telling inflicted on several individuals, including the show’s producer Mary Mapes and anchor Dan Rather. The screenplay, based on Mapes’ book ‘Truth and Duty’, requires constant concentration and things start slowly. However, as the story breaks and the team responsible find themselves under scrutiny and attack, one becomes more invested in where events are heading. As Mary Mapes, Cate Blanchett offers up another indelible characterisation tapping into new areas of performance. Co-star Robert Redford, however, doesn’t exactly stretch himself as Rather. Of the supporting cast Topher Grace comes off best and he has a really rousing scene in the film’s final act. The score is great and ever present and if the film is not as memorable as past triumphs like ‘All the President’s Men’, ‘Three Days of the Condor’ or ‘The Parallax View’, it has to be remembered that they were positioned more as thrillers. This is a kind of cautionary drama from a different (supposedly more enlightened) era completely."" ]"

This is stultifying and monotonous drama from the pen of Abbi Morgan whose achievements are lessening with every film written. Whilst the subject is undoubtedly an important one it is told in such an unsubtle and plodding manner that one couldn't care less. The production design demonstrates an appropriately dark and bleak existence lived by the women working in the sweatshop. The costumes also perfectly capture the period. However, good production values can only assist a film so far. Even the performances are uneven. Carey Mulligan battles vainly with the material but her impact is less than expected, although a scene with her son does leave one in danger of shedding a tear. Anne Marie Duff is overly passionate. Meryl Streep is hokey and Helena Bonham Carter is,well, Helena Bonham Carter! The film is flatly directed without nuance and the only surprise to be taken away from proceedings is thrown up at the end titles. Here we are shown a list of the year in which different countries gave women the right to vote. Switzerland's late listing is,for a European country, as surprising as it is shameful."" ]"

Therefore, it comes as a bit of a surprise to find that it is actually quite a serious little drama. The story concerns a man (Ben Kingsley) and a woman (Patricia Clarkson) from very different cultures who, in the course of their time together as driving instructor and student, are able to embrace qualities from each other that have hitherto been lacking in their lives. It is a slight and insubstantial film, but there is sufficient originality and quirkiness in both writing and acting to appreciate its existence. It’s also great to see Patricia Clarkson in a rare leading role and she and Kingsley work well together. If ultimately the film falls short due to its limited ambition, it at least deserves recognition for attempting something different, albeit in a minor key."" ]"

What starts out as promising, if somewhat superficial slice of life, begins to fall apart in the last 20 minutes as the repercussions of Minnie’s sexual shenanigans ensures fall out for all the main characters. Taking place in San Francisco circa 1976 the story is centred on a 15 year old teenager, Minnie, embarking on various sexual adventures that lead her on the path to womanhood. Performances are really good with special mention to Kristen Wiig who makes much of her few scenes as the less than perfect mother. As Minnie, Bel Powley (often topless) is convincing as the not particularly attractive teen craving attention which ultimately jolts her into adulthood. Alexander Skarsgaard, also her mother’s boyfriend, is very likeable as the object of her attentions, even though his actions demonstrate weakness and are in reality contemptible to say the least. The film is definitely different, with a reasonable script which possesses more than a few moments that amuse. Sadly, however, the movie just doesn’t deliver on one’s expectation."" ]"
spotlight;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Slow, surprisingly muted and almost overwhelmingly disappointing. This year’s Oscar front runner for best picture deals with The Boston Globe newspaper’s expose of the dirty dealings and hypocrisies of the Catholic Church. More specifically it hones in on the sexual molestation of young boys by Catholic priests. However, despite this controversial hot potato of a subject the film seriously lacks any raw power or urgency. Instead it is content to have its leading investigators amble from meeting to meeting obtaining information rather too easily. Things aren’t helped by the lack of an emotional hook. The victims interviewed are all adults and come across as basic stock characters shouldering all the worst lines of dialogue like ‘Who can say no to god’. Lines like this are so phony that one winces with embarrassment. Anyone who has seen ‘All the President’s Men’ or Netflix’s current ‘Making a Murderer’ will know that films exposing evil or corruption can be nerve jinglingly tense and emotively powerful, but Mark Ruffalo’s annoying depiction of righteous anger just doesn’t cut it. Where the film does succeed is in keeping viewer interest in a subplot as to who in Spotlight’s department was responsible, and therefore complicit, in burying the story years earlier. Performance wise the Oscar nominated turns of both Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams seem quite conventional and uninteresting, whereas the actors in smaller parts; Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and John Slattery all fare much better. The ‘Spotlight’, however, does shine on one person; Michael Keaton. For an actor who is often guilty of being way over the top he is here at his most understated. It is more than fair to say that he single handedly elevates ‘Spotlight’ to a level way above the mediocrity of the rest of the film."" ]"

Based on a true story about one particular expedition that, due to appalling weather conditions, resulted in the loss of lives and the shattering of others. From the beginning the film successfully draws us into the necessary preparation needed to undertake such a massive venture and the pace, though measured, keeps one constantly engaged. Once on the climb things become quite tense. Stunning visuals of the mountain from all sides are sure to give vertigo sufferers reason to look away even if it is these snow swept images that provide the film with its tension. The camera work is truly amazing. Ditto the stunning sound which realistically captures avalanches and swirling winds in all their horrific beauty."", ""An eclectic cast play second fiddle to the elements of nature, but in a very small role Keira Knightley proves once again what an under rated actress she is. Emily Watson is also strong with a great accent and it is about time that Jason Clarke was afforded a leading role like the one he has here. On the mountain, due to the constraints of the clothing, one sometime loses track of who is who. Also certain plot points are a bit vague (what was going on with the oxygen?). Overall, however, the film is surprisingly better than the conventional disaster movie that one had feared would be its template, and is often quite moving."" ]"
sicario;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The problem with Sicario is that it is too much of an infuriating mystery before it becomes anything else. After a stunningly horrific opening the film meanders disappointingly before advancing the story in to any meaningful or understandable context. Dealing as it does with the drug trade between Mexico and the states, the picture is predictably violent requiring constant viewer attention, but is never boring. The screenplay is generally fine, but there are definitely situations that are questionable plot contrivances (Officials fast tracking cars through the border only to have them caught in a traffic jam; The pointless act of obtaining Blunt’s signature to stop her talking, and even Del Toro’s motive for his involvement in the operation). The traffic jam shootout is actually a very good set piece and, whilst the film may take its time for three quarters of its length, there is no denying the power and tension created in the last half an hour. The sound and music add volumes in atmosphere and the performances of the three leads are good."", ""Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro both play unsympathetic characters. Brolin comes over as smug and confidently self-satisfied whilst Del Toro, giving the film’s best performance, is a silent and mysterious character who can turn impassively violent in a heartbeat. Surprisingly, given the early buzz on her role, Emily Blunt’s character turns out to be very reactionary to the males around her. For much of the running time she hasn’t a clue as to what is going on and seems to be there either to be brutalised or ignored, appearing naïve and out of her depth. Considering that this is the type of lead that would normally have gone to a male star it is all the more surprising a let-down. This is definitely not a performance heading for an Oscar nomination despite her excellence at what little is required of her."" ]"
bridge-of-spies;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A good looking, but too stately and ultimately boring cold war espionage story that outstays its welcome by over half its length. Things start promisingly and one could be forgiven for thinking that the quality was going to match that of last year’s brilliant ‘Imitation Game’. Unfortunately, after 60 minutes the attention starts to wander and the not particularly compelling story begins to lose impetus. The acting is reasonably good, although Tom Hanks is nowhere near his best. The cinematography, however, is gorgeous. This is journeyman Spielberg, probably less, and is punctuated with his usual trademark of mushy music. In his good work his scores are integral and accepted despite all their obvious manipulation. In his underwhelming stuff, of which this must definitely be counted, they almost become the final nail in the coffin."" ]"
trash;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Set against the backdrop of the slums of Rio de Janeiro, this unconvincing drama invites comparison with ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ whilst really being quite different. Three kids working amongst the city’s trash find a wallet full of money which puts their lives in danger as this story of corruption, robbery and murder unfolds. Director Stephen Daldry tries hard to keep a handle on a screenplay which is so convoluted that any tension the drama elicits is immediately diluted by unbelievable situations and lack of logical narrative.  Call me cynical but it is difficult to believe that kids from the slums would act in so intelligent and honest a manner. Streetwise yes, but code breakers? Also, the police always seem to know where they are from scene to scene despite Rio being one of the world’s largest cities in which to disappear. Only at a convenient point in the story do they manage to accomplish this feat. These improbabilities and quite a few others take any urgency away from the many chase sequences and, despite some effective editing, the film never rouses as it should. Ultimately, it feels somewhat pleased with itself as a kind of morality tale, albeit a very pedestrian one. The generally upbeat music owes more than a nod to the score of ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ but is in fact just irritating. Also, the parts delineated by Martin Sheen and Rooney Mara could, and should, have been played by anyone. On the plus side there is some lovely cinematography encompassing the less scenic parts of Rio, but in the final analysis whilst not ‘Trash’ exactly, the film is throwaway non-the-less."" ]"

Whilst up a few notches from the lamentable ‘Quantum of Solace’, it’s also noticeably well below the high standard set by Sam Mendes last directorial effort, the fabulous ‘Skyfall’."", ""Things get off to a flying start in Mexico City with a stunning set piece which gets the anticipatory juices flowing. However, it’s all downhill soon after and by the time the movie has hit the sixty minute mark it is in desperate trouble. Daniel Craig seems completely jaded this time out and Lea Seydoux is a weak and anaemic Bond girl. As the baddies Andrew Scott is refreshing, but I really don’t think I can be alone in stifling yawns at yet another villain from Chistoph Waltz’s seemingly limited canon."", ""In addition to the disappointment of the performances one also feels let down by the action. Aside from the opening and closing sequences which are very good, nearly all the other set pieces and stunts feel bland, second rate and unexciting. The whole enterprise just seems tired and even the usually welcome tongue in cheek humour is sadly absent. None of this is helped one iota by an unmanageable 2 and a half hours running time which leaves one anaesthetised by the singular lack of thrills. Even the song (which admittedly grows on you) is not up there with the greats, and one can’t help but recall an apt line from Adele’s 'Skyfall' – ‘This is the end’. Well, amen to that!"" ]"
the-man-from-uncle;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A stylish but rather empty reboot of the classic 60’s series that is entertaining enough to keep one watching but never really excites. The jokey tone is set early and indulged by its two very handsome leading men, but they strangely lack any chemistry. Henry Cavill as the swathe Napoleon Solo tries way too hard as the American art thief and comes off as far too knowing. Armie Hammer fares better as the Russian KGB operative Illya Kuryakin, but is equally lacking in charisma. Ironically the film also stars Hugh Grant who twenty years ago would have made a perfect Napoleon Solo. Here, however, relegated to a less showy, albeit important, supporting role he hardly registers. On the distaff side the currently hot Alicia Vikander is ok, but the best performance to be had comes from ice cool villainess Elizabeth Debicki. The forced humour is occasionally successful in hitting its mark and two scenes in particular stand out. The first has Solo indulging himself in food and wine whilst a speed boat chase is taking place around him and the second involves an electrocution. Both are perfectly timed and genuinely amusing."", ""The film looks great in all production departments; cinematography, Art-Direction and costume design and the location work is stunning. The plot is occasionally indecipherable and full of holes but strangely enough, unlike the latest Mission Impossible outing, the film is never boring. Another asset is the playful score which adds immeasurably to the class of the film and is just fantastic."" ]"

Although this is not as good as any of those classic 70's disaster movies this one still has plenty of excitement and amazingly good special effects, model work and Art-Direction. The story is perfunctory and the occasional risible line of dialogue raises a good natured smile, but the film entertains hugely and the destruction of San Francisco really is a visual spectacle."" ]"
magic-mike-xxl;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Less serious minded than Steven Soderbergh’s box office hit ‘Magic Mike’ this fluffier sequel is also a lot more fun. The loosely structured screenplay at first seems to only offer up a lot of inane macho chatter and the movie never gels into a cohesively good story whilst also fatally lacking an ending of which to speak. However, approached in the right spirit there is much warmth and humour peppered throughout to keep the enjoyment buoyant. Most of the cast are engaging with Joe Manganiello in particular proving more impressive here than he was in the first film. His striptease in the food store is one of the best scenes on offer. Andie MaCdowell is also given a few nuggets with which to shine leading one question where she has been these past years. The film also benefits immeasurably from some surprisingly good rap music on the soundtrack. This in turn elicits a fairly positive response to a movie that, whilst one wouldn’t rush to see it again, is a guilty pleasure whilst it lasts."" ]"
inside-out-2015;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A dazzlingly sublime idea is executed with rare consummate skill. The film takes us inside the head of a young pre- pubescent girl and, more specifically, her emotions; joy, fear, sadness, disgust and anger. In so doing it unlocks a world that one would have been hard pressed to imagine. Although possibly too complex for very young children they will never the less engage with the colourful and likeable characters. Adults, however, will love it and gaze in awe and wonder as a story and screenplay unfolds that exudes intelligence and imagination. Even pathos gets a genuine look in here which is not often the case in animated films where emotions are often overly manipulated and almost forced out of you. The whole thing is just jaw droppingly hypnotic and provides a definite upward swing in animations fortunes where the offerings of the last couple of years have, generally, been pretty dismal."", ""Supporting this little gem is an even smaller one, an approximately seven minute short called ‘Lava’. The story, completely told via a lovely and witty little ballad about a lonely volcano, is just delightful."" ]"
cinderella;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""After the success of last year’s ‘Maleficent’, both commercially and artistically, another fairy tale gets the revisionist treatment although with far less success. This Cinderella lacks any sense of originality, magic or wonder and is a disappointingly prosaic affair. The finger must be pointed fairly and squarely at director Kenneth Brannagh whose direction is by turns both lack lustre and uninspired. Early scenes of Cinderella enjoying time with her father are painfully saccharine and set the tone for the rest of the movie in which composer Patrick Doyle is unfortunately complicit. His cloying score must be one of the worst of his career and never comes close to equalling the brilliant work he has done in collaboration with Brannagh before on films like ‘Much ado about Nothing’."", ""The cast also, in the main, offer limp or insipid characterisations. Lily James and Richard Madden, as Cinderella and the prince respectively, are desperately lacking any chemistry together and it is ultimately left to Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother and, in particular, Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother to keep any interest alive. Eventually even their amusing moments are engulfed by the dull proceedings and the sea of treacle that drowns any initial enthusiasm an audience may have. Ultimately, It is left to the visuals to provide almost all the enjoyment, and in this area the production design excels as do Sandy Powell’s beautiful costumes. These two branches of film making are the true stars of what is otherwise a very safe and ordinary adaptation of a classic fairy tale that deserved a lot better."" ]"

His deterioration is seen as the film progresses and it is truly heart breaking to witness. We are introduced to a family that love and understand him and to audiences who quite rightly revere him as the legend he is. Archive footage fills in a few background details about his life and children, but the only thing really missed here are the perfect renderings of all those wonderful songs.

Sam Claflin and Max Irons play two students who are newly recruited into the said club, which has been a tradition at their school for many years. Claflin quickly has his nose put out of joint when Irons wins an initiation test forced upon them by the existing 8 members, and the seeds are sown for a revenge which turns out to be more potentially damaging than any of the boys could have imagined."", ""Whereas the play more or less just set the scene for the dinner itself where vandalism, violence and the high jinks of a bunch of ‘spoilt brats’ is the order of the day, the film carefully sets up Claflin's jealousy and dislike for his study partner which results in bloody violence. The set piece, the dinner scene, is expertly handled. Director Lone Scherfig places us right in the middle of the group as a participant one moment and then pulls his camera back to allow us to observe with some horror the behaviour of the so called ‘privileged class’."", ""Most of the actors involved are from the original play staged in London’s west end and everyone seems comfortable with their character. Irons plays Miles as a decent guy with a conscience caught up in events that are essentially alien to him, whereas Claflin totally fits in to the spirit of the group. His is undoubtedly the standout performance."", ""The play was undoubtedly very enjoyable and yet any scepticism about what the film could bring to make the material seem fresh proves unwarranted. In fact the story has actually been pulled in to sharper focus giving more context and understanding of the characters motivations and their subsequent actions."" ]"

Marion Cotillard is the film's ace card and she gives a perfectly judged, nuanced performance elevating the slight material to a higher plane than it may have otherwise achieved. Unfortunately, the body of the film is, by the very nature of its content, to repetitive to really excite. Most of the central act shows Cotillard making house calls in an attempt to rally co-workers to her cause. Ultimately, though, these events leave one only mildly interested rather than compelled."" ]"

Juggling with rather too many story strands it fails to maintain focus and the end result is a sprawling mess. The premise promises much dealing as it does with the search for a child serial killer (based on true facts) circa 1954 in Russia, but anyone expecting a movie in the vein of Zodiac or Seven will be really disappointed as this aspect of the film is given short shrift. More time is spent dealing with the power play between MGB officers bent on keeping its citizens under control at all costs. The film has a few standout scenes most of which involve murder or violence and the final confrontation with the child killer is effective at first instance, but is disappointingly played out. Technically the film is just so so. The cinematography is dark and dingy and the music adds little to the mood. The ending is predictable if quite moving, but such calculated manipulation is in no way a reason to forgive or forget the struggle one has endured in the preceding two hours."" ]"

However, the film soon kicks down these seen it all before expectations via fine acting, edge of seat tension and sheer cinematic technique."", ""Fast rising young actor Jack O'Connell plays a soldier who finds his life in danger whilst trapped in enemy territory on the streets of Belfast. His desperate efforts to get himself back to the safety of the barracks becomes the basic story trajectory. From the moment his character is left behind to fend for himself the film becomes an adrenalin rush of heart pounding tension. Brilliant hand held camera movements act like another character one moment and in the next becomes symbiotic of the chaos and craziness of everything taking place. The film is extremely violent and bloody and is edited for maximum effect. The cumulative result leaves one feeling totally drained."", ""In another great performance, which is only a few notches down from the one he gave in 'Starred Up', Jack O'Connell is again completely believable playing yet another man dealing with extraordinary circumstances. Sean Harris, here the face of corruption, is also as good as always."", ""Like the opening scenes the closing ones disappoint as, again, the all too familiar scenarios are predictably played out.

slow-west;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""The slow in the title is the perfect adjective for this arty western about a love struck boy and a bounty hunter who become companions whilst searching for the same girl, although for entirely different reasons. The film’s destination, however, becomes almost irrelevant as the lack of any real dramatic incident leaves one completely indifferent to where events are heading."", ""Despite a manageable running time this journey becomes something of an endurance test that even the talents of Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn can do nothing to enliven. What little back story there is doesn’t answer questions like why the girl is an outlaw; how the boy knew how to find her, and how he got from Scotland to America considering his naiveté and lack of funds. A few moments do manage to stir one to attention and the beautiful New Zealand locations and a haunting score provide some compensation. Also, as the boy, Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a likeable and sympathetic performance.

More than half a century on she is seeking to have returned to her a painting of her aunt Adele, the woman in gold that was seized by the Nazis back in the 30’s. To this end she hires a lawyer, Ryan Reynolds, and the two of them endeavour to retrieve the art work from the Belvedere Palace where it has since resided for around 60 years."", ""Whilst the story is a good one the film projects such a manipulative air of nobility about it that instead of the intended pathos it more often than not causes the rolling of one’s eyes in laughable exasperation. Reynolds is better than he has been given credit for, although not particularly strong. However, his final speech at the arbitration hearing, is well delivered. The best scenes are those that flashback to the past in Austria. These are compelling and hint at another, better film, asking to be made. The coda is unusual and just reinforces the strident effort that has gone in to making this a manipulative tearjerker. On the positive side production values are good and the film is slickly packaged with a cast of notable character actors popping in and out. Of these, however, Elizabeth McGovern makes for an unconvincing judge."" ]"
clouds-of-sils-maria;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""This ‘All About Eve’ wannabe suffers from an excess of talk and is pretentious in the extreme. Lacking ‘Eve’s style, wit and deliciously rendered performances this film irritates more than it entertains. Juliette Binoche plays Maria Enders, a mature actress who is approached to star in a play that launched her career 20 years earlier. This time she has been asked to interpret the older role of a middle aged business woman, a lesbian who is being manipulated by her young female assistant. In reality, her own assistant played by Kirsten Stewart coaxes her into playing the role. Thus the heart of the film becomes about the two actresses sparring with each other as Binoche tries to come to grips with a role with which she is unable to identify. As these discussions and the subsequent confrontations change their working dynamic the line between the play and reality becomes blurred. As a story outline it all sounds very promising and the actresses, particularly Stewart, give it their best shot. However, they are ultimately let down by the material which disintegrates badly in the mid- section as the two women disagree over aspects of the play and characters. Lovers of pretension will surely run out of superlatives for all the mumbo jumbo spouted. Others, myself included, will merely disengage and lose interest. Surprisingly the film actually rallies a little when Stewart disappears from the scene. This is in not a reflection on her performance, which is probably the best in the film, but it gives a little more mystery and anticipation as to where the drama is going. Unfortunately, a rather ambiguous parting moment is also the final nail in the coffin for a film that never fully gets you on its side."" ]"
the-divergent-series-insurgent;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A rather padded and meandering second instalment for the Divergent series that is definitely not as good as the first film. The problem in the main is that the earlier movie was more interesting as it was setting up the scenario. This one just becomes a kind of futuristic chase movie that is far too long. Plot points often lack clarity and whilst the film is eminently watchable the middle section drags noticeably. Shailene Woodley is a major asset as well as being a great little actress into the bargain. She out acts everyone else on screen even if Kate Winslet and Miles Teller have their moments. To get the most from proceedings it is advisable to have seen the earlier film if just for context. Naomi Watts is introduced here as a potential baddie but she doesn't really come into her own here. However, if the rather good ending is anything to go by, we can look forward to seeing a lot more of her next time when hopefully this film's failings are sorted out and improved upon. Finally, the special effects aren't bad, but there isn't really anything here that hasn't been seen before."" ]"
it-follows;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Even though it is not quite as scary as word of mouth would have us believe this is still a superb psychological thriller rather than an out and out horror movie. Low on bloody gore but high on atmosphere, most of which is wonderfully generated by simple shots such as roads, trees a gate or a swimming pool. These and many other ordinary compositions have been lit and captured in a way that gives the film its eerie sense of menace and dread. In the main the film owes its success to these simple details masterfully directed by David Robert Mitchell. Maika Monroe, looking very much like Chloe Sevigny, registers strongly as the young victim of events, and the nerve jangling score is another great contributor. It is also good to be able to report that the film does not rely on gimmicky shock tactics to raise the hairs on your neck. In fact, there are surprisingly few jumps to be had. Still, this doesn't prevent the film from holding you mesmerised in the palm of its hand for almost its entire running time or, at least, until an unsatisfactory ending somewhat disappoints."" ]"
still-alice;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Handicapped by an inauspicious trailer which affords it the injustice of looking like a disease of the week TV movie, this is actually a small but surprisingly well-wrought drama. Oscar winner Julianne Moore gives an affectingly subtle performance as a 50 year old woman suffering the onslaught of Alzheimer’s. Through the course of the running time she manages to convey the effects of this terrible disease without resorting to histrionics or mawkishness. Her rapid deterioration is utterly believable and the screenplay manages to avoid the obvious clichés that this kind of movie can be prone to."", ""As her daughter, Lydia, Kristen Stewart does a great job of holding her own when on screen with Moore. The film successfully paints the picture of a fractious relationship between mother and daughter which only begins to repair due to the unforeseen and tragic circumstances.

mr-turner;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Opening inauspiciously, Mr. Turner threatens to give credence to the phrase ‘worthy but dull’. As the film goes on, though, it slowly draws you in to the richness of its characters and period. Leisurely paced, beautifully designed and, as with all Mike Leigh’s best films, elevated by some wonderful performances from many of his regular collaborators. Timothy Spall plays the famed painter in the last years of his life as an unsympathetic crude man and is totally believable grunting and scowling his way through the film. Nevertheless, he is all but eclipsed by two women in the cast. Dorothy Atkinson is outstanding as his doting housekeeper, and Marion Bailey is equally fine as the woman who became his last mistress. He meets her during one of his stays at her lodgings in Margate, the town of inspiration for much of his greatest work."", ""Throughout its 150 minutes, director Mike Leigh pays exquisite attention to detail and the look of the film is so precise that you can almost smell and feel the period. The costumes are beautiful renditions of the time but have an authentic lived in look, and the hair and make- up is also of a high standard. Only the music disappoints as it is far to glum and depressing. Admittedly the film is not a barrel of laughs, but there is enough occasional humour peppered within the screenplay to have afforded a less melancholic score from composer Gary Yershon."" ]"
mommy;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""An exhilaratingly original, exciting and audacious work from director Xavier Dolan that holds one spellbound for every one of its 139 minutes. Despite subject matter that could have been either downbeat or depressing the film manages to project both hope and humour in its telling of the relationships between three damaged individuals. Dolan’s skill as a visionary director is on display constantly and his bravura use of the camera is imaginative. This includes the unusual decision to film in the 1:1 ratio as if to reflect the restricted lives under the spotlight. Simple shots and a blend of techniques are equally breath taking to behold and have maximum impact within the context of both the scene and the story as a whole. Dolan is also very well served by his three principle actors who deliver sublimely knock out performances. Anne Dorval as the thick skinned but tackily dressed mother of a violent and uncontrollable son, is a gutsy and loud presence that can’t be ignored. Suzanne Clement, on the other hand, subtly shows us the layers of a withdrawn wife and mother who’s stuttering only begins to subside when around these two larger than life individuals. As the son, Antoine Olivier Pilon is one moment tender and loving and in the next dangerously out of control. All three performances are outstanding and complement each other beautifully."", ""Technically the film is also great. The editing is seamless and impressively clever.

The main problem is with the story itself which just doesn't cut it when compared to some amazing scenes of slapstick timed to absolute perfection."", """", ""Paddington himself is wonderfully realised and uncannily voiced by Ben Whishaw. Let's face it, it's the bear we have come to see and he doesn't disappoint. Scene after scene ignites. The bathroom and cello tape sequences in particular are great fun. Also, there are magical moments involving a dolls house and a miniature railway carriage. In fact, there is so much to enjoy that it is rather a shame that the linking narrative and Paddington's human counterparts start to drag the film down. Ultimately, one is forced to acknowledge the film's unfortunate schizophrenia. Funny and moving it maybe, but sadly it's also rather yawny."" ]"
cake;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Despite an un-prepossessing title Cake is an absorbing and surprisingly moving little film that in the main eschews obvious sentiment and cliché. It tells the story of Claire Bennett, a young woman suffering from chronic back pain following a car accident that also killed her young son. The film affords an actress ample opportunity to knock it out of the park and comedy queen Jennifer Aniston is certainly up to the task. She portrays Claire as both angry and unlikeable, but still manages to elicit empathy for her plight. The screenplay doesn’t lay all its cards on the table from the outset so one is always alert to what this woman’s back story is. The revelation when it comes is not really a big surprise as such, but the drip feeding of information certainly keeps one watching. Supporting characters are well delineated even if the scenes with Sam Worthington are probably the most conventional. Ultimately, though, this is a film that is totally reliant on the credibility brought to the table by its lead actress and Aniston is devastatingly good. Her scenes with Adriana Barraza in particular are especially captivating. Underrated as an actress Aniston is not only one of the best comedienne’s working in films today but here proves her dramatic chops also. It may be a role that had one eye on Oscar, but in this case it would have been totally deserved. I haven’t seen Moore’s ‘Still Alice’ performance yet (although the trailer makes it look like a TV movie of the week), but as far as Witherspoon, Cotillard, Jones and Pike are concerned, my vote would have unquestionably gone to Aniston."" ]"

The story gives the impression of a lot going on, but take out the many obligatory romantic interludes and there is definitely less here than meets the eye. Both the heist and the escape from prison are so easily accomplished that one could believe it would have been harder if the guards had personally let them in and out, respectively.

The story in no way feels contrived and the more intimate scenes are very sensitively handled. Only the depiction of the bullies comes over as somewhat cartoonish, but this in no way spoils a rather tender little film. The ending is lovely."" ]"
selma;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Based on true historical fact, Selma has a great asset in a lean screenplay which omits extraneous story threads in favour of just honing in on the voting rights of blacks in the Deep South. Using the state of Alabama as its anchor the film tells of a series of marches organised by Martin Luther King in order to win those rights. Establishing scenes make one fear that an unwanted history lesson is on the cards. However, once the marches start in earnest the film emits an undeniably emotive power. Scenes of preparation for the peaceful demonstrations are successfully juxtaposed with the violent solutions planned by the police and officials."", ""David Oyelowo is dignified as King and the domestic moments with his wife are tender even as they show him to be a flawed womaniser. Also his scenes with Tom Wilkinson, a standout as Lyndon B Johnson, are probably the best in the movie. Ava Du Vernay's direction is unflashy but she does get the most from her talented cast including Tim Roth, who, as George Wallace, also shares a wonderfully written scene with Wilkinson. For a two hour plus movie it doesn’t really drag once the main narrative gets underway. It’s actually a small film with a big subject matter. The Oscar nominated song Glory which, whilst not that inspired as a piece of music, pertinently and unashamedly declares a suitably victorious outcome for the oppressed."" ]"

The story is also so much more even if its complexity causes the scratching of one’s head in puzzlement from time to time. This is definitely not a story that kids will understand and even a few adults will be left somewhat confused. Never-the less it is a thing of beauty and originality that deserves your money far more than the likes of ‘Minions’ and ‘Big Hero Six’ ever could. The film is also enriched by a beautiful score and a lovely end titles ballad, the ‘Song of the Sea’."" ]"
pride-2014;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Pride is a film to be proud of. What could have turned out to be a schmaltzy, politicized comedy drama full of stock characters and clichéd situations is, for the most part, anything but. Sure, there are political statements being made about a period of British history that affected the lives of many miners, and yes, it also highlights the continuing struggle of the gay and lesbian community circa 1984. However, the film is extremely well written with a strong story and is directed with restraint by Matthew Warchus. He never over extends scenes that threaten to get one groaning in anticipation of the obvious. In fact the tone of the film is just right. The comedy is sometimes laugh out loud funny and the drama is very affecting. One can't help but be moved by many scenes. The cast helps immeasurably, especially the older star names who effortlessly delineate identifiably believable characters. Since Vera Drake, Imelda Staunton has been an actress in demand on smaller quality projects because she is just so good. Her performance here is just confirmation of her stature. Bill Nighy, Paddy Considine and Andrew Scott also stand out. Strangely, Dominic West seems miscast as an older, rather flamboyant gay man, but there is no denying the energy and enthusiasm with which he successfully carries off a big dance number. In this one sequence he almost owns the film."", ""Ultimately, all these pluses add up to a feel good comedy drama that doesn't make the serious issues  it is tackling portentous or heavy. The end titles provide interesting information about the characters and the period in question, some of which was certainly news to me, as was the story told within the film itself."" ]"

Mark Ruffalo is superb, as usual, in a pivotal supporting role, but the real revelation is Channing Tatum. The guy shows us here that he really can act.

the-homesman;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Although The Homesman is beautifully crafted with some striking visuals its uneven tone has a detrimental effect on the movie's end result. Things start promisingly as we observe Hilary Swank going about her daily life on the farm, but as soon as she starts trekking across the prairie to Iowa with Tommy Lee Jones and three mad women in tow the interest quickly starts to dissipate. By the end I felt as if I had been on the journey with them and wasn't far off crazy myself. Swank and Jones are a good pairing with the latter providing some fitfully amusing moments. Swank is at her most outstanding in a very moving scene in which she asks Jones to marry her."", ""Contrary to what the critics have been saying the film is at its best when the surprise exit of a major character allows the film to remove itself from the boredom of the plains. The introduction of other players, notably James Spader (hamming it up deliciously) and Meryl Streep each in their own singular scene, injects some much needed drama into proceedings. This last half hour does, in fact, hint at how good the film could have been had it taken another route."" ]"

Baymax is a lovely character, but the plotting is so predictable that the interest remains muted. Needless to say it's a big hit and sequels will undoubtedly follow, but I for one will sign out here."", ""Far superior is the accompanying short 'Feast' which is an absolute delight. With regards to this double bill, less is certainly more."" ]"
the-theory-of-everything;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The Theory of Everything is basically a very conventional love story at its core. Based on the memoir by Jane Hawking it is at first surprising to find how much the screenplay concentrates on her. It is to the credit of Felicity Jones that she becomes the film’s ace card. She truly shines here as Jane and it is almost totally due to her subtly understated performance that the story’s emotions feel honest and not overly manipulated. Eddie Redmayne is also very good, especially with the physicality the role demands, but surprisingly his role seems somewhat underwritten. The screenplay pays scant attention to his professional achievements concentrating instead on his disability and the challenges this posed to the couple’s marriage. Anyone not knowing anything about Stephen Hawking going in to this film would be hard pressed to understand the reverence in which he is held, the tragedy of his physical battles notwithstanding. Ironically, criticism levelled at 'The Imitation Game' and the lack of personal details about Alan Turing's personal life would be more pertinently aimed here at Hawking's professional one.  Montages are adopted to delineate time lines to mixed success, but probably the biggest indication of the film’s failure is due to the fact that one is more interested in the love story between Jane and Jonathan than in the one between Jane and Stephen."" ]"
horrible-bosses-2;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Very entertaining comedy which is perhaps just a tad overlong. The screenplay may not be the most sophisticated one out there, but it does provide loads of laughs. In fact the dialogue is so fast and furious that some jokes get sacrificed along the way if you so much as look at your pop corn. A lot of the humour is very crude but the playing of the cast is so lively, enthusiastic and good natured that offense is never taken."", ""Jason Bateman makes for an impressive 'straight' foil to the comic goonery provided by Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis,, and both Chris Pine and Jennifer Anniston enter into the spirit of the movie with their tongues very firmly in their cheeks. Only Christoph Waltz is a bit tiresome. The two time Oscar winner's 'wolf in sheep's clothing' grin is beginning to pall a bit in its repetitiveness. He really does need to try and stretch himself in future projects before he becomes to firmly entrenched in the realms of self parody."", ""Overall though, this is a better than average comedy that is consistently good fun."" ]"
into-the-woods;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Being extensively marketed for kids, it is good to find that Sondheim’s musical has been neither dumbed down nor Disneyfied. Taking four well-loved fairy tales complete with linking device and setting them to music is actually quite a bold concept which, for the first ninety minutes at least, works very nicely. In fact, the visuals compliment the score no end which, if listened to cold, is actually fairly resistible without its context. Only one song can truly be considered a hit outside of its theatrical origins and that is ‘Children Will Listen’, but other songs are still impressive. It helps that most of the cast make a good stab at singing even if one recognises their limitations. Meryl Streep, however, is in a class of her own both musically and dramatically. Notching up her 19th Oscar nomination for her ‘witch’ she eclipses everyone with impressive ease. Chris Pine surprises as Prince Charming and he belts out one of the best staged songs, ‘Agony’. Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Emily Blunt as The Baker’s wife and James Corden as the Baker all have their moments to shine as does Johnny Depp as the Wolf. His rendition of ‘Hello Little Girl’ (which shows that Disney have certainly moved with the times, since Snow White sang ‘Someday my Prince will come’) is certainly open to suspect interpretation!"", ""The film looks good in production and costume design and is photographed in a convincingly cold light as befits its dark tone."", ""The film begins to fall apart, however, after its perceived happy ending is suddenly tossed aside with the introduction of a female giant. This is not only dramatically misguided, but also throws the spotlight onto some appalling special effects work. Hitherto the visual effects have been impressive, but the giant played by Frances De LaTour looks cheaply conceived and unconvincing. It is a shame really that what could have been a consistent of a piece musical is undermined by a final act that should have been thrown out along with Jack’s beans."" ]"
whiplash;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Whiplash is a real crowd pleaser which had the audience I saw it with clapping at the end. It moves at a cracking pace, has some very smart dialogue and boasts a couple of very strong performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. However, it is almost a film of two halves. The set up, and then the revenge. The first half of the film, whilst good, feels somewhat contrived."", """", ""Drum playing jazz fanatic Andrew (Teller) goes all out to impress respected but feared teacher Fletcher (Simmons) in the hope of joining the school band he leads. This he sees as his possible route to becoming one of the jazz greats. However, he hasn't bargained on the outrageous teaching methods employed by Fletcher which includes humiliating and even attacking his students. Their fragile interaction puts them on a collision course."", """", ""Both performances are undoubtedly excellent, but Teller really has the more difficult role and stands tall against Simmons more obvious grandstanding. As the cruel and foul mouthed Fletcher, Simmons shouts, swears and screams a lot, much in the vein of an army drill instructor, but these outbursts sometimes have the effect of appearing phony and calculated, merely there to elicit laughs or rouse an audience. Like wise, Teller's acquisition, and subsequent ditching of a girl friend, and scenes of him pushing himself on the drums to the point that his hands become blistered and bloodied, strike false notes. Again,they feel like plot contrivances which, although demonstrating sacrifices made on route to success, actually feel included just to provide fuel for the film's better second half."", ""The final half hour is very satisfyingly concluded as the two actors dual it out to thrilling and nail biting effect. The film also benefits from a  great jazz score which permeates throughout and the film is briskly and imaginatively edited."" ]"
the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""The third and final instalment of this overblown adaptation of the rather slight book arrives with a whimper rather than a bang. Following on from the delight that was ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ this film is an exercise in tedium. Picking up the story as Smaug wreaks havoc on Lake Town village, things start promisingly enough but with the dragon’s dramatic departure we are plunged into scenes of excessive chatter which all but stalls the interest. It doesn’t help that the extras milling around seem amateurish and under rehearsed and a lot of the ensuing dialogue provides unintentional mirth. The battle scenes are badly staged and unexcitingly edited and the film has a messy, untidy feel to it. One actually begins to forget what it’s all about."", ""Apart from Richard Armitage, who is excellent, the actors add little and Ryan Gage is particularly annoying as Alfrid. The score by Howard Shore is by turns soft and melodic and then overly emphatic as it tries to add drama to scenes that are singularly lacking any. Visually the film is still a success, although the CGI occasionally lets it down, but what the film fatally lacks is the fantastical magic and mystery that made the rings trilogy so wondrously brilliant."", ""The last 20 minutes or so improve somewhat as the dwarves fight the dark lord Sauron on the snow and ice. These sequences, along with the opening, sport the best of the visuals and provide the most excitement. Here we are treated to, amongst other things, collapsing bridges, giant birds and cohesive individual combat. Overall, though, one is just thankful when the song ‘The Last Goodbye’ warbles onto the soundtrack. This mercifully offers pleasing confirmation that the uneven trilogy has finally concluded. Amen to that."" ]"
the-judge;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Encumbered by a trailer that doesn't do it justice and critics reviews that keep using the term 'mawkish' as if it's going out of fashion, 'The Judge' turns out to be a much better film than expected. Anchored by two powerful performances Its hefty running time just flies by. I concede that at times it seems in danger of toppling into paint by number TV movie of the week territory, but to its credit this doesn't actually happen. The two Roberts, Downey jnr and Duval, play off against each other perfectly, even if for me Downey Jnr has the edge. He never puts a facial expression wrong and I believed his character totally."", ""A bathroom scene between the pair starts off shockingly but, with perfectly judged precision, becomes lighter as the scene progresses. The delicacy of the playing here makes these moments a highlight."", ""The supporting cast don't really have a lot to do but are all more than adequate and the screenplay to its credit does offer up a fair share of surprising plot twists."", ""On the negative side the score single handedly threatens to derail the whole thing as it is far too syrupy.

annabelle;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Effective little chiller that benefits from some imagination in the direction and three or four scenes that are a credit to the genre. In fact the first real scene of horror is one of which Hitchcock could be proud. The attractive leads are also better than the usual cyphers placed in these types of films and the story is generally quite logically played out. References to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' abound and there are definitely shocks to be had along the way. One sequence involving a sewing machine, a hob and some popcorn is cut to elicit maximum tension. Two supporting players are effectively presented with menacing undertones, but the movie's biggest mystery remains why anyone would want to own such a sinister looking doll in the first place. The final scenes become somewhat predictable, but I must say that it sets up the scenario for last year's' The Conjuring' very nicely, and is actually preferable."" ]"
gone-girl;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Gillian Flynn's book 'Gone Girl' is one of the best novels that I have read in years. It has great characters, intrigue and a bold ending that would definitely not be to everyone's taste. It's a real intelligent page turner that once started can't be put down. The problem with 'Gone Girl' the film is that it has been so faithfully adapted, too faithfully even, by Flynn herself that there are no surprises to be had. I acknowledge that this sounds churlish when there are so many book adaptations that are bad, but the lack of surprise unfortunately dulls the movie experience. The film is well cast. The setting feels right and the score sets an appropriate tone. However, David Fincher's unfussy direction does nothing to add an extra visual dimension to the story. As a result I felt somewhat disappointed by my own reaction, even whilst rationalising the reason for it. As already stated the actors are almost perfect fits for their roles. Ben Affleck is better than I had expected and really carries the film. Rosamund Pike, although over praised, is still good and the supporting cast are pretty much spot on, with a special mention to Neil Patrick Harris. The sequences that involve him are amongst the best in the film."", ""In summation I can only say that for people who have not read the book this should be a most rewarding experience. Fans of the source material, however, might want to think a little harder about there expectations before viewing."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Lacking the spectacle, colour and even the games themselves this is still an enjoyable instalment in what is undoubtedly the best franchise currently being produced. Whilst unquestionably the weakest of the three films to date it still has much to commend it. Top of the list has to be the excellent Jennifer Lawrence for whom the word coasting doesn't seem to exist in her vocabulary. With this role she has created a female heroine the like of whom hasn't been seen since Sigourney Weaver delighted us in the 'Alien' films. The tone of this chapter is certainly darker (even without all the killing) and there is less action and more exposition, but somehow it all works. Julianne Moore is a welcome addition to the cast and effortlessly integrates herself into the film. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman shamefully has little to do in this his last film appearance and Liam Hemsworth is limp and uninteresting as Lawrence's Conflicted love interest. Still, it's all very watchable even though more will be expected from next year's final act."" ]"

The earlier film, however, lacked this one's delightful emotional connection. Helen Mirren doesn't have to stretch herself too much here as a Michelin starred restaurant owner suddenly confronted with competition, but she is superb."", ""The film has been skilfully and lovingly made and director Hallstrom's uses a variety of techniques, aided by smart editing, to make the film's flow seem lyrical and effortless. Tracking shots,super imposed images and fade outs serve the simple cross cultural story well. The radiantly colourful cinematography, the very picturesque setting and the beautifully unobtrusive score combine and contribute to a very tasty dish indeed."", ""All the actors are a delight and the scenes of food preparation are seductively shot to make you feel hungry. My only quibbles are that some of the romantic interludes are conventionally predictable and also the early 'battling' between Mirren and Puri comes over as a bit twee. This aside, however, the film really works and the end result leaves one feeling like you have just par taken of a delicious meal at a fine dining establishment. Undoubtedly one of the most purely satisfying films of 2014, and another that has been undervalued by the sniffy critics."" ]"

Then two more songs quickly follow (Big Girls Don't Cry and Walk Like a Man) within a time frame of 15 minutes. From here on in the film starts to come alive and the second half presents a much more cohesive and digestible movie."", """", ""The opening hour is full of caricature and every cornball cliché in the bio-pic book and makes for tedious, even irritating viewing. This is compounded by an annoying performance from Vincent Piazza as bad boy Tommy, who thankfully all but disappears from the last act. The actors portraying the other band members fare much better. Michael Lomenda is best at delivering the direct to camera monologues, a device which generally adds nothing beyond its gimmicky intent. Erich Bergen stands out as song writer Bobby and John Lloyd Young, after a bit of a struggle, manages to get to grips with Frankie Valli."", """", ""Despite seeming to possess all the right credentials to make the film soar, it has to be said that Clint Eastwood's direction is for the most part both listless and uninspired. The cinematography is flat and the colour palette washed out, especially in the first half. Other production values seem strangely muted for a period piece. There is perfect precision though, in one lengthy but excellent scene revolving around money issues, which also signals the end for the group."", """", ""The last scene over the final credits demonstrates what the film could have technically done better. This sequence is cut well and finally we have some colour and pizzazz in a musical number. Before this, competence alone has reigned supreme leaving the songs themselves to elevate proceedings.

Well, it's certainly dumb but the quality (and even the disappointing setting) is anything but big. Jeff Bridges spends the entire film with a look of angst plastered on his face, and Meryl Streep, in an unflattering wig, once again proves that she is a compelling force despite bad material."", ""The special effects have a cut price feel to them and the only real show of imagination thrown up is to have the film slowly transcend from black and white to colour as the young lead protagonist expands his knowledge.

Children will be able to appreciate and enjoy the archaic action and cute characters, and also be more forgiving of all the nonsense taking place in the final 20 minutes.

Therefore, it is with unreserved enthusiasm that I can recommend whole heartedly this latest chapter in the simian saga. The whole package just couldn't have been put together better, but it has to be said that a lion's share of the credit has to go to director Matt Reeves who previously thrilled us with his visually stunning and equally dark 'Cloverfield'. Helped by a surprisingly dense and impressive screenplay he has managed to inject in to familiar proceedings, depth of character, excitement, pathos and suspense and yet has still found time to inventively position the camera to jaw dropping effect. There is even some slow motion, 360 degree camera pans and knock out crane shots. In fact we have everything here but the kitchen sink and it all works beautifully. The story is good and there is definite deliberation in the pacing which is perfectly judged and balances the action sequences with the many quieter and more reflective moments."", """", ""Technically the movie is everything that you would expect.. The cinematography is dark but luminous. The production design and visual effects are state of the art brilliant and the music gives the film its menacing undercurrent which is underlined by some of the best sound work for ages.

Mark Ruffalo is outstanding here and there is real chemistry between him and Keira Knightley, sporting a very acceptable singing voice. Supporting actors also contribute to the charm, although a little of James Cordon does go a long way. Unfamiliar New York locations are also refreshingly used."", ""Personally I enjoyed it more than John Carney's previous hit, 'Once', and it does share that film's love of music and the endurance of the human spirit.

Unfortunately, edge of seat thrills are what is sadly lacking. Scenes start promisingly enough, but tension is never sufficiently generated and the film sinks under a morass of unfulfilled expectation. There are twists and turns along the way, but these are not handled skilfully enough to make the film a winner and only a couple of moments come close to creating any kind of frisson.

As a movie, fans of the horror and thriller genres will be in their element. Directed with cold efficiency, atmospherically photographed and grippingly edited the film makes many social political statements along the way. Surprisingly the story strands come together fairly well and generally make for credible viewing. However, a scene in which the protagonists take sanctuary in a house of a friend strikes a definite false note and is risible in its ridiculousness."", ""The gulf between rich and poor is a prominent theme as is the corruption of governments and politicians.

However, when he does things liven up no end. For all its other inadequacies, visually this is a stunning achievement. When the titular character and special effects take centre stage there is just no faulting the film as the craft on display is just amazing. Images like a crashed plane; Godzilla in the sea flanked by ships, A Tsunami, A burning train, shadows of the monsters aginst the city's crumbling buildings and Godzilla's face disappearing in to a pall of smoke are just a few of the breath taking compositions to behold. There are countless more, all exquisitely photographed."", """", ""All this good work is somewhat predictably confounded by the dull human angle and perfunctory screenplay.

locke;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Employing the risky premise of one person holding centre stage for an entire film, Locke does not go the way of similar enterprises like 'All is Lost' and ' Buried' and is, in fact, extremely hypnotic.  A solid if slight story line is handed to lead actor Tom Hardy and he delivers in aces changing emotions as he would the gears in his car. His performance is a tour de force master class in acting. For 85 minutes, and from the confines of the afore mentioned vehicle, he runs an emotional gamut  encompassing frustration, barely suppressed anger, sadness and even humour. It is a pertinent reminder, if one was necessary, of just how good an actor he is."" ]"

mad-max-fury-road;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It’s been thirty years since Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome hit the cinemas bearing almost no resemblance whatsoever with 1979’s Mad Max and its sequel in 1981, The Road Warrior. The original Mad Max was uniquely odd and the second film, if memory serves correctly, was exciting if a tad more conventional. Beyond Thunderdome was just a disaster. A copper bottomed clinker that had Tina Turner appear for novelty value in addition to a load of dishevelled snotty nosed brats. This combination ensured thatt the turn off was complete. Thankfully, Fury Road is considerably better than that debacle, but is some way behind the earlier two instalments and is certainly not worthy of the euphoric reviews and praise that have been heaped upon it by both the critics and public, singing in unison for once it would appear. Production values are sound and it must be said that visually the film is an absolute delight. John Seale’s cinematic compositions for day and night are constantly impressive and there is one corker of a moment when what looks like a sand dune suddenly metamorphosis’s into Max (Tom Hardy). There is also much stylisation in the battle scenes with jump cuts adding immeasurably to the impact and editing that moves along at the rate of knots. The sound is another strong plus and whilst there is plenty of appropriate menace in the score one is unprepared for just how beautiful the music is here."", ""So what’s wrong with it? Well, unfortunately, the story is as light as a feather. This is basically just a two hour chase movie and only the most dedicated Max fans will not be tempted to give in to the unerring crash, bang, and wallop pointlessness of it all, despite the many technical strengths on display. Of the actors, Charlize Theron is really rather good in a role that is a million miles away from anything she has ever done before. Nicholas Hoult, unrecognisable under impressive make-up, is ok, but the weakest of the three leads. I use the term ‘lead’ loosely as Tom Hardy’s Max seems to be relegated to a supporting role here, even if the actor turns in another one of his customarily good performances. There is no doubting that Hardy is a better actor than Gibson, but for my money Max 1 and 2 remain the yardsticks by which the other films should be judged."" ]"

Some concise narration at the beginning sets the scene, but the story matters little. Basically this is the formula as before, the main difference being that most of the battles here take place on the sea rather than on land. Production Design vies with CGI for attention and continues to blur the line between these two crafts. Likewise, the somewhat bombastic score competes with Dolby sound. The one thing of which the film cannot be accused is to not have used all the technologies at its disposal. Viewed in an IMAX format and in 3D (D Box was also an additional option) the film is certainly a feast for the eye and ear. The speed ramping gimmick is again employed to enhance the dubious enjoyment of torn flesh, severed limbs and lashings of blood flying off the screen. One thing is for sure, subtlety was obviously not discovered in THIS century."", """", ""Acting wise, Eva Green steals the film and she has an erotically charged scene of sexual power play with leading man Sullivan Stapleton (Strike Back) which is also as camp as Christmas.

Liam Neeson should have rested on his laurels instead of trying to be a new Jason Bourne. In fact this film is worse than 'Taken' and that's saying something.

Chris Pine, Kiera Knightley, Kenneth Brannagh and Kevin Costner all offer up excellent characterisations and it's good to see Knightley out of costume (period costume, that is) for a change. Brannagh, complete with foreign accent, offers up a villain to compete with the best and his directorial style keeps everything fast and furious. He seems to be relishing the change of pace with this film and his previous one, 'Thor', which was an equally action packed and even more ambitious project. In any event both are a long way from the literate and stately Shakespeare movies that have been his signature directorial achievements up to now."", ""Only the final chase sequence lets things down as the story becomes more improbable and frenetic.

Darren Aronofsky, usually one of the best visual directors around, takes a fair while to bring his undoubted talent to the fore concentrating instead on character development and uninteresting family dialogue. Even the visual effects, including some rock monsters that look as if they have just stepped out of a Transformers movie, seem dislocated from everything else going on at this time. In fact, it's not until the tremendous battle for the ark that things start to improve. From here, it's onwards and upwards and the cast finally have some dialogue and drama to sink their teeth into. A crazed Russell Crowe starts to lose it; Jennifer Connelly steals the acting honours in just two scenes; Emma Watson cries a lot, but shows real promise here, and even Ray Winstone is rather good in a baddie role that he can play in his sleep."", """", ""Once aboard the ark Aronofsky finally delivers what one has come to expect from him and the visual effects also become more integrated into the story. The animals arrival at the ark is wonderful as is a backwards tracking shot of the vessel from end to end. Also, one sequence is surprising in its unpredictability. Ultimately you leave the cinema fairly satisfied even as you begin to question things like; if they are the only ones left how did they re-populate?  Oh well, it's only a film."" ]"

However, this is a film about spectacle (and i'm not talking about the tacky disaster films  thrown up every so often) and in this department it delivers in spades."", ""It has pace in abundance and is imaginatively directed employing a variety of camera shots, along with adequate 3D, to impressive effect. The back story is fine and it builds quite nicely to the main event, the eruption of Vesuvius, which is really what we have come to see. The destruction of Pompeii is spectacularly realised with some absolutely stunning CGI which are possibly the best of the year so far (give or take the odd wobble). In fact before all this drama begins there is also much nail biting tension to be had in the coliseum as the gladiators fight it out for survival. This may all seem very familiar but this second half just never lets the pace slip. Fast and furious editing ratchets up the tension and the film, aided by a beautiful and rousing score, holds you in a vice like grip. No excess padding or accusations of over length can be made here. The film is just nail bitingly edge of seat stuff."", ""My only minor quibble is that visually it lacks colour (as did Legend of Hercules) in its costumes, sets and photography, even though in all these departments excellence is otherwise demonstrated. The city is credibly reconstructed and the lighting is often extremely effective.

The film fascinatingly touches on his involvement and explores the possibility of repercussions affecting his Hollywood career. After all one has to admit this is a long way from Disney's Oz."", ""The film does raise many very pertinent points about human conditioning and sexuality which are definitely topics for debate. However, because of its subject matter and some explicit sexual material, it will certainly have a very limited audience. Ultimately, and in all probability, it will find itself preaching to the converted. Oddly, though, it was meant to be a film about the afore mentioned cut 40 minutes.

These 'fallen women' were forced into convents which were run like work houses in order for them 'to cleanse their sins'. Many were in their early teens and most never saw their children again after adoption. This film concerns the search by one such mother,Philomena, who along with a journalist sets out to find the son she hasn't seen in nearly 50 years."", ""Judi Dench plays the title character and her performance is a class act. She gives an effortlessly briliiant and believable portrayal of this tortured, but hopeful woman. She is an actress to whom her art just seems to come naturally and she is again at the top of her game. Steve Coogan is also very good as the journalist and he can take another bow for co-authoring the richly textured screenplay. Whilst the writing tackles serious issues it still manages to tap into some wonderful humour in the midst of this desperately sad situation. The film, though, is certainly never mawkish, but it is at times genuinely affecting. In fact, the only thing that comes out bad here is the light shining on the Catholic Church."" ]"

Still, once the four begin their mission to kill a notorious Taliban leader the film becomes a bone crunching adrenalin rush. Hiding out on a mountain which soon becomes a battleground the four are soon up to there necks in gunfire, explosions and blood. These battles excitingly staged and full of nail biting tension are enhanced by hand held camera photography which effectively creates a sense of chaos and confusion. Sound effects unflinchingly capture every bullet impact, fall or smashed body part as the four find themselves battling an army of Taliban whilst not having any immediate means of escape.

Things are not helped by Meryl Streep's initial appearance in which she is way over the top, the mechanics of her particular acting style all too visible. It takes about 30 minutes for the film to properly  find its feet with both acting and writing seeming very uneven. However, with the very entertaining dinner sequence events seem to come very much alive. Streep settles brilliantly in to her bullish and bullying matriarch and the writing also finds its natural rhythm, ultimately telling a good story with more than a few surprises up its sleeve. Julia Roberts, often too knowing in her roles, is fantastic here. In between all the fights and vitriol going around she shows great subtlety in some of the quieter scenes with her facial expressions doing a lot of the work. Margo Martindale also has a corker of a scene which propels an important plot point. In fact the women in the cast outshine their male counterparts by a considerable margin. At the film's close it came as somewhat of a surprise to realise just how much I had enjoyed the preceding two hours."" ]"

The design of the film, as in a lot of Anderson's work, is just beautiful and many effects are visually striking. A positive roster of character actors contribute to the fun (Saoirse Ronan's lack lustre turn aside) with Tllda Swinton and  Willem Dafoe standing out. Everything is elevated, however, by the absolutely brilliant performance of Ralph Fiennes which is second only to his Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. I may still have reservations about Anderson and to a lesser extent this film, but if Fiennes isn't nominated for an Oscar next  year for this deliciously sublime portrayal then that will be more of a farce than the film itself."" ]"

It actually played more like a thriller than a small drama. The Past seems to be trying to replicate the formula, but for the most part it fails. In actuality it is a well acted but fairly ordinary film which only really comes alive in the last section when the true catalogue of events is finally revealed. Here the movie adopts 'A Separation's' bravura style and becomes more interesting. The shame is that by only half heartedly emulating the earlier film this one, by comparison, ends up being bland. Whereas 'A Separation' soared from beginning to end, The Past only flutters AT the end. Of the afore mentioned performances Tahar Rahim is the best as Berenice Bejo's boyfriend."" ]"

It seems to exist in no man's land wanting to be all thing's to all people and ending up offering very little of anything to anyone. It's not CGI heavy or action packed enough to be considered a block buster and it's too redundantly lame to be good romantic/comedy/drama. In fact what we have is an anaemic romance that provides a linking device to a series of visual fantasies. These fantasy moments which crop up about every 15-20 minutes are, in themselves, not too bad, but they can't prevent the film from seeming half hearted and empty. Ben stiller is ok as the lead character zoning in to more exciting worlds, but I much preferred Adam Scott as one of the heads of Life magazine where Stiller works. His presence, as a kind of villain, bucks one up whenever he appears. The same cannot be said for Sean Penn in a small cameo. This is certainly a strange choice of movie for him. I just hpe he isn't heading down the same road taken by Robert De Niro, destination nowhere, artistically. Locations in Greenland and Iceland are stunning.

This Second World War story is based on a best selling novel but its adaptation here is protracted and bloodless and must be classed a major disappointment. Young Sophie Nelisse, as the titular character, looks the part but her line delivery at times comes over as phonetic. The production itself looks immaculate, but again this is also a big problem. as everything is just so pristine. At one point Emily Watson berates the girl as being 'filthy' when in fact she looks as if she is on her way to a photo shoot. A bogus in-authenticity pervades and prevents the film from generating any true emotion or pathos. John Williams' pretty score adds to the detrimental effect and actually feels as if it belongs to another type of movie in another era. A couple of scenes do ignite. The cellar search grabs one's attention temporarily and the ending, coming as it does from left field, causes one to stir in a way that the rest of the film never does. I also have to mention that the scene where Geoffrey Rush plays his accordion whilst everyone is hiding in an air raid shelter, made me think that the cast were going to start singing Oom Pah Pah a la Carol Reed's musical Oliver!  One thing I did like was the unusual narrative device which is intrigueingly employed at the beginning and used to devastating effect at the end."" ]"

Pennsylvania looks every bit as bleak as I remember it from 'The Deer Hunter' and this is perfectly captured in the stark cinematography. The camera's eye treats the steel mill and surrounding areas as if they are another character and you really do get a sense of the place and the unfulfilled lives of the people living there. At times the film's tone is extremely tense, a lot of which is due to the menacing performance of Woody Harrelson who looks as if he has just stepped out of 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Christian Bale, in a rare understated but none the less brilliant turn, is even better here than he is n his Oscar nominated role in 'American Hustle'. Casey Affleck and Willem Defoe also impress and one has to applaud Sam Shepard, who seems to have an uncanny knack for being only minimally involved in really good films. The music is surprisingly beautiful given the content, which is at times extremely violent, and the film holds you in a vice like grip from beginning to end. Ironically, it is only the overt symbolism attached to the deer hunt and bare knuckle fight scenes that can be slightly criticised but, in truth, to do so would be pernickety as this is a truly outstanding film."" ]"

From this dysfunctional background sprung forth her flying nanny. The other half of the film is indeed about the making of the famous 1964 movie starring Oscar winning Julie Andrews, which is in itself over rated."", ""The main problem is that the film is boringly repetitive and the juxtaposing of Travers' child hood with her time in L A is totally un-interesting. Things aren't helped by Emma Thompson's irritatingly mannered and tiresome performance (An Oscar nomination I have heard mentioned. REALLY!!!!!!). Also Tom Hanks' brilliance as Captain Phillips has certainly been hijacked here in his playing of Walt Disney. In fact the best parts of the film involve the Sherman brothers composing or performing the now famous music. I also have to admit to loving the line  Poor A A Milne' which Ms Thompson utters in disgust on finding a stuffed Pooh bear in her hotel room. However, aside from the occasional line of inspired dialogue, most of the script has Thompson constantly enunciating in the negative which becomes wearisome indeed.

All the series' constants are present including impressive make-up and special visual effects, as well as beautiful Art-Direction and great sound.

Aside from an awful supporting performance from Stephen Fry as 'The Master of Lake Town', 'The Desolation of Smaug' really does deliver.

Watts' committed performance is actually very good and she captures Diana's body language, mannerisms and vocal inflection perfectly. The main issue is that the script makes the central love story totally ordinary and uninteresting. To this end Naveen Andrews dull performance doesn't help and a lack of chemistry between the two leads is palpable. The film is watchable and not quite the debacle that dismissive critics have suggested, but a decent dullness is the keynote. Iconic images from newspapers and magazines are captured and integrated effectively, and some information was new to me.

The man himself comes over as a paradox, charismatic on one hand, but also Machiavellian and self serving. His life has certainly been eventful, what with his bout with cancer, and one does get a sense that he feels a deep sorrow about the lie that not only crushed him, but also affected the lives of many others. The film pertinently points out that even though his 7 championships were won with the help of drugs, this was in an era when the whole sport was tarnished in this way. It's also interesting to be privy to other smaller corruptions that were taking place on the track, with intense rivalries not just between other teams and individuals, but also between team mates!

lee-daniels-the-butler;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Interminable plod through America's civil war movement seen through the experiences of a Butler serving several presidents over many years in the White House. The film cannot escape the feeling of being fake, trivialised and manufactured in its self important telling of an awful chapter in American History. It also feels very second hand with key events mostly being depicted via archive footage, mainly on a TV screen. Also, as soon as anything bad or dramatic happens the obligatory music kicks in for added impact often with that reliable crutch, the gospel choir at hand. This has the effect of producing schmaltz rather than gravitas."", ""A starry cast, generally playing presidents or first ladies to mixed success, give a cough and a spit and are gone. However, anyone expecting (as I did) for this to be a more serious expose of White house politics will be sorely disappointed. This is first and foremost about the Butler and his family. The film has a lot to say potentially, but ultimately, due to the story's priorities very little is actually said. Forrest Whittaker and Oprah Winfrey are undeniably good, but this is Oscar bait work to be sure. For a really natural and un self conscious performance just watch the far superior Lupita Nyong'O in the artistically much better 12 years a slave. No grand standing here, just great work! On the technical side the film is nothing special. The cinematography at times has a grainy look to it and it's definitely far too long. By the film's close I felt that I had aged with the two leads and lived the history."" ]"

These afore mentioned backing artists, and others, share with us their frustrations, disappointments and the love for what they do. And let's not forget their talent. In many instances they are vocally superior to many of the lead entertainers that they support. However, as Sting so concisely puts it, 'It's not always about the talent'.

american-hustle;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Anticipating American Hustle I was convinced that it would be one of my top films of the year. After all it has a great cast, a talented director and a trailer that makes it look exciting and complex. Unfortunately, its complexity is a major flaw. The story is so convoluted that maximum attention is demanded. However, excessive lengh and a tendancy towards the pedantic encourages the attention to wander. The cast give it their all. Christian Bale continues to create zany out there characters; Jennifer Lawrence is fun, but obvious; Bradley Cooper is way over the top, and Jeremy Renner flies under the radar.The real news here is Amy Adams who all but steals the film. Excitingly cast against her usual 'good girl' type, she gives a power house performance that is her best to date. She and Bale are the film's strongest asset and it benefits from their chemistry together. Production values are spot on in depicting the 70's fashion, with hair and costumes creating a great diversion. It also contains a wonderful pop soundtrack of the era which encourages one to reminisce. In the final analysis American Hustle, sadly, lacks something. This leaves one feeling that the whole does not add up to the sum of its,quite excellent, parts."" ]"

Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley give remarkably fresh performances helped no end by an intelligent screenplay. Teller is utterly charming and Woodley is believably vulnerable (so different from her Descendants turn). At the start of the film I did have some difficulty in catching all the dialogue and at first I wasn't sure if it was down to the actors' delivery or just due to appalling sound. It actually must be the former as once I got used to the performers dialect the problem disappeared. The film is basically about life growing up and all the pleasures and pain that entails. The film's tonal changes are perfectly handled (including one absolutely shocker of a moment that had me literally gasping as it was so unexpected) and the end result is surprising and richly rewarding. It's also great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh back on screen albeit in a thankless mother role. I must say that I went to this film with no expectations and I knew absolutely nothing whatsoever about it. Well, it certainly lives up to its title's adjective as it is spectacular indeed!"" ]"

carrie;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""After over 150 viewings Brian De Palma's 1976 version of 'Carrie' remains my favourite film of all time. Therefore, if anyone was going to take issue with this remake it was going to be me. The first thing to be said about this new version is that as a film in its own right it does work. Kimberly Peirce is to be commended for doing a credible job in attempting to put a fresh slant on the material. The big question hanging over the whole enterprise, though, is whether a remake was really necessary. The answer to that has to be a resounding NO. However good Peirce's version is it compares unfavourably, in every aspect, to the sublime master class of De Palma's film. I have always viewed the original as more of a social commentary than an out and out horror movie and De Palma effortlessly switched gears between the comedy, horror and romance. This combination made his vision a very satisfying experience"", ""Performance wise, Chloe Grace Moretz is actually better than I think she has been given critical credit for in the title role, but let's face it she was never going to come close to topping Sissy Spacek's iconic playing of the character. Likewise Julianne Moore, an actress whom I greatly admire, grounds her Margaret White in a more believable reality than did Piper Laurie. However, I still prefer Laurie's over the top loon. Also one misses Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, John Travolta, Betty Buckley and PJ Soles. Their replacements do not come close to the incarnations of those original actors. In fact Ansel Elgort (Tommy Ross) and Barry Shebaka Henley (Principle Morton) are noticeably inferior to their original counterparts."", ""Even though Peirce has stated that she was returning to the book for this new version, it does feel at times as if she is cherry picking from the novel as well as plagiarising De Palma's film. For older viewers the new version suffers also from audience expectation as scenes and lines of dialogue are anticipated and compared, even if unwittingly, to the superior original. The prom scene 2013 totally lacks the magic and romanticism of De Palma's version and the blood falling on the hapless Carrie, shot from three angles, is totally mis-judged. Similarly, Moretz's playing of the all encompassing revenge that follows is interpreted here as being enjoyable, where as Spacek plays the scene as cathartic, with eyes staring blankly in shock. On the plus side Peirce does handle well the scenes of Carrie's experimentation and discovery of her telekinetic powers. Where her version fails most is with the style. Brian De Palma is all about style, and his set pieces are just jaw droppingly brilliant. He incorporates split screen and slow motion amazingly and to great romantic and nail biting effect. Aided no end by his talented leading lady and her vulnerable and achingly believable portrayal, De Palma's take on the story WILL never be bettered. Also in his corner is that great Pino Donnagio score; The moving relationship that is seen to develop between Spacek and Buckley (which is totally redundant in the new version) and THAT ending. Peirces's last scene was never going to recapture what De Palma achieved. Her ending is somewhat lame and superfluous, underlining the fact that whilst her 'Carrie' is enjoyable entertainment, De Palma's 'Carrie' is a justifiably revered classic."" ]"

adore;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""I have to say that I adored adore. It is a guilty pleasure that I'm sure would have made a good tv mini-series as it doesn't exhaust its own possibilities within the movie. Based on a short story by writer Doris Lessing it is easy to see why cynical highbrow critics would dismiss it as soap, and indeed many have panned it. I am at a loss to know why as it is intelligently adapted and written by Christopher Hampton and Anne Fontaine, who is also the film's director. In fact the writing is generally superb presenting some improbable situations in a natural and believable fashion. Some unintentional humour does creep in from time to time, but overall I was compelled to follow the story's arc. The performances are superb with Robin Wright the standout. Looking more and more like Jessica Lange, she is particularly moving. In scene after scene, many of which are filmed in extreme close up, every nuance of emotion is there to behold on her face. She is stunning here and I am tempted to say that it is the best I have ever seen this under rated actress. With its attractive cast and beautiful locations the film also looks great."" ]"

An intelligent screenplay allows Scorsese to put his indelible stamp on the material.

The end result is a superior mystery thriller, even though a few questions do remain unanswered. The performances contribute a great deal. There is no denying that Hugh Jackman is very good here but he is playing a rather dislike able character, even given the circumstances. His frequent rants tend to dissolve into monotone. Jake Gyllenhaal is much better as the cop. With his constant eye tics and suspicious nature he is the true heart of what makes prisoners ultimately as good as it is.

At a modest  93 minutes there is a lot to pack in and at times scenes seem to end with an exclamation mark to lead us succinctly in to the next chapter of L L's life. The film is very well served by its actors. Amanda Seyfried has never before given such an accomplished performance, but that being so she is still eclipsed by Peter Sarsgaard as her husband Chuck Traynor who, as painted here, is very much the villain of the piece. Sarsgaard is breath takingly brilliant and steals the acting honours from a strong line up of character actors with some ease. An unrecognizable Sharon Stone also registers strongly in support as Linda's down trodden mum and the choice of soundtrack and costumes fit the period to perfection.

The film is also beautifully shot and designed and DePalma has lost none of his skill for drawing the viewer in. What the film does lack, surprisingly, is any really good set pieces which are often the director's piece de resistance."", """", ""The first hour is compulsive viewing as the female protagonists scheme and manipulate ensuring audience intrigue as to where events are going, but with the demise of one of the characters the film begins to fall apart and, unfortunately, it never recovers. This is a story weakness because 'Love Crime' also suffered the same problem at the same point but did manage to get back on track for a good ending. DePalma presents us with his own special kind of ending that just doesn't work here. In fact this final sequence is yet another failed attempt to repeat the 'Carrie' finale which succeeded because it had a genuine shock at its conclusion. Interestingly, the music used for this final sequence would seem to have been lifted straight out of 'Dressed to Kill'"", """", ""The verdict has to be that whilst this is not vintage DePalma, it deserves better than to be shunted out as a 'Straight to DVD' release as has been its fate in the UK.

Tamsin Egerton as Fiona Richmond, Anna Friel as his first wife Jean and Imogen Poots as his daughter Debbie are also all very good. That their performances survive this unremarkable material is to their credit. The film doesn't seem to be able to decide if it's playing the whole thing for comedy or not, despite its tragic conclusion. It ends up being a tedious mess which never satisfactorily brings together the sum of its parts. One learns more about these characters at the end titles than is ever communicated through the preceding 100 minutes. A definite plus is the use of popular 60's and 70's hits on the soundtrack. A definite minus is David Wailliams' out of key supporting turn which would be more at home in one of his tv sitcoms."" ]"

It's ace card, however, is in the hypnotic and multi layered performance of Soren Malling as the C E O of the company whose ship is taken. Whether demonstrating authority, rage or empathy he is central to one's involvement with what is happening on screen. The movie itself could have been tightened up slightly in the mid section where hijackers and hijacked become tentatively and temporarily attuned to one and other.

Family and friends intelligently articulate memories about this complex woman and specifically highlight an affair she had and its subsequent repercussions.

His hesitant but caring character is so unlike anything else he has done, and you are rooting for him to become romantically involved with Joanna Vanderham from there first meeting. The screenplay is for the most part good, but I do feel that Julianne Moore's part is written (and played  so broadly that her character is in danger of being turned into a 'bad mum' caricature. This also has the unfortunate side effect of making Skarsgard and Vanderham's characters almost too saintly. Another slightly  baffling thing in the story (unless I missed something) is how did Skarsgard and Moore know Where Vanderham and the little girl were when they moved to the beach house. Still, I'm being picky as this is one of the better films of the year so far. Onata Aprile as Maisie is perfect lacking any of the precociousness often found in child performances."" ]"

The main problem is that it's setting and story is less appropriate for this over the top kind of  approach. Moulin Rouge was set in a musical revue nightclub and therefore all the outrageous antics could be more readily embraced. The first half feels like Luhrmann wanted to make a musical and was taken with the ides of wild parties, decadence and lavish costumes only to discover halfway through that he had a story to finish telling. In fact it's only when Gatsby turns to 'straight' drama that it works at all. Generally it's a visually stunning mess, although even here everyone and every thing is so perfectly positioned and placed that the artifice in scene after scene wins the day. Performances are unexceptional although DiCaprio acquits himself well. There is less to be said for Tobey Maguire. His performance as neighbour and story narrator Nick Carraway, is bland and borders on the boring. The writing is trite and often undermines the visual style. For all the criticisms that have been levelled at the 1974 Redford/Farrow film, it must be said that the writing, acting and screenplay were all superior to this frenetic self indulgence. On the plus side the main musical theme is just beautiful."" ]"

The voice over narration from the girls' point of view presents it as a kind of utopia that the accompanying visuals deny. There is no denying the technical package, though. Stylised direction, eye catching cinematography and skillful editing help to ensure that the film looks slick and professional and yes, after abandoning my initial misgivings, the film does become hypnotically compelling. James Franco, in another 'out there' performance, is just great as the rapper/gangster Alien and the music by Cliff Martinez adds a whole other dimension to the proceedings. One of the best scenes has James Franco playing piano and the three remaining girls singing a sweet Britney Spears song whilst inter cuts show the violence they have  perpetrated.

There is a lot of back story exposition before the unremarkable ending, (one sudden shock involving a minor character not withstanding) and to say that the plot development requires much suspension of disbelief is to understate. Overall it's a pity because the first half an hour had me enthralled. At best this effort by Danny Boyle can only be considered an interesting mis fire."" ]"
texas-chainsaw-3d;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A slick addition to the horror franchise with good production values and enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat when you're not jumping out of it. This new film is not half bad picking up from where the original 1974 film left off. For horror fans this more than delivers. The first hour is well modulated to build the expected tension as the usual array of attractive young teens go through their paces of being terrified, hunted and finally butchered by the fearsome leatherface. The final half hour brings to the fore more everyday recognisable villains, in this case in the guise of the local police force. At this point the film effectively switches our sympathies towards leatherface against the authorities, and whilst this last section doesn't quite pack the punch of the first hour it still keeps you engaged. The film has some great photography, including low slung camera angles and overhead crane shots, which add much to the uneasy atmosphere that pervades the film. The editing also skilfully ensures that we are not let of the hook (so to speak). Let's face it this is the sort of film that gives you exactly what it says on the tin and it certainly touches a primal nerve in me.

The cinematography and special effects are amazingly good and the music score and sound stirringly compliment the visuals. Heartfelt performances by Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland add pathos to the proceedings. On the evidence I'm now totally convinced that this wonderfully intense movie experience is as close as I ever want to get to a real Tsunami."" ]"
gangster-squad;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Ferociously edited and directed with some style even if the screenplay is some what suspect. As written here this gangster squad veer between, at best, opportunistic and, at worst, downright inept. The film is always fast moving and entertaining and the production values are excellent. Josh Brolin gives the best performance as the squad's leader John O'Mara. Sean Penn is at his scenery chewing worst as arch villain Mickey Cohen and Ryan Gosling, in an unusually bland role for his superb actor, is rather colourless. Emma Stone has little to do as the obligatory female love interest as is also the case with many well known faces in supporting roles. Still, as undemanding entertainment you can do a lot worse."" ]"
easy-money;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""This is a very disappointing movie that amazingly is made somewhat tolerable by the commanding presence of lead actor Joel Kinnaman. His portrayal of the naive chancer is so deserving of a better film. The story lacks context and focus and is surprisingly quite a drag lacking in any real tension,pace or cohesion. The last 20 minutes or so kick things into high gear, but for a two hour plus film it really is a case of too little too late."" ]"
a-royal-affair;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A Royal Affair is quite simply the best historical costume drama that I have seen for years. This is what one hopes for every time from this type of film and all to often what one gets is the debacle of something like 'The Affair of the necklace'. An unknown (to myself) period of history comes to life in the three areas that matter in a film like this. The acing of the three leads is fantastic with special praise going to Mikkel Boe Folsgaard as the king on the edge of sanity. His performance in a supporting role is the best of this year. The design and costumes are truly beautiful, and last but by no means least the writing where most films of this ilk fall down badly. Not here, however. The story is propelled onwards and upwards by intelligent dialogue delivered with expert precision by the entire cast. At the moment it seems to me that the Danes have cornered the market in quality entertainment, not only in film, but also on tv where their output is also of an extremely high standard of late (Borgen; The Killing; The Bridge to name a few). See A Royal Affair at all costs as it is a gem of a film that has almost slipped by un noticed due to its minuscule release. If you like well acted and beautifully written period dramas about royalty you won't be disappointed."" ]"
world-war-z;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""It's not bad for a zombie movie that has, reportedly, had a troubled production. Marc Forster directs with confidence and energy managing a large cast and the CGI to good effect. Ariel shots of crippled or panic stricken cities are impressively delineated and the mayhem is excitingly edited to within an inch of it's celluloid life, deploying the odd shock tactic to jumpy effect. The film has holes and implausibilities in abundance, but it is never less than entertaining. Two set pieces stand out. One aboard a plane and another, at the film's climax, in a lab. Both are riveting. Sound Design is excellent and the music unnervingly adds tension to the proceedings. In summation it is a lot better than anticipated."" ]"
the-eye-of-the-storm;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Adapted from Patrick White's dense novel, this adaptation is fairly faithful to its source material, but is mainly notable for three strident performances. As an eccentric actor Geoffrey Rush wonderfully conveys much of the humour in the piece. Charlotte Rampling is good as the matriarch of this dysfunctional family playing her at two stages in her life, even though she does tend to pull off the younger woman better than the dying mother. This is purely because she looks and acts too young (she is in fact less than ten years older than Rush playing her son!). Still I do understand her casting as there are not many actresses who look as good as Miss Rampling at nearly 70 who could have had the gravitas to fit the dual role so well. Which brings us to Judy Davis. Her performance as the spoilt daughter is the standout. The way she conveys her character through some amazing facial expressions is just mesmerisingly brilliant. The film on the whole is a pleasant and undemanding entertainment."" ]"
anna-karenina;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Visually sumptious - The production design and costumes are truly beautiful and the film does look a million dollars - this version of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a triumph. Imaginitively and boldly directed within a theatre setting, Joe Wright elicits a good performance from Keira Knightley (who always seems to walk a tightrope between good and bad in her films) and a scene stealing performance from Jude Law as her betrayed husband.  Beautiful and underrated the film rewards an audience prepared to wait for the gradual unfolding.  Knightley certainly gets better the longer she inhabits the character. Another plus is the lush music score by Dario Marianelli which quitely adds volumes to the atmosphere of what is taking place on screen."" ]"
deadfall;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A car crash, four deaths and a finger sliced off and that's all in the first 20 minutes. Deadfall is certainly not without incident. However, after the first half an hour it all starts to get a little dull despite all the action. It's only when the drama moves into the home of Kristofferson and Spacek that some real tension and emotion is able to spring forth. For the rest of the time the film feels disjointed and lacks any real rhythm. Performances are decent, despite some stilted dialogue, and the snowbound scenario is also good value. On the whole, though, this is just like your average B movie."" ]"

The three leads are not served well by the story or setting and i'm sure in a better focused film they would be considered excellent in their roles. However, that's what might have been. Paul Thomas Anderson seems to enjoy making these long and profound films and whilst I enjoyed 'Boogie Night' and There Will be Blood' to some extent I wouldn't say either of them were completely successful either. Also disappointing was the rather bombastic score. Only the cinematography shines through here. The end result was so what!"" ]"
flight;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""whatever else may be wrong with this film it certainly has nothing to do with Denzel Washington's committed and convincing portrayal of an alcoholic pilot under suspicion for negligence after the aircraft he was piloting crash lands killing six people on board. The crash sequence is extremely well handled wringing out maximum tension.  Once grounded, though, the screenplay introduces us to sundry supporting characters that tend to make the story seem very disjointed. Each scene seems to feel like a tiny vignette filling in the background detail of his life which holds little real interest.. The Introduction of drug user Kelly Reilly also doesn't really add the necessary spark. In fact her main purpose is to show that her road to recovery is a lot quicker than the path Denzel's character chooses. The final outcome is somewhat predictable, but before the cloying reunion scenes with the estranged son, there is a really good key scene where bye Denzel is interrogated by a wonderfully understated Melissa Leo. Here the film really packs a punch, but for most of it's excesive running time Flight just doesn't take off."" ]"
lincoln;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Lincoln is a film of two halves. The first hour and a half is what the term 'worthy, but dull' was coined for. Tony Kushner's acclaimed screenplay seems to be all over the place and, not being an expert on the history, I was confused. However, something rather magical happens when the excellent Tommy Lee Jones takes to the floor of congress to vent his wrath with rivals over the passing of an amendment to abolish slavery. The film comes alive and subsequent proceedings are elevated to a much higher plane. This ensures that the final hour not only engages the brain, but becomes compelling drama. Director Steven Spielberg has dealt with the slavery issue before in both 'The Color Purple' and the extremely tedious 'Amistad' so he obviously has some fascination for the subject. One could, therefore, be forgiven for thinking that he would bring something new to the material. Unfortunately, he doesn't! As with 'Amistad' his direction is staid and unexciting for the most part despite some occasional arty looking set ups. Daniel Day Lewis, on the other hand, inhabits the character of Lincoln to perfection. Not once do you feel it is an actor portraying a character. This Chameleon like actor has pulled off another coup in a performance to rank alongside the very best in his already dazzling portfolio. The film's period detail is beautifully captured and photographed like a series of paintings and Spielberg has, at least, eschewed sentimentality. To this end, though, he is not aided by John Williams' pretty but predictable score, one which I seem to have heard many times before."" ]"
les-miserables;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""It is now nearly thirty years ago that I saw the theatre production of Les Miserables and whilst I remember enjoying it at the time it hasn't remained prominent in my memory aside from THAT song. Therefore, I approached this new film version with some trepidation aware that the first trailer for it had cheated somewhat by editing various images from the film to the aforementioned song. Also with Tom Hooper at the helm, and having been one of  a minority of people who really disliked 'The King's Speech', I was doubly cautious. Gratifyingly all my misgivings are for nothing as the new film is nothing short of magnificent. In fact, the theatre experience is clarified and heightened here. The simple and effective story is propelled along by a stunningly beautiful score (I really didn't remember it being this good), a great sense of period, and committed performances which elicit emotional responses almost constantly. Tom Hooper has done the material proud and is well served by a magnificent cast. Hugh Jackman, it seems, was born to play Jean Valjean over punished for stealing a loaf of bread and then persecuted for ever after by Javert, played by Russell Crowe. Anne Hathaway is stunning and her delivery of the famous ' I dreamed a dream' is truly heartfelt. Eddie Redmayne, likewise, has a revelatory singing voice and also breaks your heart with his sorrowful rendition of 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' sung after his fellow revolutionaries are all killed. Samantha Barks' exquisite voice also has a great solo with the lovely 'On my Own', and Russell Crowe, after a shaky start, also pulls off a couple of songs with great aplomb, whilst showing us a conflicted character always on the edge (literally in a couple of scenes). It seems to me that he has been rather underrated in such exalted company, but he is excellent. Comic relief is provided by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter during their rendition of 'Master in the House'. and only Amanda Seyfried comes over as a bit colourless and insipid. Hooper's decision to let the actors sing live is a very good one and adds to the cumulative emotional effect in scene after scene. Like wise, he opts for close ups when filming the big musical numbers, but he is in no way enslaved by them as the magnificent production design is often shown off to jaw dropping effect. Cinematography too is sublime and perfectly captures the contrasting worlds of the eclectic bunch of characters. The new song 'Suddenly' is slightly below par, and on a couple of occasions the score reminds me of the Lionel Bart musical 'oliver!' but this is only a fleeting recollection as Les Miserables is very much its own musical. At 158 minutes it is a long movie, and in truth there is a slight, if temporary, dip in interest around the 100 minute mark when the young revolutionaries take over the story. However, the big emotion emitted as the film races towards its finale soon puts any negative thoughts to bed. As the credits start to roll you sense the audience members just want to stand, as in a theatre, and applaud."" ]"
django-unchained;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Quentin Tarantino gives us another trademark film which, whilst acknowledging the spaghetti westerns of the 60's, is also a true original. The film has some great writing and is performed with relish by an enthusiastic cast playing colourful characters in a film full of colour in every sense of the word. Christoph Waltz does a sort of reprise of his 'Inglorious Basterds' character but is much nicer here, and Leonardo Di Caprio cast against type plays Calvin Candie with villainous relish. For the most part this is a fun journey. Tarantino definitely subscribes to the notion that nothing succeeds like excess, and bloody excess at that! The film is audacious, humorous, violent and a lot of the time played with its tongue firmly in its cheek. Music, including some fabulous new songs, is also used to perfect effect. It's also a pleasure to see a bunch of character actors from the 60's and 70's popping up in supporting roles to remind us of how good they were, and still are"" ]"

Kristin Scott Thomas (always classy) and Ludivine Sagnier are both great as the sparring work colleagues. Friends, and enemies by turn, they are fascinating to watch as the fabric of their relationship unravels. The first hour of the film is compelling and one is engaged in a story that promises more than it ultimately delivers. Events become more puzzling and rather unsatisfactory however, following the demise of Scott Thomas. All along we know what the denouement will be, but the film is so long winded in getting there that a loss of interest is inevitable. The black and white inter cuts do a good job of clarifying things in the second half and the final scene ends on a high."" ]"

pitch-perfect;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Pitch Perfect is an extremely joyful and funny film full of wit and great dialogue. The jokes spew forth (quite literally on two occasions) at the rate of knots and all performances rise to the occasion wonderfully. Comparisons with Glee are inevitable, but singularly favourable to this achievement (No sequel please). Glee became joyless for me quite quickly (aside from some wonderfully staged musical numbers) and it was also very po faced about issues and story lines (I use this term very loosely as I don't think it really had any ongoing story. It just kept telling us how socially (Ir)relevant it was). Pitch Perfect has no such heavy issues on its mind. It's fun all the way to the closing credits. The choice of music is great and these numbers are energetically staged. Another delight is the banter between Capella hosts John and Gail played with acerbic relish by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, respectively. In summation, echoing a sentiment vocalised by actress Rebel Wilson to a couple of skinnier cast members, this film, like them, has a fat heart."" ]"
arbitrage;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""A second rate entertainment masquerading as an A list movie. Arbitrage is like a routine episode of a low grade tv drama series complete with an ineffectual detective here played by Tim Roth.

The abrupt ending just reinforces just how futile the whole enterprise is."" ]"
the-paperboy;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Watching the Paperboy is a bit like being an observer watching a car wreck. One is inappropriately fascinated by the whole thing. Lee Daniels direction is very uneven (although not without its moments of style), and he seems to subscribe to the notion that nothing succeeds like excess. It doesn't! The film is handicapped from the start by voiceover narration that alienates the viewer quickly rather than getting them involved. The grainy and amateurish photography is also at first a distraction, even though as the film progresses it does seem to fit perfectly with the increasingly steamy and violent setting. Where Daniels has succeeded most is with the performances of his cast. John Cusack is suitably nasty as the killer on death row; Zac Efron perfect as the pretty boy maturing by events surrounding him, and the currently ever improving Matthew McConaughey is just great as the newspaper reporter with a secret. Shining above all these, however, is Nicole Kidman in the role of the trashy Charlotte. She steals the film. Even by her own high standards this versatile and accomplished actress is truly amazing. If the Paperboy was judged soley on the performance Daniels has drawn from Miss Kidman it would certainly be no mean achievement."" ]"
hitchcock;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Comparisons with 'The Girl' are inevitable, but whilst this isn't as good, it certainly paints  in a rather better light. On the whole this is an entertaining and fairly lightweight concoction, performed to perfection. Anthony Hopkins is much better in the role of the famous director than I had been led to believe and Helen Mirren turns in her usual high calibre performance as his wife Alma Reville, the backbone behind the man. The main fun with the film is watching well known actors play other well known personalities. Aside from the two leads, Scarlett Johannson registers well as Janet Leigh, and in a very small role James D'arcy absolutely nails Anthony Perkins displaying all that actors nervous tics and hesitancy. His is a performance I would like to have seen more of. Recreations of the making of Psycho are great and the film generally entertains without displaying any of the heavy drama that made 'The Girl' so compelling. There are merits to each film and both present  in a slightly different way. The truth is probably somewhere in between."" ]"
zero-dark-thirty;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""When Kathryn Bigelow went on American TV recently to address the controversy that had built up concerning the torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, her main defence for the film was that it is a movie and not a documentary. This statement is fair enough in itself, but a movie is first meant to be entertainment and other considerations are secondary. A documentary, on the other hand, is first factual and then hopefully also entertaining. Zero Dark Thirty is for the most part too complex to be easily understood from a historical point of view and, on the whole, to slow too be first rate entertainment. Even the last 30 minutes or so which shows the navy seals storming the suspected hideaway fortress of Bin Laden fails to be either as exciting or as informative as a recent documentary on the subject called ' Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill'. For me this documentary steals Bigelows thunder with its richly detailed reconstructions and dazzling insights into the whole operation. Zero Dark Thirty, unfortunately, never gets to cinematic grips with an unsatisfactory script that whilst not pandering to its audience, nevertheless treats them with contempt by leaving out many more interesting and revelatory details than it puts in."" ]"
parker;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Parker is a very entertaining heist and revenge drama. Jason Statham is in his element here and this is his only other good film after 'The Bank Job'. Muscularly directed by Taylor Hackford and tightly edited the film is a guilty pleasure. Jennifer Lopez doesn't disgrace herself, although she is saddled with some of the worst of the dialogue, and events move at a cracking pace. The opening heist scene is good value and there is a corker of a scene involving a shower curtain, a knife and lashings of blood which is edge of seat stuff. The West Palm Beach locations are also breathtakingly unfamiliar."" ]"
life-of-pi;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Having read the book by Yann Martel and knowing that Ang Lee was at the helm, I was really looking forward to seeing Life of Pi. I thought the film would be visually stunning and an emotional roller coaster and truly expected it to be my film of the year 2012, an expectation encouraged by the brilliant trailer. Therefore, I was very disappointed to realise that the actual movie only partially delivered. The main problem is with the adaptation of the book which many people felt was un-filmable. The novel is good,  not great, but it does present the boy's willingness to embrace all religions in a very entertaining way, sometimes almost comically. The first half of the film meanders from scene to scene giving us no reason to invest in his religious beliefs. Another problem, having read the book, is that the sequence involving the four animals in the lifeboat has been excised from the screenplay to spare us their gory and prolonged deaths. Whilst I'm exceedingly grateful for this on the one hand, it does tend to dilute what the book did so well in showing the true horror of survival. On the positive side the film has a great asset in its young actor, Suraj Sharma, and its visual effects. The storm sequences are the best in the film and Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger, is a great creation. The cinematography too is, on occasion, quite beautiful. However, I am less sure about the 3D. It may have something to do with the cinema in which I saw the film, or just be due to the print under review, but I was constantly aware of a blurring of images on the periphery of scenes. This was not only annoying, but distracting. I had to check my glasses on numerous occasions and it became an issue as the film progressed. Overall Ang Lee does make a good stab at parts of the story, including a couple of emotional moments and when the boy and tiger are alone on the open sea, but it is a case of stabbing rather than sleight of hand."" ]"
oz-the-great-and-powerful;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Excessive length kills an already verbally challenged storyline. I must confess to not being a huge fan of the land of Oz. There is no denying the classic status of 1939's 'The Wizard of Oz', but recent theatrical productions have either been truly awful (Wicked) or overly familiar ('Wizard of Oz). This Oz fares no better. James Franco is charismatic as the fake wizard injecting both humour and a liveliness into the proceedings, but the film runs out of steam long before the second half. Compensations are to be had with the aesthetics of the film. Costumes, Art-Direction, Visual effects and Make-up are all truly amazing and the film looks the millions of dollars that it probably cost to make. It is probably the best looking film of the year so far. However, it is probably the worst scripted also, and where film making is concerned it is always better to have a good story to get involved with than a visual feast. Both in sync is the ideal. This Oz is basically a boring, but beautiful series of pictures."" ]"

Tye Sheridan is a natural as the boy and Matthew McConaughey must now rank as one of the top 5 American actors in movies today. His performances of late (Killer Joe; Magic Mike; Dallas Buyers Club) Just keep stretching him and he continues to get better and better. The film is so lovingly photographed that you begin to feel the environment. Directed with restraint by original author Jeff Nicholls it is spot on tonally in eliciting pathos. Only some mis judged music at the end rudely spoils the effect of this other wise quite brilliant little gem."" ]"
oblivion;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""The first blockbuster out of the gate is for the most part an engaging sci-fi thriller. An obliterated New York looks great! Photographed and lit superbly, for the most part in muted colour tones, the resultant effect works extremely well. In fact, the film intrigues right up until the true identity of the scavengers is revealed. From here on a lack of clarity in the script, self indulgence in the direction and a surplus of endings that becomes tiresome dilutes the overall effect. The final twist is just one unbelievable plot point too far, given the context of what's gone before. Cruise and, especially, Andrea Riseborough make an effective team. Melissa Leo is again just fab in another of her small, but effective, supporting turns and it is only Morgan Freeman who doesn't bring anymore than his obvious stature to the role. Also, although it is not his fault, it is precisely on his entry that the film begins to implode. Still, if the other blockbusters are half as imaginative and entertaining as this one we will indeed be fortunate."" ]"

There are indeed some laughs to be had but the comedy is totally uneven, as is the story, and ranges from laugh out loud funny to lame, predictable and offensive. There is also a reliance on profanity and coarseness which is tiresomely juvenile. Sandra Bullock works hard, but Melissa McCarthy is beyond the pale with her all too familiar antics again on display. Her character is awful and she is awful. Still, at least she is consistent in her characterisations being despicable and unsavoury in everything in which she appears."" ]"

Not as good as its predecessors, Midnight is so talky that one wishes at times that someone would take a breath. Basically consisting of five major scenes, the airport and car journey sequences see the film off to a promising start only to have it falter in the next, a dinner, which is without question the worst part of the film. Negative reaction sets in here due to bad supporting actors and irritating writing which, whilst trying to be profound one moment and frivolous the next, is just annoying. The heart of the film takes place in a hotel room where disappointments, criticism and recriminations come to the fore. It is in this approximately 40 minute sequence that the film really comes alive demonstrating that despite all attempts to the contrary long term relationships do become jaded and always need to be worked on. Delpy and, especially, Hawke excel here. They inhabit their characters like a second skin and Midnight rises to the expected level which the first hour fails to attain."" ]"

Testimonies lovingly articulated by family and friends bear out that their six year relationship really was one that most people would aspire to. Events following the accident appallingly demonstrate how cruel and selfish the actions can be by the people who purport  to love us the most, our parents!"", """", ""The film is a tear jerker of the first order and so the overly saccharine incidental music that creeps in from time to time isn't necessary as all the emotions are right up there on the screen.

This is not to dismiss it out of hand as I believe it to be a better film than most critics have suggested. The colour palette of the photography is very striking as is the art-direction. Performances are fantastic. In a role that is totally suited to him, Gosling is once again a commanding presence even with minimal dialogue. Kristin Scott Thomas excitingly cast against type is just a knockout.

For the first time I have taken note of Rooney Mara and I honestly don't think Keith Carradine and Ben Foster have ever been better. The star of this film ,however, is the lyrical writing which the actors bring to life exquisitely. The combination of the two makes many scenes totally hypnotic. There is also a pervading sense of  tragedy throughout which is underlined by the perfect and appropriately mournful score. The abrupt ending slightly disappoints but this is actually due more  to  my expectation  than to do with the story not concluding. It could have gone on but that is another story and in effect would make this a different film."" ]"
the-conjuring;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The Conjuring promises more than it ultimately delivers, although an effective sense of trepidation is felt throughout. The film is actually at its best in the first hour before all the camera equipment is moved into the house to photograph unfolding events. Maximum tension is eked out of scene after scene and although these occasionally result in some chilling payoffs they are never to jumpy effect. Great camera movements, considered direction and the main house setting create the right atmosphere and all add to the film's success. Likewise, the music and sound effectively jangle the nerves. It is therefore a shame that towards the end things start to get a tad silly. Unintentional laughs are conjured up when Lili Taylor goes in to full possession and we find ourselves in territory derivative from other movies. This, unfortunately, has the effect of undermining some of the good work achieved during the film's careful build up."" ]"

In fact, she hasn't been this good in years and looks fantastic into the bargain."", ""Unfortunately, with the entry of a rather mis-cast and de glamourised Julianne Moore the film rather deflates. It's obvious that she and Levitt will get together, but this last act which is a shade unbelievable loses the laughs, becomes rather moralising, somewhat judgemental and is actually too simplistically concluded. All of which is a shame because there is so much to enjoy in the film's first hour."", ""Amongst its other achievements the movie boasts a great original score.

There are simply not enough superlatives to praise Blanchett's playing of this wonderfully multi dimensional and complex woman. The last time I can remember seeing such a delightful and off beat female character on screen was way back in 1987 when Holly Hunter presented us with her controlling TV producer Jane Craig in Broadcast News. Another performance to relish. Whether popping pills, talking to herself or rejecting suitors Cate is joyous whilst looking absolutely fantastic into the bargain."", """", ""In all honesty Allen's screenplay, whilst dramatically very good, is not particularly funny. The comedy is elicited by Blanchett's delicate playing and her expressions from scene to scene. Her escape from the clutches of the amorous dentist has to be seen to be appreciated and she makes it laugh out loud funny. There are no two ways about it she steals the show. Sally Hawkins does well in her role as the sister and of the men Andrew Dice Clay registers the best as Hawkins' ex-husband. But it is Cate all the way.

Therefore, it is rather disappointing to report that following this excellent opening we are treated to a film whose first half is so dull and dreary that boredom settles in very quickly. It is definitely not the equal of any of TLOTR films. A perfunctory battle scene and the introduction of the charmless dwarfs do little to up the ante. In fact the real star of the first half of this film is actually the New Zealand scenery and we are treated to quite a lot of it as our intrepid travellers climb up mountain, after mountain, after (yawn yawn) mountain!"", """", ""Still, it's not all bad news as the second half improves considerably.

She plays a single mother who finds love with an escaped convict who holds both her and her teenage son hostage in their own home. Josh Brolin is good as the convict but pitted against Winslet he is some what eclipsed. Flashbacks provide us with the back ground to both these characters and allow us to understand why they are in their current situations, but the movie is best when following the thrust of the main narrative. These flashbacks are, in fact, the least successful aspect of the film being only of sporadic interest. Brolin's past is signposted a mile off and Winslet's isn't particularly revealing."", ""The film does have a nice gentle tone to it which leads to an expected and inevitable conclusion.

The dual backgrounds of life on a decaying earth about 41 years in the future and the alternative safety and opulence enjoyed by the very rich on Elysium is so perfectly balanced that one is completely engrossed in the whole rather than being interested in only half the film. Matt Damon, following on from Bourne, continues to be a good investment as an action hero and Jodie Foster, with an intriguing accent, is fascinating as Elysium's gatekeeper. There are also some wonderful visual compositions and the special effects are sometimes stunning. On the evidence here one can understand why people would want to live on Elysium. The film remains on a constant level throughout due to rapid fire editing and music that adds volumes in creating the gamut of emotions that run through the film. It is fair to say that this is a more conventional movie than Neill Blomkamp's previous one, District 9, but is is also more digestible."" ]"

The writing is so wonderful that at times it feels almost poetic and the actors articulate every word to perfection.

In the lead role as Solomon, kidnapped from his home and sold into slavery for 12 years, Chiwetel Ejiofor conveys with frustration and anger the injustice of the situation in which he finds himself. It is a subtle and impressive performance which culminates in a well earned emotional pay of when he and his family are finally re-united.

The story becomes more unbelievable as it progresses, silly even, and the last scenes are very unsatisfactory. Finally, I was left  questioning exactly what had transpired.

Jim Broadbent and (especially) Lindsay Duncan are utterly convincing as a jaded married couple returning to Paris to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.

I defy anyone who has been married as long as this couple not to recognise themselves in at least some aspects of the fine writing. The compromises, broken dreams, regrets, recriminations, disappointments, triumphs and failures all come under accurate scrutiny and the performers add the nuances that makes the whole thing ring with the sting of truth. This doesn't mean, however, that there aren't some bizarre and unlikely interludes. I really don't think your average 50 year old is going to attempt to do a runner from a restaurant, but these are forgivable and still enjoyable moments in an intelligent, if at times, rather sad tale."", """", ""As an aside, and almost by default, the film highlights how travel and weekend breaks (specifically here) can be fraught and stressful, in contradiction to the fun they are meant to be.

On the one hand one admires some original conceits only to dismiss their unbelievable conclusions within the soft centred predictability of the story's arc.

In addition I had more fun watching the computer games in the film than I did from the film itself."", """", ""Joaquin Phoenix is as good as always and Scarlett Johansson is engaging, for a while, as operating system Samantha, but even she wears thin by the end.

Dig deeper, though, and ths is actually not as original as its surface sheen would have us believe. It's just another boy meets girl, by loses girl, boy meets different girl.

It's definitely not just another popcorn movie but is a very accomplished piece of film making in its own right. The setting and costumes continue to be very imaginative. It has a good story enhanced by tight editing keeping the whole thing extremely tense and compelling, and the effects are special. It has to be said that Jennifer Lawrence is turning out to be a great asset for the series and after this one I'm now anticipating the third with some eagerness."" ]"
the-double-2013;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The Double is consistently fascinating enough not to be considered a bad film, but is also too frustratingly opaque to be a really good one. Set in a dark futuristic society the film reminded me of both Gilliam's 'Brazil' and Polanski's 'The Tenant'. It is a small ambitious film, Orwellian in tone, in which the production achievements belie its low budget. The cinematography is amazing in depicting atmosphere which in turn compliments the claustrophobically dark sets. The music also perfectly judges the film's mood. Jesse Eisenberg, possibly envying Armie Hammer's dual role in 'The Social Network', now finds himself with a doppelganger all his own, albeit not a twin. He gives a committed performance which is actually quite mesmerising to behold. He is well supported by Mia Wasikowski (who is a lot better than usual)  and an assortment of character actors in very small parts only some of whom are recognisable. I particularly liked Paddy Considine, and it's also good to see Cathy Moriarty again. Director Richard Ayoade adds the occasional eye catching visual flourish and some of the writing is very good, but as a whole the script is as uneven as the film is obscure. Ultimately it fails to be as good as it could have been because one is left somewhat perplexed by it all."" ]"

The young cast are convincingly energetic and Kate Winslet lends her well earned stature to a baddie role even if it is a somewhat unusual choice for the Oscar winner. The plot at times does strain credibility even for this genre and the inevitable blossoming romance between Woodley and James is more of the same. However, for such a long film it is consistently entertaining and for the most part it all works very nicely. Only towards the end do events veer towards extreme conventionality, but by this time one has enjoyed it too much to carp. I think the film critics saw a different movie."" ]"

In fact this Marvel-less movie is a thorough going bore. Aside from a few sequences (involving a lift, and a climatic fight aboard an artillery carrier) most of the action is un excitingly derivative. In between these set pieces we have a lot of waffle spoken in an attempt to build character, but this only extends the agony of an already over long film.

Inside the house are various pets as well as toys that randomly and magically spring to life. The early scenes keep one enthralled and entertained, but by the end the movie is struggling.

hercules;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It all starts so promisingly with remembered stories of some of the famed labours of our eponymous hero. However, after a quick introduction to the man god's background and a whiplash bout of special effects this settles into a training exercise for two rather un excitingly staged battles.

Things do liven up somewhat when the villains are unmasked and Hercules gets to perform his last labour.

calvary;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""There is a lot to like and admire in 'Calvary', not least a compelling opening demonstrating Brendan Gleeson's skill as an actor, and a strong ending with a powerful final moment.

There is no real narrative drive beyond its almost inevitable conclusion. Gleeson is superb as the very human priest under threat of being murdered by a member of his own community. Living with this knowledge and battling his own demons he still carries on with the day to day effort of positively influencing the disparate bunch of characters he encounters on a daily basis. The screenplay, which takes place over the course of a week, examines the differing views on the church; from its hypocrisies, the cynicism of the non believers, to the almost obsessive nature of the converted. It is all served up with a delicious dose of black humour (I love the line ' Friends are enemies you've not made yet') which successfully makes its points without trivialising the serious nature of the film generally."", ""It certainly holds the attention and can also boast a fine supporting cast from which Chris O'Dowd stands out as the local butcher."" ]"

maleficent;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Based on 'The Sleeping Beauty', my favourite of the old style animated Disney Films, this is a credible and mainly satisfying re-imagining of that film's iconic villainess. This version benefits from a refreshing twist in the story's telling and an inspired casting choice in Angelina Jolie to play the malevolent titular character. Eschewing the campy humour that essentially ruined 'Mirror Mirror' and balancing its dark tone much more successfully than 'Snow White and the Huntsman', this latest fairy tale adaptation hits most of the right notes. The film looks great and the visual effects can take their place amongst the year's best. James Newton Howard's score never pauses for breath, but delivers everything that we have come to expect of his lush and sweepingly epic music. Also the narration that accompanies the story is strong and complimentary to the overall style. It's only really the temptation to resort to cutesy humour, as when the three tiny fairies become peasant women, that threatens to topple the film in to the realms of pantomime.

Watching them play the cat and mouse games afforded them by the serpentine twists and turns of a very impressive screenplay makes for enthralling viewing. Director Hussein Amir keeps his camera in close creating an edgy claustrophobic atmosphere, whilst not allowing the gorgeous Greek and Turkish locations to distract from the main drama.

Fine actors John Lithgow and Alfred Molina provide some lovely moments, but in all honesty both have been better. This is rather surprising considering the possibilities these roles afforded them. They come across as just to knowing. Only Marisa Tomei really impresses in what could have amounted to a nothing mother role.

He is usually good, sometimes brilliant, and here what emotion there is he elicits effortlessly in two or three beautiful moments.

However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll."", ""The recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly."", ""Criticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing’s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent ‘Foxcatcher’ are also helpful and informative."", ""Ultimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing’s one time fiancé, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch."", ""Rarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat."" ]"

It's an ambitious but flawed venture that is big in concept, big in budget and explores  big themes. Sadly what this all adds up to is a big disappointment. The story, full of as many holes as there are black ones in space, is a mish mash of ideas which never really gel and one never quite gets a hold of what the point of it all is. The actors don't offer much by way of compensation either. Anne Hathaway shouldering the worst of the dialogue is the biggest casualty here, but Michael Caine is also tiresome as is Matt Damon who adds nothing. Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain. The film's biggest asset is her performance, although it's good to see film legend Ellen Burstyn showing all the others how it's done in just one tiny scene."", """", ""The banal dialogue is often gibberish and causes the rolling of one's eyes in disbelief or embarrassment. Nearly all scenes are over extended and often one is inclined to tune out long before they are finished. The special effects are good, but aside from a couple of sequences (a huge wave and the final set piece involving McConnaughey and Chastain),there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The music comes on strong and sounds like an extended version of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' from 1973's 'The Exorcist', co incidentally starring Burstyn in one of her finest roles."", """", ""The sound is very loud and effective during the set pieces, but is then often inaudible during simple dialogue exchanges between characters.

I would have recommended the removal of his power pack."", """", ""Director Christopher Nolan is certainly full of ideas but, unfortunately, they are never fully realised. He comes over like a young boy trying to communicate a passion or a hobby that no one else gets. His direction is over indulgent and left me confused and bored.

boyhood;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Richard Liknlater's unique experimental film about one boy's evolution into adulthood is a long but engaging coming of age story. Shot over a period of 12 years, and calling on the same cast each time, it is a risky enterprise that could have failed in numerous ways. To Linklater's good fortune his cast are uniformly excellent. As the boy under scrutiny Ellar Coltrane acts naturally and even though the story and his character, Mason, are fictional there is a sense that one is watching the real person evolve. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette (so this is where she's been) are totally convincing as the parents 'winging it'. Arquette's rant 'I thought there would be more!' probably mirrors the reactions of audiences who will not warm to the film's general lack of outlandish drama and sudden time switches. Others, like myself, will find these subtle transitions make the picture feel fluid."", """", ""Despite seeming a long watch I don't know where any cuts could reasonably be made to make it more manageable, even though a lot more time is given over to Mason's later teenage years when he is dating and contemplating college. The screenplay, whilst lacking a lot of dramatic incident, has a lot of social/political points to make and Mason becomes the mouthpiece for many of these. At times one gets the impression that what he is saying really represents another, more mature, person's views. However, the writing is intelligent and people of all ages will be able to recognise situations and identify or empathise with the characters experiencing them."", """", ""After his enduring 'Before' series Richard Linklater has done it again in producing a film that, whilst it may not be the masterpiece exalted by the critics, is never the less a unique and ground breaking evocation of one ordinary boy's journey through childhood."" ]"
futuro-beach;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""A long and slow exercise in tedium, this gay themed film is divided into three chapter headings and set between the differing cultures of Brazil and Germany. The slight story, which had the potential to be so much more never uses dialogue when a visual will do. This is in no way meant as a compliment to the cinematography which is actually just journeyman work. Rather the film is full of so called ‘evocative’ imagery much of which is just pointlessly extended at the expense of anyone actually saying anything. There are endless shots of nothing in particular like the sea, wind turbines, a plane in the sky, seagulls hovering, people walking, people staring, people bonking. Get the picture? Good, because the picture is all you get from this ambiguous and often irritating angst ridden drama. Occasionally a scene threatens to become interesting (chapter 3 promises the most) but before you know it we are back to the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. The gay market is catered for with much shirt less ness and sex, but anyone expecting any kind of relationship to be explored meaningfully are watching the wrong movie. The leads also lack charisma, so by the time the unsatisfyingly ambiguous ending finally arrives, any discerning audience member will already be contemplating what they are going to do next."" ]"

Set in 1981 a year, apparently, where more crime was committed in New York City than at any other time, it is an intelligently written drama that is both thrilling and dazzlingly acted. Oscar Isaac is fast becoming the most exciting and versatile actor currently on screen and I’m sure that other people have noticed the similarities he bears to Al Pacino. He would certainly have been a great actor to have had around in the 70’s, still the most exciting decade for films. Likewise Jessica Chastain, still flying under the radar despite 2 Oscar nominations and countless films to her credit, is at her powerful best here. She may not have as much screen time as Isaac, but she makes every second count in her bid to be ‘deadlier than the male’. Bleak cinematography, low key music and unobtrusive, but firm, direction from J C Chandor contribute to a film of deceptively raw power. A welcome throwback and proof that they do make them like this ‘anymore’."" ]"
wild-tales;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""This collection of six short stories is generally very entertaining but stops short of being truly great due to a couple of the longer instalments (number 4 and 5) over indulging their content. The first 2 stories are really short. The first set on a plane is frighteningly topical, unintentionally echoing events surrounding the recent tragedy in the French Alps. All the tales are about revenge of some sort or another and whilst the film is not often laugh out loud funny there is definitely a rich vein of black humour coursing through its veins. The best of the episodes involves two drivers who get caught up in violence and death following a road rage encounter. This story is very humorous and yet contains a lot of tension. It is undoubtedly the highlight. The last tale concerns a bride and groom who come to blows at their own wedding reception. This episode is also very successful at combining drama with black comedy and despite the story’s arc, which could have come over as really contrived, the episode works marvellously. There is a great use of music throughout and were it not for the over indulgent ‘Falling Down’ sequence and the least entertaining ‘Hit and Run’ episode, these original tales would be worth an 8 of anyone’s ratings."" ]"

Following on from his excellent performances in films like ‘The Hunt and ‘A Royal affair’, as well as his TV outing in ‘Hannibal, Mads Mikkelesen proves once again that he is a commanding presence on screen and an actor one looks forward to watching. High production values across the board and a stunning South African location also make the film both aurally and aesthetically pleasing. However, it must be said that the cinematography is the star of the show. With its vibrant use of colour and the almost surreal beauty of its night time shots the film belies a probable small budget and looks better than most blockbusters ever could. This is a real gem that will reward those who seek out its treasure. Small, maybe, but perfectly formed."" ]"
a-little-chaos;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Initially A Little Chaos bears comparison to a new and unused jewellery box in that it is pretty but empty. As things progress, however, one’s interest is stimulated by a couple of well-played scenes and a dedicated performance from Kate Winslet. She can do a role like this as if it was a walk in the park, or as is the case here, a walk in the garden. Her dialogues with Alan Rickman in particular have a real spark and are quite hypnotic to behold, successfully drawing one into what has hither to been a rather unengaging period piece. The film is generally overly talky rather than literate and the period setting is an unnecessary expense even if the costumes are beautiful in themselves. This is a tale that could easily have been told in a modern setting. At its heart it is basically a romance between Winslet and Matthias Schoenerts who is, unfortunately, not seen to best advantage here costumed and bewigged. He seems uncomfortable in the period setting and his performance lacks the dimension he brought to his role in ‘Suite Francaise’. On the other hand Alan Rickman, as the sun king Louis X1V, is a better actor here than he is a director. Scenes are often lengthy and over indulgent and the film seems to have ambitions above, what is essentially, a small romantic storyline. Supporting performers add colour, although Stanley Tucci is in danger of being typecast as campy and effeminate. Here, as the King’s bi-sexual brother, he makes meals out of witty throwaways. Thankfully, he can be seen at the moment to better advantage in TV’s ‘Fortitude’. Overall the film is disappointing rather than bad, but does afford some pleasures for anyone seeking out fairly light and undemanding entertainment."" ]"
fifty-shades-of-grey;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Arriving as a target to face a probable onslaught of negative reviews from cynical and jaded critics, I decided to view this media juggernaut before passing judgement myself. Not having read the book, and having absolutely no desire to do so, I was still curious as to what the story was aside from containing the odd kinky sex scene. The good news is that whilst it may be a bit of fluff, it’s slick and oddly intriguing fluff that contains two impressive performances, top notch production values and beautiful music that perfectly underscores the drama."", ""The aforementioned sexual content has had critics using the words ‘bland’ and ‘vanilla’ whereas, in fact, for a mainstream commercial film these scenes are actually quite strong. They have been very well integrated into the story and first rate choreography and editing have maximised their effect. Let’s face it this is fluff, not porn, and so this was never going to be ‘Deep Throat’ or ‘Debbie Does Dallas’ and I for one am extremely thankful for it. Also, strangely for a film that is aimed primarily at women, as I’m sure the book was, it has the potential to also alienate many of that gender. I’m sure not all women will be appreciative of Christian Grey’s very singular sexual proclivities."", ""Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have great chemistry together and Johnson in particular is an actress to watch. Dornan certainly looks the part, but his performance is is better in the TV series ‘The Fall’. It’s also good to see Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden in support, albeit in thankless mother roles. Still, this is undoubtedly Johnson and Dornan’s dance and the two leads make the material work."", ""The film also benefits by not taking itself too seriously. Dornan, in particular, seems to be playing Grey with his tongue very firmly in his cheek. One scene in which the two characters partake of a formal Business meeting is very amusingly played out. On the other hand an early bar scene showing a drunk Johnson being rescued by Grey represents the film at its worst."", ""If the film ultimately outstays its welcome it nevertheless has exceeded expectations. It may not be highbrow entertainment, but it’s certainly not torture."" ]"
love-mercy;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A refreshingly unfamiliar bio-pic which isn’t one of those conventional rags to riches stories so beloved of the genre, but which artistically are more often than not seen it all before pedestrian. This is a riveting, astoundingly well-acted drama concerning the mental illness afflicting The Beach Boys’ singer composer Brian Wilson, a story of which I knew absolutely nothing."", ""The original screenplay splits its running time between the younger Brian, struggling with group responsibilities as his grip on reality loosens, and the older one who is now a physical and emotional wreck in the care of people who really don’t care about him at all."", ""Director Bill Pohlad’s direction is lean and imaginative and through his actors unfolds a compelling story. As the girl who falls for and reaches out to Brian, Elizabeth Banks does some beautifully subtle and understated work conveying much without saying a word, particularly in her powerful scenes with Paul Giamatti as Brian’s unscrupulous therapist. Giamatti himself at first glance seems to be saddled with a clichéd cypher of a role, but the actor’s proven talent brings to the fore a true monster. Dano who is great at playing edgy or slightly off centre characters is in his element here as the younger Brian starting to lose control, but, amazingly, the real revelation is John Cusack as the older incarnation of the troubled singer/ composer. Cusack has often been an actor whose performances have tended to lack colour and shading, journeyman at best. Here, however, he is so much more. In a touching and compelling bit of acting he holds you spellbound whenever he is on screen."", ""The Beach Boys music permeates the film, but the story does not serve as its slave. Also, unusually, there are not any substantial concert scenes of which to speak. These are often perfunctorily thrown in when dealing with singers or groups and it is to the credit of the story that this gimmicky device was not deemed necessary in this particular instance. Period detail, most notably the costumes worn by Banks, is excellent and the sound is great. One of the best films of the year, thankfully, comes out in a summer when the season thus far has proved to be depressingly sillier than usual."" ]"
american-sniper;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Clint Eastwood applies his typical macho style to this superficially entertaining but cliché ridden war drama. Think of an inferior ‘Hurt Locker and substitute a beefed up Bradley Cooper in place of the slighter built Jeremy Renner. The film’s biggest liability is the screenplay which doesn’t have an original idea through its entire running time. As usual we have to endure the obligatory scenes of boys being boys and their irritating training routines. We watch dispassionately as Cooper’s marriage to Sienna Miller begins to combust as the war and his job as a sniper take their toll. We roll our eyes in disbelief at scenes where Cooper partakes of personal phone calls to Miller whilst at work in the war zone (Would that really be allowed to happen?). The end credits inform us that this is a true story and that the protagonist, Chris Kyle, was killed by a war veteran he was trying to help. Arrogantly, though, we are not privy to any further helpful information like why and how! It’s as if Director Eastwood feels that everyone will have heard of Kyle and know his story. That maybe so in America, but unfortunately does not apply to the rest of the world."", ""On the plus side the film is at least never boring and is actually very well edited. Cooper is very good and Miller, despite being saddled with some truly awful dialogue and the worst written scenes (her first introduction at the bar not withstanding), also acquits herself with dignity. The Oscar nominated sound is undeserving of the laurel, and one scene in which Cooper plays around with a gun in the family home struck me as being dangerously irresponsible in a film which has undoubted commercial appeal."" ]"
the-wolfpack;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A sobering documentary about a family of seven children (6 boys and 1 girl) who are for the most part confined to their New York apartment by their father in order to protect them from the social horrors of the outside world. The film concentrates almost entirely on the six boys who spend a lot of their time watching movies and then enacting them. Educated at home by their mother, who is also their rock and to whom each bears a great love, they are surprisingly well dressed, articulate and speak intelligently of their years of confinement. As the story unfolds their dislike of their father, and the regime that he has inflicted upon them, becomes apparent. Each boy, although obviously internally damaged, demonstrates an optimistic attitude and promise for the future. Their mother’s heart- breaking recollection of dreams never realised due to lack of funds, contributes to a very sad, but definitely not depressing tale. The father’s reason for his actions can be viewed as a paradox. There is much truth in the fact that the outside world is a scary and dangerous place. However, the damage inflicted on the children as a result of their alternate sheltered and confined existence leaves its own scars. Ultimately, despite the uncertainties evident in life, one has to be given the chance and freedom to find one’s own way. The film leaves you feeling optimistic that the boys’, against all the odds, will do just that."" ]"
southpaw-2015;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""Southpaw is the title, but very poor is the verdict of this seen it all before boxing movie which is an over long bore. Harvey Weinstein has gone on record as saying that this is the movie that will win Star Jake Gyllenhaal an Oscar. However, Gyllenhaal is so badly let down by a dire script that hangs out every cliché known to the boxing movie genre, that I don’t believe any self- respecting Academy member would allow that to happen. In truth Gyllenhaal is fine, and definitely the best thing about the overwrought melodrama that this is, but his performance is no classic in the making. The film is essentially a paint by numbers exercise where the direction is uneven at best and laboured at worst. Director Antoine Fuqua (now there’s a name to conjure with) prolongs almost every scene beyond endurance. The first half an hour is a lot of talk and the film only starts to get to grips with a semblance of a storyline following a fatal shooting. From here on in cliché follows cliché as the film tries to out- do ‘Rocky’ with no success. Basically this is about a boxer falling from the top to the bottom, losing his daughter along the way and doing everything to get both her and his successful boxing career back to the original status quo. The awful script is manipulative and there are many emotional moments for anyone buying into this predictable rubbish. The scenes with the daughter are squirm inducing, especially the one in which she keeps slapping her father for letting her down. Even the climatic fight is drained of any tension as one knows the outcome due to the obvious nature of the film. Subtlety surprise or originality are nowhere to be found here. The editing also misses a trick and it is rare for a fight scene to be so singularly lacking any tension or power. Overall this is film making at its worst. Commercial, unoriginal and just plain dull."" ]"

xenia;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It’s a long and uneven road for this amiable but insubstantial story about two brothers journeying through Greece to find the father who abandoned them as infants. Motivated in his quest by the death of his mother, the younger boy Dany (Kostas Nikouli) has his own emotional problems which prevent him from making the necessary transition from child to adult, despite his otherwise confident air as a young gay man. The film explores these insecurities through his pet rabbit Dido and some well delineated fantasy sequences, some of which involve a larger than life stuffed rabbit. The film also tips its hat to Eurovision and the older brother Odysseas (Nikos Gelia) is presented as a really good singer looking to enter a popular talent contest en-route. One particular episode, no doubt aimed at the gay market, shows the brothers singing and dancing in their underwear. This sequence of high camp is too meticulously choreographed to integrate believably here despite the flamboyance of the lead character or the fun it otherwise produces. Political issues, such as the financial crisis in Greece and the immigration problem are also convincingly touched upon. Ultimately, the film is not unlikeable, but it is seriously overlong by at least half an hour for its slim storyline. The climatic meeting with the father is actually very good and creates some tension, as is an earlier meeting with bullies. This sequence results in one of the attackers being shot with the gun that Dany misguidedly carries around with him. The lovely musical accompaniment, often played on acoustic guitar, is reminiscent of some themes from ‘Brokeback Mountain’."" ]"
trainwreck;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Even though it gets more serious in the not quite as good second half, Trainwreck is that rare bird, a comedy that is actually very funny. Wearing the hats of writer and lead actress, Amy Schumer is great in both guises. Her screenplay is outrageously raunchy at times and surprisingly tender at others. It offers up the opportunities for some wonderful supporting cameos from the likes of Ezra Miller, John Cena and especially Tilda Swinton. Unrecognizable beneath her very convincing make up Swinton steals every scene she is in as Schumer’s viperish boss and is is an absolute hoot! Schumer herself has great comic timing and carries the character confidently and convincingly to the only really conventional thing about the movie, the ending. One is prepared to forgive this, however, due to the copious amounts of goodwill generated en-route by an almost consistently funny movie."" ]"
minions;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A Hodge podge of ideas are never successfully converted into a totally successful story and this ‘Despicable Me’ offshoot can really only be recommended to Minion fans. The animation is very good and the soundtrack is wonderfully interjected with some classic 60’s songs. Also for the adult movie buffs in the audience there are plenty of references to other films one of which, if I’m not mistaken, is a homage to ‘The creature from the Black Lagoon’? The villain here voiced by Sandra Bullock is the aptly titled Scarlet Overkill. However, the character lacks the sinister villainy of Despicable Me’s ‘Gru’. I don’t wish to be too harsh on the film because there are some truly inspired moments. The early narrated scenes depicting the Minions in search of the greatest villain they can find is a lot of fun as are the scenes at the Tower of London. Unfortunately, though, not being a true Minion convert I watched proceedings rather impassively laughing at only a couple of inspired sight gags. Ultimately, one is left to conclude that this is a film for children or diehard fans only."" ]"

Emerging somewhat damaged from a dysfunctional working class background and optimistically declaring that she was ‘not a messed up person, Amy’s vulnerability, shyness and penchant for cutting remarks tell an altogether different story."", ""The influences of both her husband and father, Blake Fielder and Mitch Winehouse respectively, are here clearly depicted as self-serving negative forces in her life. The former introduced her to the hard drugs that would assist her in pushing the self-destruct button, whilst the former was more concerned about his life style than the well- being of his troubled daughter."", ""Unusually this is not a documentary given over to talking heads. Instead we just hear the voices over filmed footage with titles informing us as to who is speaking and where the action is taking place. It makes for a refreshing change. Also, the brilliant decision to have the lyrics to her songs actually appear on screen as she is singing them adds volumes to our understanding of the singer, her demons and how she coped with them, albeit tragically."", ""Whilst the many unsavoury aspects of her life forces one to acknowledge that she could never be held up as a positive role model, her voice and talent were truly great.

The incomprehensible story basically revolves around the toxic friendship between Elisabeth Moss and Katharine Waterston. They appear to meet up every year at the latter’s secluded lake house to exchange barbs and vitriol, but all in the name of friendship. The tone of the film comes on like some British ‘B’ horror movie of the early seventies complete with heavy doom laden music, but in reality the only horror exuding from this mess is the unfortunate loss of 90 minutes of one’s life. The story negates any interest in the performances and both actresses spout monologues which are sleep inducing. One scene of breakdown actually reminded me of a similar scene in Polanski’s The Tenant, a much better film, however. If all this wasn’t bad enough, in addition the sound is appalling rendering many lines of dialogue, mercifully, inaudible. A total mess."" ]"

Adapted from a novel, his survival and NASA’s subsequent rescue mission makes up the bulk of the story. Incredulity is kept at bay due to an intelligently credible screenplay. Damon holds centre screen effortlessly, but performances are secondary to the visuals as presented by director Ridley Scott. Despite being rather long the film manages to constantly command attention and the last 20 minutes certainly rack the nerves. The writing is peppered with humour and the score is appropriately and memorably fitting. With regards to the 3D format, I don’t think it is essential here, but does the job unobtrusively."" ]"

Ok, so none of it is to be taken very seriously and basically it’s a load of old tosh. However, should one really be clock watching and yawning this much? Tom Cruise is a good action hero and by now the part fits him like a hand in a glove, but I am less impressed with Simon Pegg’s comic turn as his side kick.

Following on from his undisputed acclaim in TV’S ‘Breaking Bad’, he gives a credible account of what Trumbo, or at least his essence, could have been like for the many who wouldn’t have a clue who he was. Helen Mirren pops up as gossip columnist Hedda Hopper ably demonstrating the fun she is having with the role. Her Hopper comes over as instrumental in Trumbo’s downfall and Mirren plays her as evil personified. It’s also fun to see actors taking on the roles of famous faces of the day.

One tends to forgive a lot of the risible dialogue spouting from the mouth of a one dimensional Bryce Dallas Howard as soon as the exciting encounters with the hybrid Indominus Rex gets underway. In fact despite everything else that is wrong with this film there can be no question that the scenes involving the dinosaurs are on the money and trump anything the previous films achieved."", ""Chris Pratt, a good looking and charismatic lead, is not being used to best advantage in movies at the moment what with this and the abysmally over rated ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’. An unrecognizable Vincent D’Onofrio, carrying a few extra pounds, plays the obligatory bad guy without generating any spark of interest and Bryce Dallas Howard is just impossible. Her character is broadly played as if stupidity were an art form. She sets women’s roles back years, maybe even to the age of the dinosaur. It’s also amusing to ponder the continuity problems involving her shoes. High heels one moment.

The music is a bit derivative of other movies.  The quieter scenes are reminiscent of John Williams work for ‘The Towering Inferno’ and at its noisiest the score is just that, a lot of bombastic noise.

Low on thrills but high on blood and gore, including one particularly nasty murder, the film is let down by a pedestrian story and unexceptional acting."", ""The much trumpeted Tom Hiddleston will have to do a lot better than this if he wishes to become one of today’s greats, and the usually reliable Jessica Chastain just doesn’t seem physically compatible in her role. She was actually scarier in ‘A Most violent year’.  Mia Wasikowska fares marginally better but she doesn’t really have to do much more than turn up from scene to scene in another gorgeous frock."", ""Aside from the ravishing visuals in both costumes and Art-Direction, other pluses are a lush and melodic score and some impressive visual effects and make-up. Overall, though, this is a classic case of style over substance. Many scenes, especially those involving Jessica Chastain, come over as campy, eliciting many an unintentional laugh. At two hours, however, one isn’t laughing for long."" ]"
room-2015;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Emma Donoghue’s screen adaptation of her own book is superior in every way to the novel which was told in a style that would not be to everyone’s taste. The story of a young woman abducted of the street and kept prisoner in a garden shed for seven years, during which time she gives birth to a son now five, could have failed on so many levels. Therefore, it is great to report that director Lenny Abrahamson has done an incredible job in finding the perfect visual style with which to tell this potentially small and insular story. In the first half he resolutely refuses to be enslaved by the claustrophobic confines of the room itself keeping the camera up close a lot of the time on the faces of his actors, trusting in their ability to keep the viewer engaged. Precise editing and interesting camera angles also help the film achieve a seamless fluidity that one never dreamed could be possible from reading the book."", ""The actors are outstanding. Brie Larson makes her biggest impact ever as the mother prepared to sacrifice all for her son and, as the boy, Jacob Tremblay is just magnificent. That such a mature and natural performance has been achieved by one so young is truly astonishing. It is fair to say that in lesser hands the quality of the film would have been compromised without his level of performance. The success of the film ultimately hinges on the believability of the child and young Mr Tremblay delivers in spades. Joan Allen pops up as grandma adding fireworks to one scene in particular, but William H Macy is totally wasted. The film is on occasion genuinely moving without being overly manipulative, although the lovely score does play some part in this. It is easy to see how it won the audience award at Toronto as I’m sure most people who see it will love it."" ]"

Joel Edgerton is saddled with an irritating character and the film demands constant, but hard won, concentration to keep up with what is going on.

steve-jobs;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Set backstage at the time of three different product launches in as many years: -1984; 1988 and 1998, this overly literate take concerning events in the life of the iconic Steve Jobs suffers from a screenplay that seems too pleased with itself by half. Divided into three acts, encompassing each year stated, the film feels theatrical in its presentation right down to the fact that most of it does actually take place on, or around, a stage. After a while all the talk begins to feel like reading a book that lacks punctuation. For the first two acts the more it plays, the more it pays in diminishing returns. This is due to the constant and rapid verbosity which, because the corporate musings don’t always seem clear, has the unfortunate effect of causing one to tune in and out as the interest wanes. Things improve decidedly in act three. Here director, writer and actors find synergy in three stand out scenes, where some humanity comes to the fore after having been noticeably absent in acts 1 and 2.  As if the film is aware that it is a talk fest we are also often treated to scenes of the actors walking (and talking) down corridors."", ""If I have some issues with the script, which is also at times brilliant, there are no such reservations with the actors. Having appeared in two films this year (Macbeth is the other) in which his performance has been better than the movie itself, Michael Fassbender is a knockout. It matters not a jot that he doesn’t look like the real person, as his chameleon like ability to get under the skin of a character stands him in good stead. It is the essence he brings to the part that one feels. Kate Winslet is also fantastic in a larger role than anticipated. She appears de-glammed, human and without any affectations of a star.  She is again wonderful."", ""If ever a film could be considered mixed in its achievement it is this one. Disappointing it may well be, but by the end it does sort of win you over."" ]"
legend;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""There are two very good reasons to see and appreciate ‘Legend’ and they are both Tom Hardy. His dual performances as the Kray twins is nothing short of sensational and he is magnetic in both roles. Aided by some seamless camera trickery he often appears as both brothers in the same frame. Unlike Director Peter Medak’s ‘The Krays’, which came out in the early 90’s, this film concentrates first and foremost on the brothers themselves rather than building the story around their mother Violet. Here this is well and truly Hardy’s show and Violet is relegated to a very minor role in the story. Even the fine supporting cast are generally over shadowed by Hardy’s tour de force performance although Emily Browning, as Ronnie Kray’s mentally unstable wife Frances, impresses by effectively communicating her character’s fragility via understatement. She also serves as the movie’s narrator."", ""The film looks great with outstanding production design depicting the East End of London during the 60’s. Many hits of the period pep up the soundtrack sharing musical duties with a surprisingly melodic original score. Only the sound seems a tad off in the early stages, but this probably has more to do with the cockney accents of its cast rather than bad mixing by the sound department. As if to confirm this, after about half an hour one’s ears begin to attune to the dialect being spouted. There in after one is able to totally surrender to the film’s vice like grip."" ]"
the-danish-girl;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Tom Hooper’s highly anticipated ‘The Danish Girl’ was eventually greeted rather indifferently by the sniffy critics who ultimately only seemed to appreciate the lead performances. Hooper seems to have come in for a lot of critical wrath since winning an Oscar for his least enjoyable film, ‘The King’s Speech’, and both his subsequent movies ‘Les Miserables’, and now this seem to have as many detractors as fans. The former group leaves me head scratchingly perplexed at this negativity as both films are beautifully conceived and marvellously acted examples of what cinema is all about. ‘The Danish Girl’ is a fascinating and, despite its two hour length, a concisely told and emotionally complex true story about transgender pioneer Lili Erbe. The film is a gorgeous prestige production from the beautiful locations in Paris and Copenhagen, through its breath taking production and costume designs, right down to the top notch performances of the two leads. Fresh from his Oscar winning success last year in ‘The Theory of Everything’, Eddie Redmayne is again very good. However, it has to be said that he does somewhat over do the coyness of the emerging Lili and, even at this early stage in his career, certain mannerisms and gestures are becoming quite identifiable within his repertoire. It is also unfortunate for him that in both his Oscar winning role and now here he has been somewhat overshadowed by his leading ladies. Felicity Jones stole the show in ‘Theory’ and a revelatory Alicia Vikander almost single handedly rains on his parade here. She runs a gauntlet of emotions and is heartbreakingly compelling. She becomes the film’s focal point and its soul without unbalancing the drama. Hooper’s direction is assured and there is a brevity in the editing to keep the pace interesting without seeming to trivialise or rush the complex and important story being told. If all this isn’t enough to make you squeeze out the odd tear then Alexander Desplat’s beautiful score will complete the task."" ]"
creed;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""A late offshoot from the popular ‘Rocky’ series of the seventies and eighties. It has some nice touches in both the writing and directing departments, but otherwise it’s pretty much the tried and trusted formula from the better examples of the series. If you are not a fan then the lack of originality and the seen it all before feel won’t convert you. The screenplay draws from the perfunctory elements as before- the no one becoming someone; the training; the obligatory girlfriend; the rousing music and the climatic fight. It’s all here folks and if you like this sort of thing, then it’s the sort of thing you’ll like. Performances are adequate for the demands of the material, but none are Oscar worthy so don’t believe the hype. The climatic fight sequence packs more than a few punches and truly gets the adrenaline racing helped no end by some brilliant editing."" ]"

Like a lot of its ilk, the set up dazzles more than the conclusion, but at least it eschews treacly sentiment."", ""Kids will be happy with the cornucopia of animal characters and fast paced action, whilst adults will relish the ‘in’ jokes, movie references and amazing invention on display. The train ride to, and through, Zootropolis needs to be seen a few times to fully appreciate the sheer beauty and imagination of the place. The animated work here is sublime."", ""If ever a film had a signpost invisibly displayed for a sequel then this is it. With its various kingdoms and variety of animals already set up, there is ample room left for an in exhaustive amount of story possibilities. One just hopes that they will all end up being as good as this one which, whilst holding its own with the animated best, is more importantly an estimable film in its own right."" ]"
macbeth-2015;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""There’s nothing wrong with Macbeth that losing the Shakespeare wouldn’t put right. Whilst I appreciate that there are many who hold the Bard in reverential esteem, I personally am unable to include the acclaimed playwright’s medieval prose amongst my cultural delights. I think it’s fair to say that line for line a clear understanding of his work and specifically what is actually being said here, is questionable to say the least. If a modern film had its script spoken in such a flowery and oblique manner it would be accused of pretentiousness. Sure, one gets the gist of what’s going on, but from interpretation and study, not from this as a stand-alone movie. Clarity is never a strength with Shakespeare and this version doesn’t escape the inherent problem. Polanski’s 1971 take wasn’t great either, but it was simpler and overall more digestible as a film."", ""The writing aside, however, this Macbeth does have much to commend it including a raw vitality which is present in all other aspects of the production. The direction and editing are stridently confident and the film benefits enormously from the casting of its two leads. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard must be counted amongst the best actors to appear on screen in the last 10 years. Fassbender, in particular, commands attention and it is to his credit that one watches him intensely even though the dialogue he is spouting leaves one cold. His scenes with Cotillard are mesmerising, even if her Lady Macbeth is otherwise sketchily interpreted."", ""Production design and costumes are also just right, as is the cinematography which is the true star. The end battle scenes are just gorgeous to behold. I don’t mean to declare war on Shakespeare as his stories are basically sound. It’s just a shame about the way he told them. Unfortunately, it is in the particular style of the telling where this potentially good film struggles, unsuccessfully, to get out."" ]"

the-lady-in-the-van;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""‘When I write about this it will be about a lot of s***’, states Alex Jennings as playwright Alan Bennett during a particularly insightful moment in this dull adaptation of Bennett’s own play. Whilst I wouldn’t have particularly chosen to use the phrase myself, its inclusion is pertinently apt given the film’s surprising failure. As the saying goes if the cap, or in this instance the bag fits, wear it! Based on true events it lacks both drama and laughs. Maggie Smith can do this kind of role in her sleep. She is a wonderful actress and a great British institution, but there is nothing new in her characterisation here that she hasn’t done many times before. Alex Jennings actually gives the best performance, well two actually, in a dual role that sees him uncannily impersonating Bennett as both the person and the writer. Only in the film’s final act does an element of pathos creep in to stir the interest, but it’s far too late in the day to stave off one’s overall disappointment and apathy."" ]"
the-revenant-2015;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Leonardo DiCaprio suffers with grim determination in this long and brutal story of betrayal, survival and revenge. However, this very physically demanding performance does not wow as it should. The almost total lack of dialogue for the character results in viewer alienation and a lack of empathy. One watches the horrific events unfold, but with a dispassionate detachment and some distaste. Director Alejandro G Inarritu creates a wonderful atmosphere environmentally. The locations, beautiful but forbidding, are awesomely captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki whose work here is just stunning. The film is worth seeing for his achievement alone. Also many scenes have a visceral quality to them, none more so than the Indian and bear attacks which both happen within the first half an hour and are excitingly and shockingly staged. Visual effects for the bear are incredibly good. After this events meander from one bloody scene to the next leaving one somewhat anaesthetised to the grisliness of it all. Suspension of disbelief is also a requirement in accepting just how quickly DiCaprio is back on his feet after his mauling by the bear, let alone scaling mountains (one sequence shows him at the top of a mountain unable to walk; the next scene shows him drinking from the lake below!). In support, Tom Hardy also disappoints, but this is once again mainly due to a vocalisation of his character that is often unintelligible. As we all know DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar here, and there is no denying that he is a deserving recipient. It’s just a shame that he will be rewarded, as happens all too often by the conventional and short sighted Academy, for this performance over one of his previous more deserving roles."" ]"
a-bigger-splash;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""‘A Bigger Splash’ is a hypnotically stunning achievement. Stylistically and directorially very much in the same vein as Director Luca Guadagnino’s earlier and equally impressive ‘I am Love’. This new film also stars a gorgeously costumed Tilda Swinton as rock star Marianne Lane, currently on a getaway with boyfriend Paul (Matthias Schoenaarts) following a throat operation. Their idyll on a Sicilian island is shattered by the arrival of an old flame Harry (Ralph Fiennes) and his daughter Penelope (Dakota Johnson). Based on the 1969 film ‘Swimming Pool’, this is a film about writing, acting and style. There are no dramatic action set pieces. It’s just four people taking life easy in gorgeous surroundings and becoming ever more intertwined by the complications of their own lives and personas. Psychological and sexual tensions abound and looks and gestures keep you totally entranced as to where the boundaries end and when the breaking points will come. The playing of the cast is superb, especially Fiennes and Swinton. Despite the limiting device of having her character unable to speak for much of the film, Swinton nevertheless effortlessly conveys the required emotions through her facial expressions. Schoenaerts, and especially a flirtatiously seductive Johnson add volumes to the atmosphere and audience investment. They not only provide the eye candy but give the story its palpable sexual charge. Best of all though is Fiennes. Walking an acting tightrope as Harry, he nevertheless gives a carefully modulated performance which at first has one fearful that his character will be played way over the top. This initial reaction is very quickly quelled however, and with many very difficult scenes focused solely on him, Fiennes brings this brash and obnoxious character breathtakingly to life. It has to be amongst his finest work. The film itself is definitely worth seeking out. It deserves your time and money more than something like ‘Triple 9’ or ‘Batman vs Superman’ ever could."" ]"
the-jungle-book-2016;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""From its wonderful opening as the camera draws back from the Disney logo into the magical Los Angeles created Jungle, one has a positive feeling that the film is going to be something special. It doesn’t disappoint. In fact, it is actually a lot better film, story wise, than the mythically lauded 1967 animated cartoon version which is remembered more due to the strength of its musical numbers. Director Jon Favreau has done a fantastic job here in creating both a visual treat, keeping things fast paced and snappy in the set pieces, as well as honing in on all the major characters and keeping them in sharp focus. As the man cub Mowgli, Neel Sethi may not have to flex his acting muscles a great deal, but he at least keeps the character sentiment free and believable, which is in itself no mean achievement for a child actor. Voices for the animals are uncannily good especially those of Scarlett Johansson as the snake Kaa; Ben Kingsley as black panther Bagheera and Bill Murray as the celebrated Baloo. Best of all, though, is the Shere Khan of Idris Elba which is sheer magic."", ""As already mentioned the set pieces are fantastic, but in know way unbalance the rest of the film. Particularly impressive are the opening scenes of Mowgli training; the encounter with Kaa; Mowgli’s snatch by the monkeys; the mudslides and the climatic fire. All this is well served by CGI work that is just stunning and, if reports are to be believed, was all filmed in Hollywood’s concrete jungle far from anywhere ‘GREEN’. The cinematography is also beautiful and the 3D adds immeasurably on this occasion to the labyrinth of grass, trees and caves that make up the landscape. Be sure to stay for the end credits where the book itself is opened to add yet another inspirational touch to a very accomplished film that everyone can enjoy."" ]"

It concerns three young burglars who find themselves terrorised by the blind man they are attempting to rob in a desolate Detroit neighbourhood. The film offers up the usual jumpy moments and tension is maintained, but it lacks the real primal force of a ‘Wolf Creek’ or ‘You’re Next’. One sequence where all the lights go off is effectively shot and there is one genuine surprise to be had at around the half way mark. Overall, though, it achieves what it sets out to do. It will be interesting to see if the somewhat open ending unfurls into the hinted at sequel."" ]"

This is a real curio of a black comedy that has a perfectly cast Kate Winslet returning to the small Australian town of Dungaten after being banished as a young girl for a murder she may, or may not, have committed. The town’s people constitute a strange and eclectic bunch. Amongst the saner residents are Liam Hemsworth as the obvious handsome suitor and Hugo weaving as the police officer with a secret, also responsible for sending Winslet’s character away. Best of all is scene stealer Judy Davis as mad Molly, Winslet’s mother with a secret or two of her own. She is great, tossing off witty or acidic throwaways with consummate ease. The film is genuinely funny and taps into the black humour wonderfully, a rare achievement in itself. The costumes and music are divine and the general tone of the film hits its mark. Unfortunately, it does go on a tad too long which is detrimental to the overall impact."" ]"
the-magnificent-seven;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Despite its classic status the Original 1960 ‘Magnificent 7’ must be one of the most over rated films ever made. This new version does nothing to re-ignite any interest in a story that is basically simple to the point of non- existence. As with most film’s one starts watching optimistically, but after a promising but tried and trusted set up one begins to lose interest as Denzel Washington goes off in search of the other titular six. From here on in there really is not much here to pique the imagination. The film drags on for a good hour before finally letting rip with a half hour battle to save the town that is truly exciting and very well staged. The cinematography is the true star and the locations are breathtakingly gorgeous, but the music, half of which is credited to the late James Horner, is inappropriate and lacking strength for such a testosterone fuelled movie. It’s a pretty score, signature Horner in fact, and unobtrusive but it just seems out of place here. The film also would seem to have no right to its title being far from magnificent in its scripted characters. It is actually a misnomer. These characters don’t display anything resembling magnificence, a few of them even ending up as corpses. Most of the actors lack any kind of screen presence or charisma (Washington not withstanding) and the whole enterprise resolves to be a so-so affair. Magnificent? No. Just average."" ]"
deadpool;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The opening titles sequence of Deadpool makes the heart sink in dreaded anticipation of yet another mindless marvel movie. So glory be then for a film full of wit and invention that is not a slave to its visual effects. As the masked superhero Ryan Reynolds impudent charm and intuitive delivery of the sharp and, at times, salty dialogue is spot on. Likewise, his asides direct to camera are delightfully amusing, as are the copious character and movie references. In fact the quips come at such a whip cracking pace that on occasion one’s brain can’t keep up resulting in a gag here and there being missed. Some of the dialogue aims for low brow audience appeal, but even here Reynolds manages to save the day with his astute delivery and innate understanding of how to play to the camera. The adult certificate seems to have freed the film from the usual trite situations and juvenile humour that often derails the PG friendly movies, whilst also allowing the film makers not to stint on the sex and gore. Predictable situations are played out unpredictably and it’s fair to say that what we have here turns the super hero movie on its head even if it does seem a little too pleased with itself on occasion. Technically the film delivers the package expected. The editing is fast and furious and the sound blasts you full throttle with every explosion or gunshot unleashed. Music fits nicely into proceedings and there is also some well-chosen pop on the soundtrack. All in all it adds up to an enjoyably slick experience complete with a manageable running time. Let’s just hope that whoever get their hands on the sequel don’t ruin a potentially fresh franchise by dumbing down what we have here."" ]"
la-la-land;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""La La Land is that rare movie that starts at the top and then goes on and up. At a time when musicals are not at all fashionable this one knocks it out of the park on all emotional and aesthetic levels. It is without question the best film of the year. An audacious opening song and dance number on an L A freeway sets the tone and here is where audiences will either embrace it or leave. Those who stay will be treated to one of those transcendent experiences that are all too rare in today's cinema. Who knew that Emma Stone could be this good demonstrating a range, and a voice, that takes one completely by surprise. Wonderfully supported by Ryan Gosling, the pair effortlessly create chemistry usually not seen outside a lab. Their renditions of a clutch of memorable songs are dynamically performed and stunningly choreographed. Stone's dulcet tones singing' Audition- The fools who dream' is heartbreakingly evocative and succeeds in raising the hairs on one's arms and neck. In fact the score and sound make the film seem like a throwback to an earlier age as does the gorgeous colour cinematography. Technically, every aspect of this unique entertainment has the wow factor. Emotionally the film is very well grounded with its biggest flight of fancy taking place at the Griffith observatory. Director Damien Chazelle trumps his achievement on 'Whiplash' by triumphantly reviving a moribund genre. That he has produced such a dazzling and accomplished piece of cinema in the process is no small feat. If this doesn't win best picture and actress at next year's Oscars (it will of course be loaded with them) then the Academy members themselves must be living in La La Land."" ]"

The musical numbers are extremely well staged especially 'Be my Guest' and 'Gaston' and camera work is imaginative. Luke Evans is a revelation here as 'Gaston' and his charismatic turn more than compensates for the shortcomings of Emma Watson's Rather listless Belle. She fails to impress either musically or dramatically. However, the film is so surprisingly entertaining and breathtakingly beautiful to look at that even her limitations can't derail the overall impact. The score is lovely, although the new songs are not up to the standard of the original ones, and production values -Design, costumes, visual effects, make-up and sound are all on the money.

There is absolutely no dialogue, no character development, no acting, zippo, nada, nothing!  This flick is a non stop shoot up video game for teenage children with ADD.  Scene after scene repeated ad nausea with the bad guys falling like ducks in a shooting gallery.  The good guys outnumbered 1000-1 no direct hits.  I felt like I was watching two hours of Ninetendo's Space Invaders or Asteroids.  Then in the end they threw in some Circus Soleil spectaculars with the goonies swinging back and forth on tall bamboo stilts as sitting targets.  Sorry I just don't get it.  I guess if you like end to end shoot em up, blow em up, loud explosion ridiculous car chase scenes for 2 hours then this is the movie for you.  Exactly why were they chasing them?

Robert Downey Jr. and Rober Duvall were absolutely brilliant as they played themselves basically.  The supporting cast was outstanding.  You sat on the edge of your seat listening to the back and forth barbs as you soon realizes that both father and son are hard asses and if you look in the mirror you would see the other.  The story was very sentimental in which the father becomes the son and the son the father.  It's a very good movie that theater audiences will see as word of mouth will spread."" ]"
jersey-boys;5;5;fantasy;"[ ""Let me preface my review by telling you that the Broadway Musical Jersey Boys is one of my all time favorites. I have seen it a total of 12 times. Having said that I must report that it would be very tough to compare any movie to the actual Broadway show. Believe me I wanted to LOVE it. Unfortunately Director Clint Eastwood who I think the world of is absolutely clueless in directing this movie. Whereas the Broadway version captures the audience's attention in the first few minutes putting a smile on your face, the movie is dark, tedious, and very slow for the first hour or so. It just doesn't resonate with the viewer.. The second hour is somewhat better, but where the Broadway audience is taken on a joy ride, handing out standing ovations, while at the same time, crying with Frankie Valli on the death of his beloved daughter, this movie version just falls flat on its face.  There is little or no character development. The fabulous songs of the Four Seasons are treated more or less like window dressing, nothing more. To be perfectly honest, the best part of the movie is when its over, the credits are rolling, and the cast is singing and dancing in the street.  I would have loved to give Jersey Boys a perfect ten but it's impossible to do so. I recommend that when the touring company comes to your City, run don't walk, to see one of the best shows Broadway has ever produced. I'm sorry to say the movie does it no justice. Sorry."" ]"
the-equalizer;8;8;fantasy;"[ ""Denzel Washington is brilliant as he is born to play this role. There is nothing not to like as the story develops nicely. The villain is expertly played similar to what James Bond 007 usually faced in his adventures. And Denzel improvises for his choice of weapons usually on the fly. He is always one step ahead of the bad guys. He's the type of vigilante we all wish we had in this world. Maybe he can pay a visit to ISIS?  He can do what our President doesn't have the backbone to do!  Basically as our fearful Commander In Chief hasn't learned as yet, you can't negotiate with bad guys that have no respect for human life, theirs or our own. Denzel as The Equalizer makes us stand up and cheer. Can't wait for the sequel. Great action popcorn movie. Go see and enjoy!"" ]"
fury;9;9;fantasy;"[ ""I just came back from watching Fury.  Brad Pitt is outstanding playing a determined Army Sergeant tank commander near the end of WW II.  He leads his weary men into battle in April of 1945 as the Allies march thru Germany.  Just like Saving Private Ryan you will literally sit on the edge of your seat nervously as you have a birds eye view of just how dehumanizing war really is.  It's not for the feint of heart on that I can assure you.  As I watched the movie unfold I could not help but think back to an old movie my father took me to as a boy back in 1955 starring real life war hero Audie Murphy in To Hell And Back.  Audie was the most decorated soldier of all time. He survived the war but died in a plane crash at age 45.  Brad Pitt's portrayal very much resembles Audie Murphy's.  However, this movie is very tough to watch because it takes no prisoners showing the brutality on both sides with its kill or be killed mentality.  Hard to take your eyes off the sliver screen."" ]"

This movie is just plain fun but totally by the numbers as it shows the gamesmanship in the War Rooms as General Manager's & Coaches livelihood is affected by the decisions they make.  The players are just pieces of meat with a certain shelf life.  The sad part is everyone gets paid except the diehard fans who have to suffer with bad decisions by management and the players whose only purpose is to be a free agent mercenary.as in Show Me The Money.  The higher they're drafted the more money and security they get.  I wish I could say there was some suspense in the movie but the truth is you know what Kevin Costner is going to do 15 minutes into the movie.  Diehard football fans will enjoy this.  Anyone else not into pro football don't waste your time.  As for the ending it is preposterous as no number seven pick is ever worth what they traded it for.  The only thing better would have been to see how the players drafted turned out.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with draft.  Just another propaganda piece for the NFL."" ]"

He then slowly starts to tell his father he was in heaven, had an out of body experience, and describes what he saw.  What is lacking is a detailed account of that experience as there was so much more that could have been presented.  It's certainly a feel good story that we all want to believe.

CGI was good.  The two MUTO's were laughable.  Godzilla looked like a fat toad.  He was on the screen for 12 minutes.  The acting other than Brian Cranston and his wife was laughable.  Brian had the good sense to be killed off in the first 30 minutes.  The rest of the actors would have been laughed at in a High School production.  The script was inept with more plot holes than Carter has little liver pills.  The directing was abominable.  I wouldn't watch this horrible movie again even when on FREE TV.

As time went by I did come to understand the great sacrifices he made and the greatness of the man. He is so deserving of his number being retired. If memory serves me correctly Leo Durocher was suspended for being associated with known gamblers, not women? It was Gene Hermanski, not Pee Wee Reese, whom said all the Dodgers should wear number 42. And as inconceivable as it seems, it was Branch Rickey who said you should trade a ballplayer a year too soon rather than a year too late. He traded Jackie to the hated NY Giants in 1956 8 years after he broke the color barrier in 1948. And Jackie hated the NY Giants so much he retired rather than ever wear any other uniform but for his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers.

He had a chance to become GM of the Red Sox and turned it down to stay with the A's.  All it proves is that he likes to beat his head against the wall because longterm he can never win.  I would have liked to see more character development because he is in a no win situation.  No questioning his passion for the job but the truth is baseball without a hardcap is a flawed product in which 99% of the times only the big markets can win!  Nice acting but otherwise the movie is going nowhere.  It is never explained why he is such a troubled soul?  I would have loved to see his life unfold.  What is the definition of insanity?  To do the same thing over and over and to expect a different result.  Billy can find talent but has no chance of ever keeping it the way the current state of affairs is managed under Bud Selig.  I live in NYC but feel the small markets have been shut out of competing.  How can you continually root for IBM but that is what Yankee fans do every year as they must buy every new toy on the free agent market.

secretariat;4;4;fantasy;"[ ""This could have been a great movie if not for Hollywood turning Secretariat the horse into a full blown version of Rocky. Poncho Martin trainer of Sham, Secretariat's arch rival \""Secretariat is going down\"". Folks it never happened. Secretariat was the BEST racehorse that ever peered thru a brial. His accomplishments are virtually unmatched by any horse present, past or future. Why Hollywood filmed the Belmont Stakes at Keeneland and show horses racing on poly turf not dirt is beyond me. For anyone to think that any horsemen would start a fire in a wastepaper basket in a barn surrounded by hay, or that the trainer would say he was afraid to hold the horse as he is out to get him is pure Hollywood. And do you think any trainer would hand a multi million dollar thoroughbred to an owner to give a sponge bath? Basically this is a good family movie in which the outcome is known from the moment the movie starts. John Malkovich portrays a Hall of Fame trainer in Lucien Laurin and plays him as a joker for comic relief. Lucien was a great trainer and is nothing like that. As for Diane Lane she is always lovely to look at. She does her best to portray Secretariat's owner who took on a male dominated sport. What the movie fails to show is the price she had to pay with her family to achieve success. But then again this is a Disney movie and only Happy Endings are approved. My recommendation is that if you are unfamiliar with Secretariat you can feel comfortable in taking the family to see it. But if you are a true horse lover or horsemen you are going to be very disappointed. Secretariat the horse is just a supporting character in a movie that should have been about him.â"" ]"

Despite our best intentions, life never turns out that way. Think JFK and Jackie?

This film is absolutely outstanding as it reveals a real family warts and all. The ensemble cast are all fantastic, especially Jason Bateman {the central character} and Adam Driver.. The latter is the youngest of the siblings, the one in our family that never seems to grow up that we all envy. As the story unfolds, you can't help but see yourself. At times, it's painful to watch, but dead on accurate. The movie will stir your emotions as you can't help but think what if each of us had taken that other fork in the road? This film will not thrill critics as they live in their own snobbish world, however it will resonate with the movie going public. We all wish we could have \""do overs\"" in life, but unfortunately, as we know all too well, there are none.

If you saw Sandra Bullock in the yawn of a movie Gravity where she talks to herself, the The Martian is the same, but this time with Matt Damon in a comedic role which belies all realty.  By the 2nd hour you;re checking your watch asking when this will end.  I'm sorry but when this hits free TV just like Gravity I would never give it a second look.

I go all the way back to the original black and white TV series Mission Impossible with Peter Graves, Martin Landau and Barbara Bain.

This latest movie is a 10 as it will keep you on the edge of your seat, has tension, with just enough comic relief and action to make it very enjoyable.  Cruise is masterful in this flick.   The best part is you won't be able to figure out the ending which I'm always able to do.  This one is a sure crowd pleaser so don't miss it."" ]"

Was it as good as the original?  No not even close because back then we had never seen dinosaurs come back to life so realistically.  So basically coming in we knew what to expect as far as the story goes.  Kids sent to a relative in Jurassic World, this time an Aunt as opposed to Grandfather John Hammond.  Every precaution is taken to protect the guests but as we all know the guests are food for the nothing can go wrong dinosaur theme park.  Chris Pratt as the hero recreates the same character as in the blockbuster hit Guardian's Of The Galaxy, a modern day Harrison Ford if you will.  Whatever can go wrong does go wrong.  And Chris Pratt's character comes to the rescue for the kids and falls in love with the ice cold Aunt who happens to be the director of the park.  It's just a great popcorn flick for the entire family.  The special affects are absolutely outstanding.  Look for this movie to take in over $100 million dollars this opening weekend.

When you use your best lines and dirtiest bits in the first half-hour, an hour later, you're hard pressed to out due yourself. The writers of Why Him? tried to combat this problem, by taking Franco's large than life personality and combining it with the dry humor and physical comedy of Bryan Cranston, and the results were mixed. It's holiday season and Stephanie Fleming (Zoey Deutch), wants her parents to meet her new boyfriend, only she doesn't want to tell them anything about him before hand, because if she did, they probably wouldn't come. They are quiet, reserved suburbanites from Cleveland, and he's a dot com millionaire from California, who loves anything new and unusual. As the two sides of Stephanie's life combine, hilarity ensues or at least it's supposed to. Bryan Cranston and surprisingly young Griffin Gluck had the best lines, and were involved in the funniest moments of this film. As for James Franco, once again, he was too much and he has to realize that every comedic role he takes isn't Pineapple Express. The role here calls for eccentricity, not raunchy and stupid. Right from the start and all the way through, every other word out of his mouth was **** and every stunt he pulled was more immature than the next. It takes a lot away from the film, especially the ending, which was just ridiculous and simply doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The bottom line, the story is interesting, Bryan Cranston is always great and Griffin Gluck was a riot. The film definitely has it's moments, but every time you think it's about to turn a corner, Franco shows up to drop a million F bomb, talk about his penis, and preform stunts better left to the stoner movies."" ]"

In 2014, the Marvel Studios original came out of obscurity to set box office records, introducing fans to a cast of heroes who aren't exactly your typical superheroes. Combining amazing special effects and comedy, the film quickly gained a cult following and critical acclaim, but can they defeat the biggest enemy of all, the curse of the sequel? The Guardians are back doing what they do best, with a new enemy on their tail, when they crash land on an uninhabited planet. Their rescuer comes in a form of a man who seems too good to be true, is he really there to help them or does he have something else in mind? The story in volume two is not as good as the first one, that was to be expected, but luckily it isn't far off. The characters are the same and this time they know each other a whole lot better, meaning the chemistry is better, the humor comes more quickly, and the magic is still there. Once again Chris Pratt is outstanding, it's still hard to believe he went from the annoying jock on Everwood to this charismatic megastar. The rest of the cast is also on it's game and we learn much more about the characters then we did in the first film. While not being as strong story wise, this film certainly hits closer to home, and everything is amped up from the special effects to the humor and even the soundtrack. I love these films and I hope there are a lot more of them, however I'd be remiss in not sharing my thought that something this good, especially with how the story evolves in the second film, is better suited for a weekly TV series than at most a handful of feature films. The Bottom Line, if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one."" ]"
bad-santa-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Despite advertising to the contrary, Bad Santa 2 is not bigger, badder, or funnier than the previous film. In fact, this time they went too far and broke the cardinal rule of comedy. The film goes too far to be as raunchy and funny as the first film, that unfortunately it goes from funny to stupid and by the end, it becomes a farce of itself. In the sequel to this classic comedy, Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is just as broke and drunk as he ever was, and this time he's saddled with a twenty-one year old Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly), who just won't leave him alone. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his old pal Marcus (Tony Cox) is released from prison, and has a job that promises to make them all rich. A reluctant Willie agrees, only to find out the place they are going to hit, employs his worst nightmare, his mother. I was hoping this film would be even half as good as the first one and it certainly does have it's moments, especially when Brett Kelly is involved, but overall this movie just isn't that funny. I don't know if it's because they put it all on the table in the first film and the jokes were just all done, or if it tried too hard, but the laughs just didn't come as easily. I mean how many times can Willie curse at a kid on his lap or make short jokes about Marcus? At least it wasn't just the same film with different names and places, but the jokes are similar, the personalities have changed very little, and I really didn't laugh as much as I hoped that I would. Bad Santa 2, wasn't a bad movie, maybe I was just spoiled by the pure genius of the first film, but I really didn't think it was anything more than your ordinary run of the mill comedy. There is nothing extraordinary about this one, sorry folks."" ]"
doctor-strange;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""At this point anything with the name Marvel attached to it, is box office gold, as is evident by their latest film, Doctor Strange. The Doctor is perhaps one of the least known out of all of their characters, yet he is still pulling in huge numbers. The big question is whether or not the film lives up to the hype, and I can honestly say, I'm not really sure. Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a world renowned surgeon, who is badly injured in a car accident. When modern medicine fails him, Strange starts looking for alternative treatments and finds a bizarre ancient group, that claims they can teach him how to heal himself, and do a whole lot more. The big appeal of this movie, at least for me was the special effects. I knew the effects would be good, but Marvel really out did themselves this time. I watch close to three hundred films a year, and I'm not often impressed by special effects, but the effects in this movie really blew me away. That being said, this is just one of those film you have to shell out the extra money to see in 3D. It's a completely different experience in 3D and you really will be amazed by some of the things they can do. As for the story, it really is the same thing that Marvel keeps doing over and over again. I've really enjoyed the Marvel films and while they are all unique in their own way, the underlying theme always seems to be the same. Someone gets hurt, they lose the girl they love, they find someone or a group of someones who help make them extraordinary, then they fight the bad guys and in the process get the girl. It's a formula that is in every single one of their films and it's getting a little tiresome. The bottom line, Doctor Strange is pure Marvel. What I mean by that is, it's the expected story, with unique traits specific to this character, a Stan Lee cameo, a cast full of superstars, two scenes after the credits, and perhaps the best special effects you'll ever see. If you're a fan of these films, you won't be disappointed by Doctor Strange."" ]"
logan-2017;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Many people have asked why the name Wolverine isn't in the title of the latest X-Men movie. The reason is that this film is not for children. Logan is violent, vulgar, and disturbing, this film will give your kids nightmares. Logan is supposedly the last time Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine, it might also very well end the current X-Men film franchise, that has produced nine feature films and brought in billions of dollars. That being said, I expected an epic conclusion, the likes of which Marvel had never done before, and what I got was somewhat of a disappointment. It takes place in the future and yes, Logan is older, but he's still the Wolverine, so I was expecting a fair bit of fighting and chases, but it seems that was pretty much all this film has to offer. A deteriorating Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) claims that even though a new mutant hasn't been born in decades, he is speaking to one that needs help, and as it turns out he was right. Logan and Prof. X go to rescue the child and bring her to safety, while the government tries to stop that from happening. I get that this is the future and there isn't time to fill us in on everything, but there are some major plot holes with the story that are never explained. This may be a Wolverine movie, but it is also the conclusion of the X-Men, so what happened to everyone and everything else? The stories narrow focus is on these three and getting to their destination, with chase after chase and fight after fight. The film certainly has it's moments and more than it's fair share of F bombs, but where was the whole conclusion element to it? The epic end to one of the biggest franchises in the history of film just isn't there. The big draw seems to be that they finally went for the R rating and showed Logan's true personality and yes, they made the film much more realistic than any other X-Men film, but I didn't have that satisfied feeling when it was all said and done. As for Hugh Jackman, this was easily his best performance as Wolverine. You see his real personality and all that comes with it, and if this wasn't the type of film that it was, released when it was, I truly believe people would be talking about an Academy Award, he was really that good. The harsh reality is that X-Men as we know it, with the cast that we know is probably over, but the way they ended it leaves us with too many unanswered questions and a feeling of unfulfilled promise."" ]"

I can't tell you how long I waited for this movie to come out, it was at the top of my must see list for months, and I was more excited to see this than almost any other film this year. For those unfamiliar with the story, five thousand passengers are in suspended animation for one hundred and twenty years, as they prepare to start a new life on a brand new planet. Thirty years into the journey, there is a malfunction and two of the sleeping pods open, awakening two of the passengers ninety years early. Everything I read and saw made this look like THE film to see this year, but the truth is it was beyond boring. This malfunction that awoke them, was part of a cascade failure, meaning small failure got worse over time, years in fact, and nothing serious actually happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. Until then, it's a lot of talking, romance, sadness about how they'll waste their lives alone on this ship for nothing. This had to be why the studio paid two of the best young actors in Hollywood a ton of money to be in this thing, because they knew no matter how boring the story or bad the reviews got, people would still go to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Congratulations Columbia Pictures, it worked, you made your money on this one and yes the special effect were cool, but how many people were actually entertained by this film? I for one was not, this film come in at just under two hours long and I felt like I was sitting in the theater for a week, that right there says it all."" ]"

Her latest series Fantastic Beasts has finally hit theaters, with the first of what will be a five film series, that starts off a hundred years before Harry Potter stepped into Hogwarts. The film is centered on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who has come to New York City as part of his quest to save the endangered species of the magical world. These creatures live in what appears to be a suitcase, but when some of them escape and a muggle is exposed to Scamander's attempts to retrieve them, he finds himself in a world of trouble. Scamander's only salvation is that with another unknown creature and a dark wizard on the loose, there are other things to worry about, so he is sent with an agent (Katherine Waterston), and the muggle, to collect his creatures and to try to help figure out what is going on. Even though this movie takes place a hundred years before Harry Potter the special effects and especially the CGI on all the creatures involved is amazing! Even if I watched this film without the sound on, I'd still be blown away by how visually impactful it is. As for it's star, they cast one of the biggest up and comers in Hollywood, Eddie Redmayne, and he is perfect for the role. Redmayne is exactly like Harry and the kind of character Rowling loves to write about. He's this geeky, skinny, soft spoken, lovable loser, that no one would expect to be perhaps a hero in waiting. Aside from some corny jokes thrown in for the kids and die hard Potter fans, this movie was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to see where it goes next. Rowling has stated that the other films will focus on other characters, including a younger Dumbledore, which I'm a bit indifferent to. I really liked this film, and I am curious to know what would be the point in a sequel that starts over. I'd imagine it would be to introduce everyone and then bring them all together in the end, but no matter what they do, the producers will be hard pressed to out due this film."" ]"
wonder-woman;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""So DC finally got one right, isn't that what everyone's saying? I completely agree, Wonder Woman was much better than anything else DC has released in a very long time, and it was a pretty great film, but was it as amazing as everyone say it was or are we all a bit bias due to the hype surrounding the film? In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special, I mean to take nothing away from her or her performance with this next statement, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't point this out. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the \""main\"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month."" ]"

I was looking for something simple, stupid, and low-brow to just give me a laugh or two, just enough to keep me awake. I like Seth Rogan, so I choose Sausage Party, a film I'd never normally see, and while it had what I was looking for, surprisingly, it also had a lot more. I was expecting nothing but the typical drug and sex jokes, but in addition to that, there was a cleverness there that I wasn't expecting, the kind of thing you'd normally get from Family Guy. It's hard to say more without spoiling it, but one such element seen in the trailer and used through out the film, is the use of ethnic foods to represent the real life conflicts and stereotypes of the people associated with them. There are also plenty of food related jokes through out the film that seem so obvious for a movie like this, but you didn't think of them, and that's why Seth Rogan never has to pay for his weed.... The bottom line, I'm not saying this film is going to win any awards or that's it's going to become some huge cult classic or anything like that, just that it's far more clever, intelligent, and entertaining than I ever assumed it could be.

captain-america-civil-war;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""As someone who isn't crazy about superhero movies, I can't help but be impressed by Marvel, and just how far their stories and characters have progressed in such a short time. Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film."" ]"

Out of those films some big stars emerged, many of which are still hanging in there making movies today. However, in recent years a new crop of action star has emerged, one that is more charismatic and more of an actor than just simply a big guy. One of the most exciting of the pack is the star of London Has Fallen, Gerard Butler. After surviving a kidnapping attempt in the thrilling, Olympus Has Fallen, President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) won't go anywhere without Mike Banning (Butler) by his side. Despite a lot of chatter, the pair travel to London for a world summit, where terrorists plan on doing a lot more than talking. They plan to distract the high police and military presence by attacking the city, thereby leaving President Asher vulnerable to assassination. So if I'm understanding this correctly, blowing up half of London will distract the U.S. Secret Service enough to leave the U.S. President vulnerable? This is why nobody watches action films for the story lines. We watch these movies to see the incredible moves, the gratuitous violence, the unbelievable special effects, and of course that catch phrase we all know is coming. Gerard Butler stars and he just gets better with every film he is in, as his technique and style remind me so much of a young Bruce Willis. Let's just hope that M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make him shave his head and turn him into a zombie as well. Assisted by a cast of veteran award winners the likes of Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, and Angela Bassit, this film doesn't just have the moves, but it has the star power to back it up. The story here is absolutely ridiculous, but when it comes to a great action film, who really cares?

At 73, with over one hundred films under his belt, is it really that surprising that Robert De Niro is bored and looking to try something new? In reviewing his credits, he's never been in what one would call a raunchy comedy, and for it what it's worth, he was outstanding. De Niro plays a man who has just lost his wife of fifty year, and is looking to reconnect with his Grandson, and of course get laid. After tricking his Grandson into taking him to Florida, the two wind up at Spring Break in South Beach, where the hilarity begins. De Niro's grandson is played by Zac Efron, who took a while to lose the teen idol label and find his niche as the awkward, but lovable guy in these extreme comedies. Their two characters are so different, that just bringing the personalities together is enough to make things funny, but when you throw them into ridiculous situations together the laughter is off the charts. Personally, I am someone who has found some of the most classic comedies of all time to be a waste of time. Humor is something I enjoy, but not something that I understand easily, and I found Dirty Grandpa to be one of the funniest films, I've ever seen. You will not believe just how raunchy it gets or the lengths De Niro is prepared to go to in order to get some good laughs at his age. I too was thinking this film would be \""okay\"" at best, but I was wrong, and so are my fellow critics. Dirty Grandpa is hysterical and those who are avoiding it due to bad reviews and similarities to other films, are really missing out."" ]"

I also love how the cast has always fit into their roles as if they were written just for them. People who never read the books, assume that all four movies are about this strange war game, and they couldn't be more wrong. The games are just a part of the story and are what ultimately spark the people to rebel against an oppressive government. What the Hunger Games is really about, is pushing your limits to become something more than you ever thought possible. In the spectacular finally of the series, the Civil War is on and it will take a dangerous mission into the capital to bring it to an end. Part 2, is just as exciting and well done as the other films with one exception, and that's why it's the only one of the four films to receive less than a perfect rating. Mockingjay was only one book, but they split it in two for the sake of making more money from another film. While this was a good idea to the film company, the fact is that there wasn't enough substance left for the final movie. Some scenes were rushed, while others moved to slow, and for the first time, whole sections, such as Katniss's training and newly formed bond with Joanne, were completely removed. While the film was excellent, I feel as though it was somewhat rushed and that the continuity was not as solid as it had been in previous films. That being said, it's still an epic conclusion and if you aren't already aware of the ending, you'll certainly be shocked and surprised by what happens, so while it's not the best of the four films, it's still well worth your time."" ]"
matt-shepard-is-a-friend-of-mine;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""Matthew Shepard represents many things to many different people. For some he stands as a symbol of why people need to fight for equality, for others he opened their eyes to the horror and abuses that people go through every day simply for being different. What's easy to forget however, is that first and foremost, Matthew Shepard was a human being. Shepard was a friendly, kind, outgoing, young man from a small town and there in lied the problem. In a town of a few thousand, Shepard stood out and everyone knew who he was and what he was. One night, a couple of drunk rednecks decided to mess with him, it went too far, and they killed him. This film, isn't about that though, it isn't one of the many films about the symbol that Shepard became or the fight for equal rights his story ignited. This is a film, by a long time friend of Matt's, who simply wanted the world to know about her friend. Michele Josue interviews Matt's brokenhearted family and friends about his life, from childhood up until his untimely death, and weather your gay or not, weather you respect gay rights or not, you can't help but feel for these people who lost such a bright, loving, artistic person, who made everyone around him just that much better for knowing him. It's a terrific documentary and I was very happy that for once, a documentary focused on the life of the man instead of the tragic way that he was killed."" ]"
spectre;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Spy films are a dime a dozen, so what makes James Bond so special? Is it the fight scenes, the crafty villains, his style, or maybe just all of it combined? James Bond time means time to try new things in film, which is why even twenty-four films later, the story is still fresh and the character is still relevant. Spectre may be no different in terms of James Bond on a mission to stop a madman from destroying the world, but each film is different in the way it is shot, and each Director and actor brings their own take, style, and personality to the series. Spectre is a lot more audience friendly and lot easier to follow than many previous Bond films, but what made this one really special was the unique action sequences that I've never seen anywhere else. The balcony and helicopter scenes alone are enough to get any action junkies blood pumping. In film number twenty-four, James Bond is following up on the events in Skyfall, trying to find out who killed M. During his investigation he discovers something a lot bigger, an underground global terror network, that is responsible for many of the missions he's had to go on. Daniel Craig is of course fantastic and I still content that he is far and away the best Bond ever, but in this film, he meets a villain who may be one of the best villains ever. There is just something about Christoph Waltz that makes audiences hang on his every word. We first saw it in Inglorious Bastards six years ago, and since then he's only gotten better. The chemistry and friction between the two characters and the two actors trying to one up each other is nothing short of spectacular. While many fans of the series don't like how modern it's become, I feel as though the series is re-inventing itself with each film, and Spectre, is definitely among the most unique and special in the series."" ]"
vacation-2015;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""I'm not the biggest comedy fan and I never liked Chevy Chase, but the new Vacation movie peaked my interested because of it's star, Ed Helms. Helms is one of the funniest men in Hollywood today and never really gets the recognition he deserves, always being a member of the pack, but he truly shines in one of his few stand alone roles. Twenty years after the original Vacation, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) wants to relive his vacation to Wally World with his own family, and as expected, nothing seems to go as planned. Helms was truly hysterical and in my opinion easily outshines Chevy's performance in the original film, but Helms isn't the only star of note in this film. 11 year old Steele Steebins almost steals the show as Kevin Griswold. From beating on his older brother to his perfectly timed one liners, this kid was absolutely hysterical, and has a bright future ahead of him. Together with Helms and a classic story this movie had me laughing so hard, there were tears in my eyes. Often times when companies decide to remake classic films, they are little more than a farce of the original, but in the case of Vacation, the remake overtake the original by leaps and bounds. Simply put this is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple of years. I thought it would be good, but it went far beyond all expectations, and is now our latest must see movie!"" ]"
american-heist;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""It isn't fair and it isn't right, but in the minds of many moviegoers, certain performers will always be associated with their most memorable roles. For me, Hayden Christensen will always be Anakin Skywalker, and it's strange to see him in anything but a Science Fiction film, but that doesn't mean he's not capable of playing anything else, as he shows in American Heist. Christensen plays James Kelly, an man who became an ex-con, for simply looking up to and trying to help his older brother, Frankie (Adrien Brody). As James is getting his life on track, Frankie is being released from prison and is of course looking for one big score. Now, James has to decide what's more important, keeping his new life on track or saving his older brother. Hayden Christensen gives an admirable performance, once you get passed the initial shock of Anakin cursing and covered in tattoos, but it's Adrien Brody who steals the show. Brody isn't an Academy Award winner for nothing, as his character pulls at the heart strings and has you running the gambit of emotions. Everyone knows someone like Frankie and wonders which way they'll turn out. In this case, there is also the added incentive of finding out if he'll drag his brother along with him, either way. American Heist isn't the best film out there, the story has been done, and at times, it's a little dull. This film is more about the characters and their values more than anything else. There's a fair share of language and guns, but unlike many other thrillers, that's not really the focus here, which in the end, is appreciated."" ]"
strangerland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Set in the Australian outback, Strangerland tells the story of a family that has recently relocated to a small town that is literally in the middle of nowhere. The move seemed like an odd choice, but as you will later find out, it was a necessary one, but needless to say no one is particularly happy about it, especially the families two kids. One day there is a report of a large dust storm headed towards town and the parents go to get their children to safety, only to discover they are nowhere to be found. The local sheriff is called in, but he's not moving fast enough for the father, so he takes things into his own hands, further complicating things. Aside from the unusual setting and circumstances of the disappearance, this film isn't all that original, in fact, except for the ending and the location, it was really very similar to the film, Prisoners. The investigation was fairly interesting, as was the setting, Hugo Weaving was good as the sheriff, but was really the only interesting character with any kind of personality or background of interest. As for the rest of the cast, they're kind of just there, they don't talk much about themselves or their past and the film has an extremely narrow focus. Nicole Kidman just cries a lot and Joseph Fiennes wants to yell at anyone who will listen, which unfortunately is us. The bottom line, Strangerland is an average, forgettable film, it has enough going for it that it will keep your attention and it moves at a decent pace, but the characters are nothing to write home about, the performances are nothing special either, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand what's going on or what happened in the end."" ]"
warcraft;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""I had to see the new film Warcraft, out of shear curiosity, I mean how could they possibly turn an MMORPG into a feature film? On one hand, the producers wanted to make an epic film like Lord of The Rings, so there are crazy sets, ridiculous customs, awesome special effects, and even a narrator, but they also wanted to make the WOW geeks happy too, so there are realms, clans, portals, kings, wizards, betrays, and if you've never played the game it's all very confusing and more than somewhat boring. The story is complicated, but to sum it up, an evil wizard has destroyed the Orcs home world, so he has opened a portal to the realm of the humans, where the Orcs think they'll have an easy time taking over, but didn't expect the humans to have a magic Guardian. It's a film of fighting, gibberish, and non-sense that I'm sure the gamers loved, but I didn't, I fell asleep. As for the cast, well, I guess the filmmakers spent all their money on the effects and costumes, cause there is really no one of name in this film, and some of these people honestly wouldn't have been cast in their high school plays. Some of the actors were so bad, I think they agreed to do this for free, just to have a major motion picture on their resume. The bottom line, I saw it for curiosity and I'm sure a lot of other people will too. The special effect were really cool and it looks terrific in 3-D, but the story is confusing, it's just one crazy fight after another and there really isn't much of a point to the whole thing. If you're going to see it, go see it in 3-D. It makes the effects look cooler and if you fall asleep, the people you are with won't notice and won't bother you."" ]"

No matter how good they are, until they find that role, they won't be a household name and are forced to take whatever roles they can get. Even megastars, like Chris Pratt got his start on a low rated CW drama, and did B-movies for a decade before he was cast as Star Lord, this is the position Keir Gilchrist finds himself in now. Gilchrist is an exceptional young actor, who always gives his best, but without that big role on his resume, he's forced to take jobs like this one. Dark Summer follows Daniel, (Gilchrist) a 17 year old who has recently been sentenced to house arrest for stalking a girl from his school. To make matters worse, his parents are away for the summer and Daniel is all alone. As boredom ware away at him mind, Daniel starts to see things and wonders if he's being punished for his crimes by some supernatural entity, or if he's just going insane from boredom. For much of this movie, the actor is bored, and if the actor is bored, what do you think the audience is feeling? Daniel's days are filled with monotonous discussions with friends, who sneak over, and of course investigations that turn up nothing. As for his nights, they are filled with a lot of jump scares and loud noises that again ultimately turn up nothing, as Dark Summer is just one of those films where nothing happens until the last twenty minutes, and by then, who really cares anymore? The bottom line, even a great actor couldn't save this film, it's your typical supernatural horror film, filled with a lot of jump scares, good looking people, and a whole lot of nothing else until the very end."" ]"
virtuosity;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Virtuosity was a big budget 90s film, that despite having a great cast, was a big flop. After I watched the film, it's fairly easy to see why. The premise of the film is that a police training, virtual reality serial killer, programmed with over 200 personalities, gets put into a robotic body and reeks havoc on LA. Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialogue, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out."" ]"
the-divergent-series-insurgent;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I am a huge fan of the Divergent series, and after reading all the books, I went so far as to proclaim that parts of it were even better than the Hunger Games. Unlike The Hunger Games and the first film in the series, Insurgent starts to veer away from the novel, making it hard for the fans, to envision just how they'll make the jump into the third book in the series. In what was once Chicago, the war between the factions has begun, and this time, no faction is safe from the Erudite. The intellectual faction has started collecting all the Divergent, in an attempt to open a mysterious box, that supposedly contains something that will change all their lives forever. Tris and Four are on the other-side, doing everything they can to stop the group from hunting the Divergents, whom they see as the key to changing everything. The first part of this film is an excellent representation of the novel and is every bit as exhilarating, but the second part veers off into a new direction. The films producers said they wanted to make the story easier for the casual fan to understand, and they did that, unfortunately, taking away the complexity of the story, takes away some of it's magic. As for the ending, it is completely different from the novel, leaving many to wonder if they'll make the third book into a film at all. Indeed they plan to, but it's hard to see just how they will go about doing it, after the events put in place by the end of this film. Shailene Woodley and Theo James returned for the sequel and again, they played the characters to tee, I really felt like these two were meant to play Tris and Four before the book was even set to be released on the big screen. Once again, the special effects, the acting, and the story are amazing, and this film would be worthy of five stars, if not for the ending that diverted too far away from the original story."" ]"
supremacy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Some stories are so far fetched, that they couldn't possibly be anything but a true story. Supremacy is one of those films that is ripped from the headlines, telling the incredible true story of Garrett Tully, a white supremacist who was out of jail for less than twenty-four hours. Tully (Joe Anderson) was released on parole, after spending most of his life behind bars. He was on his way back to the white supremacist strong hold he called home, when he and his girlfriend are stopped by a policeman, a black policeman. It doesn't take long for Tully to jump out of the car and kill the officer, before going on the run. The pair makes their way to a suburban area, where they break into a house and take a black family hostage. Aside from the obvious tension of a hostage situation, there is also extreme racial tension, that makes the whole situation that much harder for the people involved. As events play out, something miraculous starts to occur as Tully, starts to sympathize with his hostages. Danny Glover stars as The homeowner, Mr. Walker, and was beyond phenomenal. Glover excels in films that involve race, because he has this quiet simple way about getting his message across. He's never over the top or in your face about it, he's just a simple man who states the truth, something most people easily relate to. Aside from Glover's performance and the obvious question about what's going to happen, this film was a dud. There is a lot of waiting around, racial slurs, and arguing before we get any answers we seek. Supremacy is basically a film you start to watch, and would like to turn off, but you can't until you find out what happens. My advice, Danny Glover has plenty of other similar significant roles under his belt, and you'd save a lot of time and frustration by simply googling Garrett Tully."" ]"
little-accidents;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""In a small mining town, an accident has killed several workers, leaving a lone survivor, Amos Jenkins (Boyd Holbrook). The townspeople are furious and blame the mines owner, the towns wealthiest resident, a cold, heartless man, who many suspect caused the accident with his shortcuts and cheap business practices. The town is out for blood, but only one of them, literally, as soon after the accident, the mine owners teenage son turns up dead. Little Accidents is yet another example of these dark modern noir type films, that have become so popular the past decade, and normally I am a huge fan of them. This film however, may have had the modern noir feeling, but actually had the old noir story line AKA slow, strange, and confusing. I chose this film because one of it's stars is Jacob Lofland, who at just 21 years old, has only been acting for 5 years, but he is a natural in every sense of the word. Every performance he has given has been better than the one before it. His talent has lead him to leading roles in the Maze Runner series, as well as the AMC show, The Son. Being as fond of his style as I am, I decide to go back and watch his filmography from the beginning, and that's where I found Little Accidents. While Lofland's part was minor, you are still able to see some of the skills that brought him to where he is today. Paired with Elizabeth Banks and Josh Lucas, this was one fantastic cast, featured in a terrific setting, and I was sure this film was a can't miss, but the story had other ideas. Little Accidents was all over the place, some of things that happened have nothing to do with the story, and make little sense. The Bottom Line, don't let a terrific cast fool you, this film is slow and all over the place. The mystery, isn't much of one and the story will leave you scratching your head."" ]"

Lake is moving on with his life when new information comes to light, that his old nemesis, a terrorist leader long believed dead, is back. Knowing their best chance to catch him is Lake, they turn to him for help, but can he keep it together long enough to complete his mission? This unbelievably was a b-movie, yet a remarkably strong performance for Nicholas Cage, who randomly had to go between C.I.A. legend and confused old man. His performance is aided by the late Anton Yelchin, playing an analyst who admires Lake so much, that he goes against orders to help him with his mission. The whole dynamic between the man at the end of his career on his last mission, and the boy at the start of his career on his first mission, really added something different, that you don't typically see in espionage films. Dying of The Light really does have a lot to like about it, but one must remember, it is an espionage film and a direct-to-video one at that. The writing isn't spectacular and parts of it are more than somewhat confusing. They also throw in a lot of Evan's flashbacks and delusions at the completely wrong times, which really did start to bother me as the film got more intense. Overall, I did enjoy this film, I thought the acting was terrific, and I loved the dynamic and chemistry between the two leading men, despite the obvious age difference. Dying of The Light certainly isn't a perfect movie, but it's still an entertaining one."" ]"

Realizing they've been taken, they plan on kidnapping the billionaires son and the ridiculousness begins again. The old bosses and old accomplishes join new face for another adventure that's even more absurd than the first one was. I watched this film because I love Jason Sudeikis, he is one of my favorite comedic actors, however Charlie Day is not. I really don't know how anyone can stand watching It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, with this little guy running around, with his high pitched rabbit voice, always excited like he just did an eight ball before every single scene he shoots. It's honestly one of the most annoying things I can think of. This film was kind of lame and leaned toward the stupid side to begin with, but when you add this little squirrel on crack to the mix, it really becomes nearly unwatchable. The bottom line, sequels make money. Some people want to learn the fate of characters they've seen and gotten to know. Then there are people like me, who went to see the first one and even though they weren't crazy about it, figured I might as well go see the next one. I can only hope at this point they don't decide to make it into a trilogy."" ]"

Most of these films are based on true stories, and are as real as it gets, but sometimes, no matter how amazing the story, it doesn't necessarily make for the best cinema. 23 Blast is one of those films, as it tells the inspirational true story of Travis Freeman (Mark Hapka), a star High School Football player, on his way to a College scholarship, when a rare illness struck him blind. For many High School students, football is just a means to popularity, but for Travis, football was his whole life. His illness left him devastated and almost killed him, until miraculously, with the help of an unorthodox coach and supportive teammates, Travis was able to play again. The story here is almost unbelievable, and while it would make for a terrific episode of ESPN's 30 for 30, I found it severely lacking in content for a feature film. 23 Blast is the directorial debut of actor, Dylan Baker, and while he does a great job of telling the story and inspiring the audience, there just isn't enough story here to keep people interested for a full ninety minutes. The film focuses a lot on Travis's depression and rehabilitation, while a key component of the story, it also takes up a good majority of the film. If one were to shorten those scenes, there wouldn't be enough for a full length film. As for the young cast, they turned in surprisingly strong performances, in particular Mark Hapka, was excellent, but in the end it all comes down to this. 23 Blast, while inspirational, also moves extremely slowly, as it keeps coming back around to a single focus, Travis's illness. There is no deviation from the main story line, and things continue to go around in circles, until the last half hour or so when they finally get to the point. Basically, I loved the story, Travis Freeman is an inspiration, but the film is a bit of a snooze."" ]"

These films are always full of twists and unlikely heroes, but in his latest film, The Judge, Grisham takes a step back. The lawyers he creates have always been young and smart, but inexperienced and in over their heads, this time, it's just the opposite. Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) has left his small town upbringing behind and has become one of the biggest criminal defense attorneys in the country. Law has always been in his family, as his father, Joseph (Robert Duvall) has been a judge in that small town for nearly fifty years. Hank is home for a rare visit, when he starts to notice his father is deteriorating, but does little about it. One night, The Judge goes out to the store and hits someone with his car, his son contends, it was a simple accident, but the district attorney thinks it's something more, due to the Judge's former connection with the victim. Despite them never seeing eye to eye, and despite the Judge's stubbornness, he sees no choice but to let his big shot son defend him. Both actors in this film are terrific, few are as good as Robert Duvall, but the chemistry in this film is a bit of a problem. Robert Duvall is always this humble soft spoken guy, that pulls at the heart strings, but Robert Downey Jr. has a personality that's bigger than life itself. While Duvall was amazing, Downey Jr. always seemed to overpower him in their scenes together. The combination made for a few good laughs, but overall, Downey's personality overshadows the empathy the crowd had for Duvall. The bottom line, The Judge may not be John Grisham's most thrilling work, but it does pose some interesting questions of law and explores the necessity of a father/son relationship, even when the two parties don't really get along."" ]"

B.J. wants to leave his friends on a high note, and decides in order to accomplish this, he needs to \""borrow\"" some money from his shady boss. What B.J. doesn't know is just how connected his boss really is, and once it's discovered that he took the money, his life, and the lives of his two closest friends end up being in jeopardy. Logan Huffman stars and fails to follow up on the success he had in his debut film, Underdogs. In that film, Huffman looked like he would be the next big thing in Hollywood, but playing a dim-witted character in a somewhat anti-climatic story didn't do him any favors. He is paired with Jeremy Allan White, better known as Lip, in the hit series Shameless. I was hoping to see him open up and show some range with this role, but the truth is he was just playing the same character, a highly intelligent young adult who makes poor choices. As far as the story goes, it was pretty interesting, but there are too many breaks in the main story, which distract you from the big picture. There is a lot of discussion and strains on the groups friendship, which pop up at the absolute worse times and pretty much stop the film dead in it's tracks. Bad Turn Worse really did feature a pretty good story, with a ton of up and coming young Hollywood talent. It's very appealing in many ways, but also disappointing in others."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""It is a common misconception among people who never read the series, that all the books are similar and simply about the games. They don't realize that the games are just a small part of what is happening in Suzanne Collins futuristic world of Panem. If you've only seen the first film, and you're thinking that the rest are just the same thing in another setting, you couldn't be more wrong. Normally I would give a synopsis of the story before I review the film, but it's difficult to do without spoilers, so I will say, that Mockingjay couldn't be more different than the other films/books. There are no games, but the story does follow some of the people you met in the games. Once again, this film is like a page for page telling of the book in such a way that I've never seen before or since. When you read a book, often times you get pictures in your head of people, places, and things. When those films are transferred to the screen, most of the time, what you pictured in your head is not what you're seeing on the screen. The Hunger Games is different, because it really is like Suzanne Collins was in my head when I was reading the book and transferred my thoughts to film. It's what I loved about the first two films, and that hasn't changed in the third movie, despite a new Director. Once again,  Jennifer Lawrence stars and continues to be the perfect choice to play Katniss Everdeen. Years ago, when I first read the Hunger Games books, I thought to myself that if this ever became a movie Jennifer Lawrence would be the perfect choice to play Katniss and apparently Collins had the same thought. Lawrence is the focus of the film and with all of America and Panem watching her, the Mockingjay shines, as both the face of innocence and as a leader to her people. I've read a lot of books before I've seen their film adaptations, but never has a story jumped so vividly from the pages to the screen. This series continues to be exciting, inspiring, and just plain terrific. If you're the kind of person who is turned off by sequels, don't let that stop you from catching up with the Hunger Games, because every film is just as good, if not better than the film before it."" ]"

In this long awaited sequel, Harry (Jeff Daniels) is in need of a kidney and finds out that his only living relative is a daughter he never knew about. That's all it take to get Harry and Lloyd back on the road for more antics AND... they tried too hard. The original film was legitimately laugh out loud funny, while it's sequel may lead to a snicker or two. The beauty of the original is that it was so simple and so stupid that you couldn't help but laugh. The new one is full of long running pranks, modern slang the pair don't understand, and just obvious jokes. There's absolutely no spontaneity, like when Harry chucks the salt over his shoulder or Lloyd puts laxative in Harry's tea. That's not the only issue here, as the bad guys are kind of the biggest joke in the movie and Lloyd finally crosses the line from cute to creepy. The bottom line, I loved seeing Carrey and Daniels together again and I enjoyed the parallels to the first film, but aside from a few misunderstandings and a line here or there, this film isn't even close to being the film fans waited twenty years to see."" ]"

McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel.

They have terrific chemistry and I expected great things from them in the future. It might have something to do with the fact that their characters are always so similar, but the more I've seen them together, the less impressed I've been. Seth Rogan is kind of annoying to begin with, especially that chuckle of his, but it's usual balanced out by Franco's extreme behavior. In the Interview, this dynamic didn't work, as Franco's character and portrayal was even more annoying than Rogan's. The cameos may have been impressive and so was all the attention this film received, but the truth is that many of the jokes were amateurish, and the film was a giant step back from Pineapple Express. When people work together, especially comedic duos, the films are supposed to keep getting funnier and more outrageous, but Rogan and Franco seem to be going the other way. The Interview isn't a great story and it isn't that funny, in fact, it's more frustrating than anything else. I love both Seth Rogan and James Franco, they've both given me hours of quality entertainment, but sadly enough, I can't add the Interview to that list, as it's bark was much worse than it's bite."" ]"
the-giver;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""It was the Nebula award winning novel that took the science fiction world by storm. Almost immediately after it's release, talk of turning The Giver into a feature film began, but turning a complex science fiction story into something general audiences could enjoy was a big issue. Studio, cast delays, and re-writes held the film up for more than a decade, but in 2014 it was released and it is spectacular! In the not so distant future, on top of a mountain, lays a futurist society in which pain, war, and disease has been eliminated at a huge cost. With all that society has gained, it has lost the ability to exercise individuality and free thought, this effects everyone except for one, The Giver. The Giver is the historian, who keeps the memory of what life used to be like, so that society never forgets that what it's gained far outweighs the cost. The Giver however is old and must train a replacement. At the choosing ceremony, a young teenager named Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is chosen. Once Jonas learns the truth, he must decide to do the job of The Giver or reveal the truth, in the hopes of bringing back individuality, but at what cost? Originally producers wanted Lloyd Bridges to play the Giver, when he passed, his son took on the role, and while he doesn't fit the mold of an elder statesman, he was still amazing. Meryl Streep also partakes in this magical film, playing the settlements leader, and she is every bit as chilling and suspenseful as the character in the book. At this point, I'm really convinced that there isn't a role she can't play successfully. Even with all the star power, far an away the best performance in this film is given by Brenton Thwaites, a British actor I'd never seen before. Aside from his tremendous good looks, Thwaites portrayal of a teenager with the fate of the world on his shoulders is better than even that of Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games. The passion and charisma he portrays was absolutely infectious and helped carry the film through even the slowest parts. The Bottom Line, the book is a Sci-Fi lovers dream, while the movie is a lot different in order to attract a more mainstream audience, the power and genius of the story remains, and for that The Giver joins our list of must see movies!"" ]"
the-expendables-3;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""After the success of the sequel, everyone knew the Expendables was destine to become a trilogy, because after all, there were still a few action stars who hadn't gotten in on the action (pardon the pun). This time however things did get a little out of hand, as one can see by the enormous cast in the movies poster. the Expendables added something this time around that the other two films were severely lacking in, comedy, whether it was intentional or not. Included in this were how Barney's team had to be bigger than ever to fight the baddest guy of them all, Mel Gibson. Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger taking part in a machine gun battle from a golf cart, since they obviously can't run anymore, and they even managed to sneak in a joke about Wesley Snipes being in prison for not paying his taxes. New editions included Kellan Lutz, Kelsey Grammer, Ronda Rousey, and various other UFC personalities, leading to a lot more hand to hand stuff than in previous films, but much like the other films, the third installment of the Expendables was an action junkies dream come true. There were non-stop explosions, gun battles, and bodies, all surrounded by a very thin and improbable story. We don't watch these movies for the story or even the characters, we watch these films simply for the adrenaline rush. In that context alone, Expendables 3 hits the target every time, but if you're looking for a good story, great performances, or even a reason behind the madness, then you're watching the wrong series. When it comes to the Expendables think less Die Hard and more Michael Bay."" ]"
life-of-crime;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""The plan was simple, kidnap a rich suburban woman, while her husband and son are out of town. The husband is corrupt, so he will be more than willing to pay a ransom, in order to keep them quiet, and to get his wife back, right? This group of bumbling, life-long criminals thought they had it all figured out, except for one small problem, Frank Dawson (Tim Robbins) isn't really interested in getting his wife back. This strange film, based on the novel, Switch by Elmore Leonard, takes place in the late 70's, and had critics raving, but after seeing it for myself, I'm left with one question, why? After the kidnapping takes place, the film moves at a snails pace, with criminals arguing, and phone calls back and fourth, nothing happens for the majority of the film. Jennifer Aniston stars and gives probably the worst performance I've ever seen her give. She is this spoiled, whiny, rich **** who just doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut. It really got to the point where every time she spoke I cringed. On the other hand, Tim Robbins, who plays her husband, was hilarious, but not in the film nearly enough. One of my favorite young actors, Charlie Tahan, also has a role in the film, as their son. In the brief amount of screen time he has, we see a very troubled and confused kid, an angle that could have helped the story, but he too was hardly used. The majority of the film features Jennifer Aniston interacting with her kidnappers and trying to form a bond with the bumbling idiots. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or just a comedy of errors wrapped up in a dramatic theme, but either way it doesn't work. Most of the cast is absolutely horrible, the majority of the film is unbelievably slow, and the parts that aren't, just don't make a whole lot of sense. Life of Crime had quite a few side stories that could have been utilized to fill up the space and break up the monotony, but it was all left on the cutting room floor, leaving us with a film that could be used as a method of torture at Guantanamo Bay."" ]"
the-prince;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Paul (Jason Patric) is a mafia hit-man in New Orleans, and with a baby on the way, he wants out. Paul thinks the only way to do that is to kill his boss (Bruce Willis). With a car bomb in place, Paul waits for his boss to leave for the day, but is shocked to see the bosses wife and daughter get into the car instead. After the tragedy, Paul and his family flea and for 18 years, live in peace, but that all changes when his daughter goes down to New Orleans for a weekend getaway and disappears. The dry, emotionless, Jason Patric stars in this film and as it turns out, he's perfect for the role. As The Prince, the heir apparent, Patric has to play both a loving father and a ruthless criminal and does so admirably. While he's listed in the background, he really is the star of the movie, with the other big names making sporadic appearances. It's a shame, because Bruce Willis's boss character seemed to be a really interesting guy, who I'd have loved to see more of and learn more about. The Prince isn't very unique and you can't help but draw parallels to A History of Violence. While not as good, the film still features some intense action and a great story. The one draw back is that the Prince is so focused on this man Paul, and his goals, that they ignore some very compelling side stories. Had I been the writer, I would have utilized flashbacks through out, to show more of the prince and the bosses story, but sadly they didn't. Aside from that I really enjoyed the film, it was a chase, a mystery, and a mafia film rolled into one, with some great cameos, and an unexpected ending. This is the kind of action film I'd love to see more of. It isn't simply about the special effects and the guns, there is a purpose behind all of it, and that makes all the difference."" ]"
good-people;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I saw this movie 4 years ago when it was called Ca$h, but that was a comedy and this was a thriller, still it's amazing just how similar the two films are. Good People and Ca$h are so much alike, that I don't know how the producers of this film didn't get sued! Good People takes place in London and focuses on another young couple down on their luck. They're about to lose everything when their downstairs tenet dies and they find a bag of cash in the ceiling. Much like the couple in Ca$h, they face the dilemma of keeping the money or turning it into the police. Of course they have to keep the money for there to be a film, but shortly after, the rightful owners show up and want their cash, leaving the couple on the run. James Franco and Kate Hudson play the young couple and to my surprise, despite their very different styles, they had great chemistry, but that's really all this film had. It's very hard to review a film that is so similar to another, because I find myself unimpressed by the second film and wonder, if I hadn't seen the first, would I have enjoyed the second? As far as thrillers go, it wasn't much different or better than you'd expect it to be, despite the big names in the cast. Ultimately, Good People isn't a bad film, but I preferred the story in a more comedic form with Sean Bean playing a foul mouthed, wise cracking gangster. If you're a fan of any of the cast members, you should see this film, because it definitely wasn't boring, but it really wasn't anything special."" ]"
radio-free-albemuth;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""From Philip K. Dick, the mind behind the Terminator, Blade Runner, & Total Recall, (just to name a few) comes one of his most abstract and best reviewed novels, Radio Free Albemuth. Since being released in the early 80's, Science Fiction fans and literary scholars alike have analyzed it over and over again. They seem to think there is a deeper meaning, but to me the meaning of the story is simply that every single person can make a difference and change the world, if they are inspired to do so. Radio Free Albemuth is Philip K. Dick's biography, only in an alternate universe. Dick is a Science Fiction writer and the narrator of the film, who tells the story of his friend Nicholas Brady  (Jonathan Scarfe). Brady is an ordinary guy who one day starts receiving visions of the future. Most people think Brody is crazy, especially his wife, until all of his predictions start to come true. Brady moves his family to L.A., where he becomes a record executive and that's where the story really takes off. The world these people live in is a police state, cause by the hysteria brought on by terrorism and The Cold War. Brady comes to realize that he is the key to changing the world for the better. All he has to do is find out how to do it and who or what is instructing him to do so. The alternate Phillip K. Dick, played admirable by Shea Whigham, is a witness to the events and makes it his mission to chronicle the work of his friend. Like most writers, Dick was known for being more than a little eccentric and many have questioned where this story came from, and weather or not Dick believe he was experiencing the same types of messages that Brady was. As for the film, it is just so well done, and I've always love stories that take place in alternate realities. The story is as much political as it is scientific, and when you throw in the inspirational message that anyone can change the world for the better, you've got one hell of a story. From beginning to end, the cast is terrific, especially the mysterious Sylvia, played by Alanis Morrisette of all people. I knew she was in Dogma, but I had no idea just how good and actress she could be, isn't it ironic? Radio Free Albemuth has everything I look for in a movie and then some, and it is written by one of the best there ever was, I can't possibly recommend it enough."" ]"
sex-tape;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""From the cast and crew that brought you Bad Teacher, comes Sex Tape, and on the surface it had all the makings of the next big comedic hit. Many people were saying that Sex Tape could be the next Hangover, as it is an original idea with an all-star cast, but sadly it falls well short of expectations. Annie & Jay's marriage has become a little stale, so one night they decide to spice things up by making a Sex Tape. Jay is a music producers and inexplicably neglects the fact that his laptop is connected to many other devices, and the tape finds its way to the cloud. Once again, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz have absolutely no chemistry. They are too different types of actors that just don't compliment each other and they are even less believable as a married couple. If that were the only issue with this film, maybe I could have gotten passed it, but the real problem, as with Bad Teacher, is that the writers don't know their audience. This is an R rated film about a sex tape and in no way meant for children, yet the jokes are on a sixth grade level. As an adult going to see a raunchy comedy, I'm not interested in jokes about erections and diarrhea, it's in very poor taste and isn't something many adults will respond to. This film is supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, but there was barely even a snicker in the movie theater, which basically tells you all you need to know about this film. Sex Tape is trying to get people to see it under the guise of being raunchy and featuring some pretty attractive stars, that fans hope they will get to see naked. The truth is that it is very amateurish, you really don't see all that much, and the jokes could be out of PG movie. All in all, Sex Tape is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time."" ]"
cold-in-july;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""For lack of better terminology, these dark, southern, noirish, dramas have become all the rage in Hollywood. Films like Winter's Bone, Joe, and Mud have been highly critically acclaimed and have come to define the 2010 decade in film, but where there is success, there are bound to be copycats, enter Cold In July. Whoever thought that Don Johnson would have any kind of chemistry with Dexter what so ever, must have been out of there mind, as right from the beginning, this film was doomed. A simple man kills a home invader and is stalked by the father of the man he killed. Obsessed with taking a life and wanting to know more about what led to this man become the person he's become, Dane (Michael C. Hall) and his team of misfits, stalk the family right back and uncover an even bigger mystery. While this story had potential, the writers thought it was too dark and decided to have some fun with it. Isn't that nice of them, to combine misplaced comic relief with actors who have no chemistry at all? Cold In July doesn't only lack chemistry but it also lacks focus. At times this film is as dark and serious as it gets, then just as quickly everyone is drunk and paling around, it just doesn't fit and it doesn't work. The whole genre of these films is dark, disparaging, and sometime disturbing. If their is any humor or positivity to be had, it typically occurs at the very end. Michael C. Hall pretty much has the same dry personality as Dexter, except with a family and a conscious, while Don Johnson is the psychopath who wants to hurt people and thinks it's funny. The bottom line is this film is just a mess of actors who don't belong with each other, characters who should never have gotten along, jumping between scenes that are the complete polar opposites of one another. I liked the story and there are a few interesting moments, but it's just isn't enough to carry the film."" ]"
x-men-days-of-future-past;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \""old timers\"" and the \""new class\"" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!"" ]"
the-purge-anarchy;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""When I saw the trailer for the first Purge movie, I thought it was a wildly innovative idea and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to see the film, unfortunately it amounted to little more than a slasher movie. The story had all the potential in the world, but they really didn't go into it, they just wanted to show off the violence and hatred people had towards one another. I was hoping they would correct this in the sequel and boy did they ever! Anarchy isn't about some family hunkered down in their home, fighting off attackers. In the second installment of the Purge, we learn a lot more about it. The pro and anti-purge factions that exist, the professional companies that make a fortune off that one night, the way the rich purge, and the main story which centers around what happens on the streets when two families are trapped outside on purge night. Two families are easy pickings until they find Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), a man on a mission that he can only complete on Purge night. Barnes however is a man of conscience and won't complete his mission until he begrudgingly gets the families to safety, which means a wild trek through the city. The Purge: Anarchy is a wild ride through a city of ordinary people turned into killers, with home made weapons, booby-traps, and pure anarchy, just as the title promises. If you're looking for action and violence, there are a million places to turn, that's not what the appeal of this movie is. It's the idea, that crime virtually is nonexistent, except for this one night, where society turns on each other. Where almost everyone's craziest fantasy becomes reality and just how some people react. What will each character turn into when they are allowed to do whatever they want? How does society feel about this law and is the benefit worth the cost? This story has just so many directions it can go in, that why I'm not surprised to hear they're working on a fourth film. The Purge series may just be a series of action/slasher films, but this one idea puts a whole new spin on them and makes you see things through a whole different set of eyes and I for one think it's ingenious."" ]"

MacFarlane plays Albert, a sheep farmer, who has a reputation for being a coward. After backing out of one duel, he is forced into another, after falling for a woman he didn't know was married to a psychopath. With Seth MacFarlane, you know there is going to a range of comedy from ingenious to low-brow, but this recent film is completely the latter. It is impressive that he got such a large cast to star beside him, but unfortunately they all have very little comedic experience and it shows. Writing, Directing, Casting, and Starring in a film is an admirable feat, but it is completely wasted when the film is a stupid as this one. If your film is going to be rated R, why not go all the way with it? If you take out the sheep fornicating and the fowl language, A Million Ways To Die In The West, is nothing more than an awful kids movie, full of potty jokes, and misleading heroes. The story here is very simplistic and half the time it's not even funny. The parts that are meant to be humerus, turn out to be little more than jokes for the young teens that watch Family Guy. When I saw this film, I was hoping for another unique MacFarlane comedy, like Ted. That film was hilarious and extremely unique. By comparison, A Million Ways To Die In The West is about fifteen minutes of content, and an hour an half of complete and utter nonsense. I suspect some of the big stars in this cast wish they could remove this film from their IMDB page, because it really was that bad."" ]"

That all changes when a decade later his daughter goes missing. The gloves come off and McGuire connects with his old crew and goes after old enemies to find his daughter. This was an entertaining film, but I think it would have been so much better if it were less violent. I love violent action films as much as the next guy, but the story here calls for a more investigative approach, but all McGuire wants to do is beat people for answers. Nicholas Cage stars and is one of those action stars that never goes out of style. He's been going after the bad guys and surviving impossible odds for nearly three decades, becoming very good at it. Despite being an independent film, Rage has a huge cast with many notable names that really help the story along. In fact, with all the named actors in the film, I'm really surprised that Rage wasn't released in theaters. While being entertaining, Rage isn't anything you haven't seen before, as it's your typical who done it, with all the gun fire and explosions you'd expect from an action movie. The cast is experienced and very good, while the plot does have a back story and moves at a reasonable pace. Rage is one of those film where you don't really have to think and ultimately it is somewhat forgettable, but if you're looking for something to watch without having to think too much, than Rage is a perfect choice and it is currently streaming on Netflix."" ]"

Life seems to be perfect for Mac (Rogen) and his new wife Kelly (Rose Byrne), until they get new neighbors, a fraternity house. They seem like they'll get along okay, until the couple finally calls the police on their neighbors, then all hell breaks loose. This film had all the makings of a great comedy and would have been terrific, if their had been less partying, and more fighting. While there were some extremely funny moments, most of the film either features the eye candy partying or Rogen and Byrne consistently interrupting each other during their long, loud, confusing conversations. This film really was the first time I understood peoples complaints about Rogen, as his rambling and interrupting was just ridiculously over the top. The surprise of the film was easily Zac Efron. I've seen him in several films before and he's good at what he does, usually playing this super attractive, really nice guy, in some love story or teen drama. I can honestly say until this point, I never enjoyed anything he was in, except for 17 Again. This film marks a change in direction for the young stars career and he was really great. Most of the funny moments in this film, actually came not from Rogen, but from Efron. It was great to see, but still not enough to save this film. There is a lot of partying, drinking, pot, and eye candy, but when it comes right down to it, this film really wasn't anything special."" ]"

When global warming has become too much for the planet, top scientist create a cure, a new chemical that will stabilize the planet, however there is a miscalculation leading to a global ice age, which kills off most of the planet. Earth's remaining inhabitants are left stranded on a single luxury train that is forced to continually circle the earth. I understand that this train was a billionaires dream and has this state of the art engine that will last for decades, but why a train? I'd think if the world was ending, these people would put their money into an underground civilization or some super generator for the worlds largest building, because too me, a train doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When the engine fails, you're dead and if the ice causes a derailment or an avalanche crushes the tracks? There are so many things that could go wrong with this idea, that it's virtually impossible, that for 18 years, nothing has gone wrong. Captain America, Chris Evans stars and he is really terrific. I can't believe I never heard of this guy until a couple of years ago. He leads as if he's been doing it for years and Evans is assisted by a unique cast of characters, one stranger than the next, but their goal is all the same, to leave the crowded, filthy, back of the train, for the luxurious front. Every car brings with it new challenges and they must fight for their lives, before they can even worry about their freedom. The fact that this whole movie takes place on a train is intriguing and makes from some pretty unique scenes. Snowpiercer is one of the most imaginative films to come along in a long time and it features a huge cast of talented actors, that span multiple generations and ethnicities. To even my surprise I really enjoyed the film and couldn't wait to see what lay ahead in the next boxcar, but for as much as I liked the film, a thought kept gnawing in the back of my mind, why a train?"" ]"

The heist goes relatively smoothly, but when the team goes to retrieve their money, they discover that one of them double crossed the rest and had stolen the pay day.

As the cartel picks off the team one by one, the remaining members have to ban together to try and stop them, except this time, they have to do it knowing that one of them is a trader. Arnold isn't doing the crazy stunts or fighting scenes that he's become synonymous for, he's in more of a leadership role in this film, but he's still the man when it comes to action films. Here he's paired with the Killing's Mireille Enos, who as the only female member of the team, gives an amazing performance. I'm used to her always playing these quiet, reserved, troubled characters, and it was a real treat to see her break out as the wild girl on a team full of men. Sabotage is the rarest of Action films, as it is one with a great storyline, that is as gripping as any drama. The film isn't just about killing people and blowing things up, it has plenty of that, but in the case of Sabotage, there is a reason for all of it, and this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat."" ]"

The film features a great cast, that made me desperately want to see it, but the problem is that it's a very common tale and it moves along at a snails pace. Even with a story that's been done over and over again, Blood Ties still could have been something special, because of it's cast, but that didn't happen simply because it is one of the most predictable films I've seen all year. The film features two brothers, Chris (Clive Owen) a career criminal, just released from prison, and Frank (Billy Crudup) a New York City Detective, who tries to help Chris get back on his feet. Didn't I see this movie in 2007 when it was called We Own The Night? That film has the exact same tagline, but fortunately wasn't as predictable. Billy Crudup stars as the good brother and was the only interesting character in the film, surprising considering the film features two of my favorite actors, James Caan and Charlie Tahan. Unfortunately neither of them have a particular big or interesting role, as everything centers around these two brothers. The con is played by Clive Owen, who honestly seemed like he didn't want anything to do with this role. He is emotionless, uneven, and every time he has any kind of long dialogue, I thought I was going to fall asleep. The bottom line, one's a cop, the others a con, I wonder what's going to happen? What happens is exactly what you think is going to happen, so why even bother to watch this extreme disappointment?"" ]"
wolf-creek-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""There is a common misconception that Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) was a real person. In fact the character was created from the stories of Australia's most heinous criminals. While the crimes themselves are real, they were committed by a variety of people, not just one man. What made both films work, was the character of Mick Taylor, who while being a horrific serial killer, was still very likeable. Taylor is charismatic and most important of all very funny, and audiences in 2005 ate it up. After the success of the first film, a sequel was immediately planned, but put on hold due to the fact that some of the crimes portrayed in the film, were still being prosecuted in court. The legal issues delayed the film eight years and kept it out of theaters, which is a shame because it was better than the first and received almost no exposure. In the second installment of Wolf Creek, Mick isn't just torturing victims at his dungeon, he's chasing a man through the outback, and when they finally meet, they come to discover that they aren't entirely dissimilar from one another. Ryan Corr (Saw 3D) plays the runner and is just as witty and entertaining as Taylor himself. The chemistry between the too was terrific and gave the series a whole new dynamic, which elevated it to another level. Wolf Creek 2 is so much more intense and at the same time comedic, compared to the first film. It was definitely a risky move by Writer/Director Greg McLean, that really pays off. The Wolf Creek films are no different and no less predictable than any other slasher film. What makes them unique is a character that encompasses the personalities of multiple serial killers and gives the audience the rarest of bad guys, the one that you root for. Even if you don't like slasher films, you may enjoy John Jarratt's extremely strong performance and get a few laughs in between the carnage."" ]"
rob-the-mob;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""1992, small time thugs Thomas and Rosie Uva are tired of knocking over convience stores for peanuts, so one night they come up with an idea, a crazy idea. While scouting locations, Thomas accidentally stumbled upon a mafia owned bar and realized, there's a whole lot of money there and not much protection. For the next year, the duo ripped off the mob without consequence, until they took something that made them both the biggest targets in New York. This is another unbelievably true story, that has been brought to the big screen and the public eye, because of our on-going fascination with organized crime. Mafia movies do so well at the box office, that writers are scrambling to find any story they can turn into a film and it's the audience that has benefited the most. Some people say these movies glorify crime, and maybe they do, but to me, anything Mafia related is just fascinating. Watching these films and hearing these stories, you think how could that have happened? Then you go to Wikipedia and find out it's all true! Rob The Mob is the latest in a bunch of these little known Mafia stories to hit the big screen and it does not disappoint. Who plays a Mafia don better than Andy Garcia? Add to that the intense, Michael Pitt, straight off a successful run in Boardwalk Empire, and you have the makings of a terrific cast. The bottom line, Rob The Mob isn't Goodfellas, but it's a hell of a story, with a cast that's experienced in these types of films. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mafia movie, but if your like me, that doesn't matter much, it's the story and personalities that you're really interested in."" ]"
devils-knot;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The story portrayed in Devil's Knot is the story of the West Memphis 3, a story I am very familiar with. Due to the heinous nature of the crime and the complete incompetence of the local police, the story garnered national attention and has been featured on every news show you can think of. There have also been a ton of documentaries made, all of which I've seen, and all of which call into question who might have really committed these acts. 1993, West Memphis Arkansas, three 8 year old boys go missing in the woods. A huge search party spends 3 days looking for them, before finding them in a popular fishing hole known as the Devil's Knot. There is a big list of suspects, but all the police can see is a group of Satan worshiping teenagers, who have long been a thorn in their sides. Through some very questionable tactics, and a sham of a trial, these teenagers were convicted and sent to prison. From the beginning, there involvement in the crime was called into question, even by the victims families, who saw the injustice of the whole procedure first hand. With my knowledge of the story, I was really interested to see how a film would handle the overwhelming amount of information associated with this case. To my surprise, they didn't do the typical thing and just focus on one aspect of the story, they made the case for the guilt of each of the suspects, and they showed how the police blindly and incompetently when after these three teenagers. As the film goes, they hit the nail right on the head, but when you have all these suspects, and so much back story, squeezed into an hour and a half, it can become extremely confusing for audiences unfamiliar with the case. The film is further harmed by all the interviews and investigation which really slow the pace down. The story of the West Memphis 3 is a tragic one that has led to the freedom of a killer, who did horrible things to three little boys. Devil's Knot is a primary example of police misconduct and the lack of justice available to the less fortunate. If you have an interest, I highly recommend you look into the story and decide for yourself, and a non-bias film covering the events is a great place to start."" ]"
mccanick;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""On the surface, McCanick is a simple story of a cop going after an ex-con who he has a history with. As the film progresses, the lines begin to blur, leaving the audience to question who is really the good guy and who is actually the bad guy? This film is notable, as it is the last thing Glee star Cory Monteith worked on before he died, and it was a definite change in direction for the young star. The story starts on Eugene Wellington McCanick's birthday, a happy day that should mark a reunion with his son, but instead marks a day where he learns that the biggest bust of his career, acquiesced killer Simon Wells (Cory Monteith) had been paroled. McCanick is ordered to leave the situation alone, but he can't rest while this man is on the street and McCanick goes looking for trouble. This is a very dark and methodical drama that really seems to have no depth whatsoever, until you see both sides of the story presented in flashbacks. David Morse stars as your typical tough loner cop, whose life is all about the job. The kind of cop that takes his job personally and will do whatever it takes to bust the people he sees as a threat to his city. When I think tough guy, David Morse is not the first person who comes to mind, but he has a history of playing both the good and the bad guy, making the role of Eugene McCanick perfect for him. He's paired with Cory Monteith, who as a teen heartthrob, has never really been seen as more than a sweet, loveable guy. Simon Wells is anything but sweet an loveable, as he's been severally damaged by a life on the streets, but the question becomes just how bad a guy is he? McCanick is the kind of film where everything seems to be laid right out in front of you, the kind of film where you're not expecting a surprise, but that's the whole premise of the film. The whole purpose of the film is to make you question everything you believe and it really turns into to something very unique and special. McCanick doesn't have a cast or a preview that screams out to you, many people are just going to skip it, but if you do, you'll  be missing that special kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it's over."" ]"
joe;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""In this remake of a 1970 film by the same name, Nicholas Cage plays Joe, an ex-con and unlikely hero to a fifteen year old boy. The story is called Joe, and you'll figure out why by the end, but to be honest, I saw this film more as a coming of age story, with the majority of the focus on Gary (Tye Sheridan). Gary's family is difficult to say the least, both his parents are drug addicts, and it's up to him to earn a living to support his sister. One day while out in the woods, he comes across Joe, a man who owns a lumber company and persuades him to give him a job. Gary is a hard worker who comes to see his boss as more of a father figure than his own father, and when things get bad, he's turns to Joe for help. Joe is no saint though, as he has his own criminal past and is reluctant to get involved. This is one of these really dark, slow moving dramas, where everything may or may not be important to the story. The real action is spaced out, but when something happens, the intensity is off the charts. This film is very similar to, Winter's Bone, which also had a young lead trying to save her siblings. While Tye Sheridan is not Jennifer Lawrence, his more quiet demeanor makes him more likable in the eyes of the viewer. Sheridan is a kid who came out of nowhere to star in the independent film, Mud, and since then has become known for making these super dark, intense films, where he plays a quiet, reserved character that one can't help but root for. Nicholas Cage is equally as good in a role that is more dramatic than most of things he's done lately. That being said, Cage still has it and together with Sheridan make for one of the most interesting and unique films I've seen all year. The story and even the trailer seem to be a little dull, most people will look at this film and see it as too slow and dramatic, and at first, I thought so too, but as the film progresses it just gets better and better, ascending to the level of a must see movie."" ]"
the-monuments-men;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""When I saw the preview for The Monuments Men, I was really excited. I've never been all that crazy about George Clooney, but I love Matt Damon, and the film is based on a little known tale from a famous historic event. Stories like this one, are often turned into some of the best films that Hollywood has to offer, and I was sure this film would be a can't miss. Clooney stars and directs this extremely large and diverse cast, which ultimately turns into it's downfall. When you have a large cast of talent, you need to be very careful about how you use them. In The Monuments Men, the cast is split up all across Europe, leading to short scenes, that jump from location to location far too quickly. When the crew is reunited towards the end, the film becomes much better, and in my opinion, this is how the story should have been told right from the beginning. The story centers around a community of art lovers, who are distraught about the Nazi's theft of historic works of art. As the war is winding down and the Nazis defeat is imminent, these men want to make sure that the worlds greatest works of art are protected, and their willing to risk their lives to do so. As I stated earlier, George Clooney stars and gives his usual performance. When Clooney first started doing movies, he was exciting and really gave audiences their moneys worth, but lately all he does is play the same character over and over again. Clooney is the mysterious, handsome stranger, who does a lot without saying much. Some people love that kind of thing, as for me, I find it to be lazy. If you just wanted to direct, there was more than enough talent to carry this film, and in fact, I would have preferred to see Bill Murray or John Goodman in larger roles. The story told in The Monuments Men is extremely interesting, but it's told in these fast paced, short scenes, that do nothing but confuse the audiences and squander the extreme amount of talent this film has to offer. Needless to say, while I thought the film was a great idea, I was far from impressed."" ]"

This story was so popular, that it's become an entire series, one that Koontz has worked on almost exclusively since it's release. This unique story focuses on a unique man, with a unique name. Odd (Anton Yelchin) is a short order cook in a small California town, where he lives a relatively normal life with his girlfriend, Stormy. Odd is no different than any other twenty-something in town,  except for the fact that he sees the dead, specifically people who died prematurely and under suspicious circumstances. They can't talk to him, but the spirits lead Odd to the evidence he needs to find the truth. When a strange man comes to town, the spirits lead Odd to be suspicious, and with good cause. Anton Yelchin stars and once again shows off his loveable charisma. There is something about him that makes Yelchin the guy that everyone wants to be friends with, an ability that comes across in every character he plays. Odd is no different, as he is this complete weirdo, but with an innocent quality, that just makes people want to like him. Here he's more than just a lovable goofball, but he's also an unofficial detective and hero, that people turn to in there time of need. Everyone knows he's weird, but few know his secret, one of those being the Chief of Police, played by the legendary Willem Dafoe. Dafoe usually portrays the bad guy, and it was interesting to see him take on a different challenge. Odd Thomas is smart and extremely well written, with a terrific cast, that really brings the story alive with their own unique style. The story may seem like it's a little out there, but it's not just science fiction, it's a story that crosses many genres and has something for everyone, an easy choice for our list of must see movies!"" ]"

Not wanting to convict an innocent man, Brockden blows the case, but afterwards finds out that the wounds on the man he hit, were not consistent with being hit by a car, and match the wounds of seven unsolved homicide victims. Now Brockden must find out if he mistakenly let a serial killer go free. Reasonable Doubt, unlike many similar films, actually had a unique and original story. Both Dominic Cooper and Samuel L. Jackson were terrific, and the film really could have been the hidden gem of the year, but only got 3.5 stars. The reason is simple, while it was a great story, it was far too predictable to be what it could have been. I really it hate when the Writers assume that the audience is too dumb to figure out what's going on. That's what happens here, while the story is tremendous, everything is laid out in such a way, that even a child would know what would happen next. Aside from that, the great story and terrific cast make for an exciting film, that was quite enjoyable, but it was just predictable to a fault."" ]"
homefront;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When you combine Action with Drama, you had better have a damn good story to go along with the tremendous fight scenes and wild chases, or else you get a film that falls flat. We all know that at this point, Jason Statham is the best Action star you could have, but the jury was out on how effect he could be in a more dramatic role. In Home Front, Statham plays a retired undercover D.E.A. agent, who has recently become a single father. He and his daughter have moved from the big city to the small town, which his late wife called home, in the hopes of building a better life. Everything was going as planned until his daughter, stood up to a bully at school, and embarrassed the son of one the towns most influential families. The simple misunderstanding between children quickly escalates into an all out war, which will force Statham to use everything he learned in the D.E.A. to protect his daughter and his new home. Once again, Jason Statham was terrific in this film. It is mind boggling and seems to be impossible, but every film this man does is better than the one before it. He is on a winning streak, the likes of which I have never seen. Statham was terrific, but oddly, he's paired with an actor who doesn't have much experience playing the bad guy and it showed. James Franco plays Gator Bodine, a small time hood and drug trafficker, who goes after Statham with everything he's got, the only problem is, Bodine really isn't that bad a guy. In fact, when Franco starts cursing and playing all tough, it's almost laughable, not to mention the fact that he doesn't have a tenth of the fighting skills that Statham has. Being that this was a big budget film, Written by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky),  Directed by Gary Fleder (Kiss The Girls, Runaway Jury), and starting the best action star in the game (Jason Statham), it's very peculiar that they would choose a bad guy, who is best known as a comedic actor. While the story was great, Franco simply can not match up with Statham at all. Homefront has almost everything you could want in a Thriller, but the lack of a strong, believable opponent, really calls into question just how believable the film is and makes it somewhat predictable."" ]"
jamesy-boy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I have always been a huge fan of real life drama, because lets face it, some of this stuff you just can't make up. Even the best writers couldn't imagine some of the things these people have had to endure, and it makes for some amazing films. On the otherside of that, there are other stories, which just aren't that unique or interesting, and in my opinion really don't warrent a full length feature film, Jamesy Boy is an example of this. James (Spencer Lofranco) is your typical rebellious kid from a single parent home. He's not poor and has a lot of opportunities, but for whatever reason, he's turned to drugs and crime. He's living the gangsta life on the streets until the inevitable happens, and he winds up in jail. Once there, James witnesses a crime, and meets a man who helps him unlock a talent he never knew he had, but will James turn to the straight and narrow or will his friends pull him back into his old life? This is a true story and newcomer Spencer Lofranco was fantastic, but haven't we seen stories like this done over and over again? To be honest the only reason I kept watching it was to see which path James chose after prison. I wanted to see how his life turned out, but either way, we've seen films like this many times before and Jamesy Boy doesn't stand out in any type of significant way. If you want to do a film that has been done over and over again, true story or not, there has to be something about it that makes it stand out from the pack, and that doesn't happen here. The bottom line, Jamesy Boy is decent and it's fine if you're just looking to kill a couple of hours. It features a pretty good up and coming young talent and some old familiar faces, but beyond that, there's nothing really special about it."" ]"
kill-your-darlings;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Occasionally I come across a movie that I don't like, but not because it's a bad film. Somethings are not for everyone, but I can still appreciate the terrific performances and unique storyline of Kill Your Darlings. This film follows the early lives, and some previously untold stories, of the 1940's Beat Generation. People like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, & William S. Burroughs are featured prominently in this film, and show what some of America's greatest writers were like when they were mere college students. The story centers mainly around Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan),  who was better than any of them, and could have also been one of the greats, if it wasn't for an event that changed his life forever. The story is a gripping drama, telling a true, untold story from the 1940's, so what's not to like? There was a lot of focus on Philosophy, Art, Poetry and Love. There are some people that really that stuff up, but it just really wasn't for me. DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe were both terrific, but I'll always have a problem seeing Radcliffe playing anyone except for Harry Potter, and when Radcliffe was in a rather graphic sex scene, I admit I had to avert my eyes. The bottom line is that Kill Your Darlings isn't a bad film, but it's very philosophic and somewhat slow moving. I can see how some people are going to absolutely love it, but I just found it slow and a bit too artistic for my liking."" ]"

During a secret meeting, a mob boss gives his hit man a seemingly easy job. Pick up a bag, go to a motel in the middle of nowhere, and wait there until the boss comes to pick it up. The hit man does as he's told and gets a room at this motel, which is not only in the middle of nowhere, but is also filled with a group of ridiculously strange people, who all want this mysterious bag. John Cusack stars and no matter the role or the film, he's always fun to watch. There is just something about him that always makes his films entertaining and it's a good thing, especially in a film like this. While Cusack is along for the ride, it is very hard to follow along and like what you're seeing, because the film is just so bizarre. The cast of characters coming for this secret bag, include a pimp, a Russian midget, a corrupt sheriff, and a very weird guy in a wheelchair just to name a few. As the night wears on it becomes harder and harder to protect this bag, and in the end, when the bag is finally opened, you'll realize, that you just wasted 90 minutes for that!? I admire anything John Cusack does, De Niro is always terrific as a gangster, and if nothing else, The Bag Man is unique, but not for it's story.

Rarely do you see an actor cast in a role, that is absolutely perfect for them, but the lead role of Russell Baze fits Christian Bale like a glove. I have never seen Bale fit more easily into a role or take charge of a story the way he does here. Russell is an ex-con and the shame of his family. As Russell rots away in jail, his little brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), has to take care of his ailing father, and try to keep Russell's wife from leaving him. When Russell finally gets out of jail, Rodney, an amateur fighter,  finally gets the chance to leave the rust belt and earn some real money. Rodney appears on his way to doing just that, when he disappears in a notoriously brutal part of the mountains, leaving his brother alone to try and do the right thing. Along the lines of Winter's Bone, Joe, & Mud, Out of The Furnace is another dark, rural thrillers, that is all the rage in Hollywood these days, and while there are a lot of wannabes and copy-cats, when someone figures out the correct formula you end up with a gem like this. The writing here is Oscar worthy and the character development is everything I crave in a film. Out of The Furnace is under two hours long, but when it's done, I feel as though I know the characters in the same was as if I'd just watched 100 episodes of some TV show. I felt their emotions, I was empathetic to their situations, and I was on the edge of my seating waiting to see what would happen next. These are all marks of a great film, and while I don't really care for Christian Bale, he really has never been better."" ]"

Knoxville does his usual schtick, crashing into to things, saying outrageous things to strangers, and of course showing off his giant rubber testicles. As with most of the Jackass stuff, it's outrageous and hilarious for the first half hour, but quickly gets old. Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate Jackass anymore, but when I start out watching one of their films, I love it, and by the end, I'm just waiting for it to be over with. Knoxville is impressive, and while he's done films on his own, I think he was giving a message to the rest of the group in this film. The message being, if you guys don't want to do this anymore, I can make it work with anyone, even a 10 year old kid. Hopefully the message gets through and we'll get some more Jackass films. I really do love the simplistic comedic genius of the films, but it's repetitive nature makes anything more than an episode of the show wear on me. Maybe it's just not made for someone in my age group anymore, but regardless of age, Jackass has always been good for a few laughs and Bad Grandpa is no exception."" ]"

I was one of those kids and I absolutely loved the story. In fact I continued on with the books and they became unbearably strange. How they got almost 20 novels out of it is beyond me. While I was really excited to finally see Ender's Game on the big screen, I knew the chances of it continuing past one film would be slim at best. It all has to do with the ending, which is bizarre and really shouldn't have been continued. For those who don't know the story, in the future, Earth is at war with an alien species known as the Formics.

That child turns out to be Ender Wiggin, a child who under Earth's new Government, shouldn't have even been born. Seeing the story I read so many years ago, come to life on the big screen, was magical for me. Finally I was able to understand the parts that were just too confusing to see in my head and get the complete picture. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who somewhat miraculously, at the age of 15, has had the starring role in every film he's been in. After watching Ender's game it's not hard to see why, he was to this film, what Ender was to the Human's in the story. The producers surrounded him and his young crew with a cast of Academy Award winners including Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis, which ultimately strengthen the movie and must of really inspired this kid to give the performance he gave. While the film simply broken even at the box office, (killing any chance of a franchise developing out of it) it was very well done and closely mirrored the book. They did a near perfect job of deciding what parts should stay and what should be eliminated, giving us a film that was just as good as the book, if not better."" ]"
2-guns;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""...and the surprise winner of the year goes to 2 Guns! The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns! I can't recommend it enough."" ]"
red-2;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""In 2010, DC Comics introduced the world to one of it's lesser known series, R.E.D. (Retired Extremely Dangerous). What I loved about that film was that it took old school action stars and put them into a modern action movie. The expectations for action movies are much higher today, no longer are they just chases, explosions, and gun fights. Today, people expect action films to have some kind of story, characters with personality, and even some humor. RED delivered all that and more and so does it sequel. Even though there are some bigger names in RED's second installment, the humor didn't play as big a role as it did previously and the story moved a lot faster. To some, this may have been a good thing, but for me, too much happened too quickly. I liked it better when we didn't know the characters or what to expect from them, when things were explained, and not just delved into. The first film made RED seem very original, but it's sequel really does play like a story that was adapted from a comic. Don't get me wrong though, while the second film doesn't compare to the first, it is still far better than some of the other action films released lately. You really can't go wrong in having an action film that stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, they seem to just be oblivious to the signs of aging and are as believable today as they were in their prime. Alone, this pair would have been terrific, but you add true legends of the screen like Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirran to the cast, and honestly, I don't see how any movie fan would want to miss that! The acting is terrific and the story, while proceeding much too quickly, was still a pretty interesting one. I did really enjoy RED 2, my only wish is that they had slowed things down a little and let us catch our breathe."" ]"
prisoners;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Prisoners is a prime example of why I will never understand Hollywood. You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before it was even released, yet for some reason they had to make it nearly three hours long. If there was enough story for a three hour film, then I'd be all for it, but Prisoners has a good 45 minutes worth of repetitiveness, that does nothing to help the movie, in fact, it takes something away from the film. The story begins on Thanksgiving, when two little girls go outside to play and disappear. Feeling that the police aren't doing enough to find the kids, one father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Hugh Jackman stars in a role I wouldn't have imagined him playing in a million years. Based on his other roles and what I know about the man, this doesn't even seem like the kind of role he'd be interested in, but he gives one of the strongest performances I've seen all year, I really didn't know he had that in him. Jackman is paired by Jake Gyllenhaal, another guy who I couldn't see playing a tough as nails police detective, but he too surprised, giving a very strong performance. The cast isn't the problem and the story isn't the problem, what bothered me about this film was how much of it was unnecessary. Did we really need dozens of scenes with Jackman and Dano or all the talk and sadness amongst the families? This was a great all-around movie, but it was so long, that by the end, I'd stopped caring about what was happening and just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film for a unique twist on classic story, great performances from an unlikely cast, and the work of a Director who his known around the world for his signature style, but just a word of caution. Prisoners is a very long film, that at many points seems to go around in circles. When they eventually do get to the point, it's outstanding, but it takes a while to get there."" ]"
parkland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Based on Vincent Bugliosi's book, Four Days in November, the film Parkland chronicles the events following the assassination of JFK. What I liked about this film was how it tells a part of the story that isn't widely known. From the doctors at the hospital, working on the President, to the acquisition of the Zapruder film, Parkland goes behind the scenes to tell the untold story. I was also impressed with how the film managed to stick to the facts and not dwell on any of the conspiracy theories that surround the case. Zac Efron stars and really wasn't all that great. I think that Efron needs to stick to what he does best, taking his cloths off and making people laugh. While the film is kind of slow, I really enjoyed Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Abraham Zapruder, the man who filmed the assassination. Zapruder really struggled with releasing the tape to the media and the events he witnessed ultimately destroyed his life. Giamatti's portrayal of the man is supposedly spot on and truly deserves an honor mention. Parkland gives us a lot of new information about the events that followed the assassination of President Kennedy, but a lot of it are things the general public really aren't that interested in learning about. For a Kennedy aficionado, this film must of been eye opening, as for the rest of us, it was an interesting, non-bias view of history, albeit a little boring."" ]"
the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""For those of you who didn't read the book, City of Bones, this movie may seem a bit confusing to you. This film is kind of like a cliff notes version of the book. Certainly they had to cut things out of the nearly 500 page novel, but some key moments are simply touched upon with a line or two, making the movie a bit confusing at times. Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal girl, who for some reason can't stop drawing a symbol. When she starts asking about the symbol, she is pulled into a world she never knew existed. As it turns out, Clary is keeping secrets, secrets she doesn't even know she has. It's those secrets that will eventually put her life, and the lives of everyone she knows, in danger. At first, the two main characters seem like they are completely different and won't have any chemistry at all, but as time goes on, they learn they're more alike than they think. Once their on the same page, the story really takes off. Lily Collins (Abduction, The Blind Side) really takes hold of her character and gives the film a strong female lead, that rivals Katniss Everdeen. Collins is paired with British heart-throb, Jamie Campbell Bower, who is a lot more than eye candy. I'd never seen Bower in anything, except bit parts in Twilight and Harry Potter, but the guy has some serious fighting skills. Bower is another one who at first doesn't seem to fit, but in the end really helps to make this film something special. To answer the big question about City of Bones, no, it is not as good as the book and you really shouldn't have expected it to be. The novel is massive and has entire parts that simply couldn't be transferred to the big screen. Some things were left out that shouldn't have been, while some of the more fast paced scenes were extended for the screen. All in all, I thought this movie was a pretty good representation of an excellent novel and a great film to include in your next movie night."" ]"
the-frozen-ground;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I find that the best thrillers come from films that are based on real life events. Some of these stories are just so twisted and crazy, that even the best writer wouldn't be able to imagine them on their own. The story told in the film The Frozen Ground, is one such story, telling the world about serial killer, Robert Hansen. From the 1970s until 1983, Hansen was one of the nations most prolific serial killers. What makes Hansen's story unique is that he was able to do all this, without the police even connecting the cases, because of where he lived. Hansen's story begins in Anchorage Alaska, where he began preying on prostitutes. After torturing and killing them, he would dump the bodies in remote, unpopulated areas of Alaska, where they were ravaged by the weather and wild animals. This made finding the cause of death or even identifying the victims nearly impossible. Hansen would probably still be active today, if it wasn't for Cindy Paulson, the only victim in 12 years, to escape the madman, and that's where our film begins. Nicholas Cage stars as Jack Halcombe, a state police detective who comes up with a wild theory that all these missing people and strange deaths, could be connected. Halcombe has a tough time convincing anyone of this, especially since his only witness is a drug abusing prostitute. Nicolas Cage excels in movies like this and is again terrific. Cage was born to play a cop and in my opinion does it better than anyone else out there. In this film, he's paired with Zac Efron's ex, Vanessa Hudgens, who wasn't great, but was much better than I expected. It's difficult to make the transition from Disney cover girl to a legitimate movie star, but I'd say that Hudgens is well on her way. Finally, John Cusack rounds out this all-star cast, playing Robert Hansen. After all the films I've seen Cusack in, I really couldn't imagine him as the bad guy, but his performance is what really helps this movie stand out, and hopefully will lead him to other similar roles. The Frozen Ground is a little slow, but it is supposedly very accurate, and tells an interesting story that most people know nothing about. It's the kind of film that I really go for and hopefully you will too."" ]"

They are lazy, usually have no storyline, and the constant camera movement is just nauseating. Europa Report is different, as the film is told through surveillance cameras, aboard a state of the art space ship. Europa is a privately funded mission to the sixth moon of Saturn, to investigate strange heat signatures detected by NASA, that could be alien lifeforms. The cinematography was better than most of these film, and there was somewhat of a back story, however Europa Report is really not much different than a million other similar films. Nothing really happens until they reach their destination, they find something strange, and then must decide if fighting for their lives is worth the potential for scientific discovery. I bet you can name a dozen other films that were similar. As for the cast, they were just like film, in that they were very average, with little to nothing of note. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and I'm always hoping these films will show me something new and excited, but as with Apollo 18, Mission To Mars, Sunshine, and Moon, I was extremely disappointed. Europa Report wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't unique in any way. If you haven't seen many films, you may be wowed by something like this, but if you're like me, all you're going to find is a very boring and unimaginative film."" ]"

His cold, callous style and willingness to do anything, earned him the nickname, The Iceman. In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out."" ]"

As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere near as good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected."" ]"

For 12 hours, once a year, all crime is legal and people are given the opportunity to release their hatred and rage on anyone they can find. The cast isn't important to a film like this, it's all about the writers cynical message, that behind every smile is jealousy, behind every hand shake is anger, and trust has become a luxury that no one can afford. This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any rapes or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into. The Purge is definitely all about the authors agenda and it is somewhat predictable, but what made the film for me, was the terrific ending, which really does give the audience the chance to challenge the cynical nature of the film."" ]"

There are a ton of bodies that are so badly mutilated, that they can't even tell if their victims are male or female. There is also an overwhelming lack of evidence, that is except for one small mini-cam found amongst the ruble. Evidence was one of those films that wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either. There is enough going on that you will keep watching it and you will be glad you did! Watching as many movies as I do, I tend to figure things out pretty quickly, and I was sure I had this film figured out early on. As I got to the end of the film, I was sure I knew what happened, and I was somewhat disappointed at the predictable story. Then, the writers throw a huge twist into the plot that you will never see coming and it really makes the whole film. Evidence quickly becomes one of those films that will keep you thinking about it long after the credits role, and too me, that is the best kind of movie. No one of name really stars in this film and there really aren't any stand out performances, it's just one of those movies that stands on a strong story. I usually hate these cheaply made, found footage films. The plots are lazy and they rely on cheap scares and effects to make people jump, but Evidence wasn't like that. The film starts off really slowly, but gets better and better leading up to an ending that no one will ever see coming.

This film had all the makings of a terrific action movie, but that's not what we got. For over an hour, we watch the story of Jim's life slowly pass us by. What should have taken 25 minutes, takes up almost the entirety of the film, it was absolutely ridiculous! We meet Jim and his family, see what the issues are, and then, nothing for quite a while. Prison Break's Dominic Purcell stars in this thing and he is one of the best young action stars they could have gotten to star in this movie. It just really drives me crazy to see how obtuse the writers of these films can be. The lead character was cast, almost to perfection, while at the same time, you have a relatively good story to build upon, yet the film goes nowhere! By the time anything actually happened here, I was already fed up and disinterested. Assault On Wall Street looked like it was going to be a can't miss action/thriller. Instead, bad directing and perfectionist writers just completely destroy everything they have going for them and deliver a film that eventually becomes unwatchable."" ]"
would-you-rather;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""A really good independent Horror film is worth it's weight in gold. Finding that diamond in the rough makes the hours of sitting through low budget garbage, well worth it. For me, Would You Rather is that diamond, as it is one of the most imaginative Horror films to come along in years. Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) is an eccentric millionaire, who wants to help people that are down on their luck, except there's a catch. With a large sum of money at stake, Lambrick invites several down on their luck people to his mansion, where they must play a game in order to win, a deviously twisted game. Would you rather stab yourself or a complete stranger? Would you rather take a razor blade to your eyeball or cut off your own finger? These are some of the challenges involved in this game, which sees the winner go home rich and the losers in worse shape then when they started. Jeffrey Combs of Star Trek fame stars and was absolutely the perfect choice to play the sadistic millionaire. In all his roles he has this crazy twisted side, behind the mask of a very likeable guy. In this film he is paired with the beautiful Brittany Snow, who is there to help her sick brother. As it turns out, she is the logical one, who tries to match wits with Lambrick, making for some terrific dialogue. Would You Rather is creepy and graphic, just when you think you have it all figured out, the story takes a twist, and you're back into the satanic paradise. This film is everything I look for in Horror and will definitely be included in my 2015 Halloween Horrorfest, and it should absolutely be considered for yours."" ]"

It was destine to become a movie, especially now, with the popularity of zombies, but ultimately, the highly anticipated film fails to deliver anything different. U.N. Employee, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), is out with his family when a recently discovered virus hits the United States and all hell breaks loose. The first 45 minutes of this film were literally like the pilot of The Walking Dead. No one knows what's going on, people are panicking, it was all very predictable. The film does go into a different direction after that, but how many different ways of doing a zombie film are there? Lane starts traveling the world seeking a cure for the disease, while at the same time trying to avoid being attacked. The unfortunate fact is that no matter how good the acting or the writing, there is very little you can actually do with a zombie film. The zombies and the circumstances behind the outbreak are always a little different, but ultimately it becomes about survival or the race to find a cure. Brad Pitt is terrific, and as I have been saying for year, it doesn't matter how good looking the guy is, he belongs in action films! This is the genre where he excels and even though World War Z was painfully predictable, Pitt makes it worth watching. He is the focus of the story and it takes a lot of quick thinking and tremendous stunts to keep him alive. For me that was the best part of the film. There was a lot of hype behind World War Z and it was a very intense film, but like I said, there is very little you can do with an end of the world/zombie film that hasn't been done over and over again. While some what entertaining, World War Z is ultimately just another copy cat."" ]"

The film is broken up into three stories, starring three different actors, and it all comes together at the end. The film is about two men, one is a criminal, the other is a cop, and both have a decision to make. One makes the right choice, the other makes the wrong one, and fifteen years later, both decisions have a huge impact on their children, who come together in High School. Each part features a different actor, Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, and Dane DeHann. While they were all terrific, it's Cooper who really stands out. I thought he was good in Limitless, but he blows that performance away, giving an Oscar worthy portrayal. Due to the violent nature of the film, of course the Academy overlooked him, but you will be hard pressed to find a better performance all year. He was magically and is the thread that connects the stories. Without Cooper being at his best, this film probably wouldn't have worked out as well as it did. There are so many supporting stars and the story becomes so much more complex than it appears to be. Watching The Place Beyond The Pines was really like seeing three different short plays, that are loosely tied together, but don't make much of an impact until you see the fourth and final act. Once you see the whole picture, you will be blown away, both by the magnitude of the story and an unexpected conclusion. The cast and previews for this film really didn't excite me that much, but the reviews were strong, I gave it a chance, and what I found was another must see movie."" ]"

After some success with films like the Marine and 12 Rounds, the company earned some legitimacy and with it comes bigger talent and better Directors. The Call is the first WWE film that doesn't star a wrestler, and it was every bit as good as any Hollywood thriller that was released last year. Halle Berry stars as a 911 operator, whose worse nightmare is realized, when a kidnapping victim calls in from the trunk of a serial killers car. From there, the Call becomes 90 minutes of pure, non-stop intensity. It's hard to imagine a film that features a girl in a trunk and a woman in a call center, being as entertaining as it was, but that's where the experienced Hollywood talent comes into play. Halle Berry is not someone I consider to be a terrific actress, but she surprised me, by playing a character who had to overcome emotion and think on her feet. It quickly becomes evident that going by the book will lead to this girls death, and the operator comes up with some pretty novel ideas about how to deal with the situation. The supporting cast, which does feature an active WWE superstar, is also very good in assisting with the statewide manhunt. This film was really on pace to be one of my favorite films of the year until the ending. It was very strange, but the film gets to a certain point and then just ends. There may not have been much more of the story to tell, but the way it ended made me feel like I left the theater a few minutes early to answer an important phone call or something. It maybe a small thing to some, but to me, it really took a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. The Call is not that original, outside of the particular situation, it's a type of film you've seen many times over. It is however intense, fast paced, very entertaining, and most definitely worth the price of admission."" ]"

Once inside, the aliens replace their humans consciousness for their own purposes, but some are able to resist this process and even control their alien host. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is one of those people, and while she can't rid herself of the alien presents inside of her, she can control it. Saoirse Ronan stars and it is great to finally see her in a movie that is worth while. Ronan is one of the top young actresses in Hollywood, but she keep playing roles like Hanna, in terrible films that do little more than to allow her to show off her talent. In those films, she was the only thing worth watching, so putting her in a film that's actually good, really gave her the opportunity to shine and she was amazing. Ronan played the role of Melanie, trapped in her own body but also played the alien Wanda that was inside of her. Once gaining control of Wanda, Melanie seeks out her family, which are part of the resistance. He main love interest is played by Max Irons, who was also terrific. Known more as a model and background character, this was really one of his first starring roles, and he was fantastic, playing a man caught between his love for this girl and his hatred for the alien inhabiting her. The Host has it all, an alien race, chasing a fugitive on the run, leading up to a major dilemma, wrapped inside a love story. Silverberg's Passenger is a favorite of mine and I knew with Andrew Niccol at the helm that this was going to be a good film, but I had no idea how innovative and intense the story would be, and for that, The Host is the latest film to join our list of must see movies."" ]"

I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical."" ]"

Robinson wasn't the best black player out there, he wasn't even a superstar, what he was, was well educated and understood that people attacked him out of fear and ignorance. He never took it personally and knew fighting back would accomplish nothing, and against all odds, no matter what was thrown at him, Robinson was able to brush it off. In 42, he's portrayed by newcomer Chadwick Boseman, who wasn't just fantastic, but also gracious for the opportunity to portray a true American hero. I am a big Jackie Robinson fan and through everything I've seen, Boseman has given the most clear and accurate portrayal of the man to date. His co-star is Harrison Ford, playing the legendary Branch Ricky. Throughout his life, Ricky was outspoken against segregation and didn't just help in breaking baseball's color barrier, eight years later, he broke the Latino barrier as well. What I love about Harrison Ford is that he's so predictable, you know you will always get a tremendous performance out of him and that he will go to extreme lengths to be as real to the story as possible. This film was outstanding, from top to bottom, but my one knock on 42 is that it didn't go beyond the 1947 season. Robinson played for nine years after that and was a key member of the civil rights movement after baseball. I would have liked to have seen how in 1955, at age 36, he led the Dodgers to their only championship in Brooklyn, with an improbably steal of home against the Yankees. I also would have liked to have seen how he became the first black broadcaster, or how he marched with Dr. King in Washington. 42 is one of the clearest, most accurate depiction of two years in the life of Jackie Robinson, and while it was terrific, I would have like to have seen them take it a step further."" ]"

If you took the cast of the original Die Hard and had them re-shoot the movie, scene by scene, at the White House, you'd have Olympus Has Fallen. Normally I find Fuqua's take on the action genre, refreshing and original, but you wouldn't know it by watching this film. It is freaky how similar this film was to Die Hard, they even have some of the same twist, goals, types of terrorist, all that's missing is a short fat cop and a hand radio. Don't get me wrong, I did find the movie entertaining and Gerard Butler has really stepped up and taken the reigns as the lead you want in your action film. The effects are terrific and unlike Die Hard, this film has a ton of big named stars in it, that really do give the film some teeth. Olympus Has Fallen was a great idea, with a ton of stars, and the right Director. The film made a ton of money and gave us action junkies the edge of your seat entertainment we crave.

Gangster Squad is based on a novel and is about an off the books LAPD operation aimed at bringing down Micky Cohen. In the 1940s, LA had a growing mafia problem on it's hands, and Mickey Cohen was set to become the next Al Capone. Unbeknownst for decades, the LAPD sent a group of cops, who didn't play by the book, after Cohen and by going after his business interests, they attempt to destroy his growing empire. The story is a great one, well deserving of a film adaptation, but what people didn't like was how it turned into an action film. This story has all the makings of an epic mafia drama, an you will be hard pressed to find a better performance than the one Sean Penn gives as Mickey Cohen. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't get more into Cohen and his operation, but for what it was, it was a great film. As for the cast, it features some of Hollywood's best an brightest as old school meets the up and coming stars of the big screen. Every one from the stars to the ancillary characters give Oscar worthy performances that will be sadly overlooked. because of the nature of the film. If you're looking for a classic mob drama, you're going to be disappointed, but if you want to see an action packed cop movie with a mob element, then Gangster Squad is the film for you."" ]"

The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name. Cruise actually does a decent job and was very believable, as was the story, but the one major drawback for me was just how little was left to the imagination."" ]"

This crazed man in a mask is looking to collect certain types of people and if they pass his test, they can join his collection. If they fail, they become experiments in human suffering. In the first film, we see career criminal, Arkin O'Brien, fighting for his life. In the sequel, we see Arkin escape and lead a band of mercenaries back to the Collectors hideout, in order to rescue a captured rich girl. Of course once they get there, they find a maze of terror that rivals any film you've ever seen. I thought some of the machines in the Saw films were clever, but until you see this film, you haven't seen anything yet! How people come up with these things is beyond rational thought. Of all the ways to torture people, to come up with machines and techniques that exceed everything we've seen before is just sick...sick and very cool. The cast is the same as in every Horror movies, a bunch of dumb, no named actors, following a couple of smart people in order to stay alive as long as they can. What's special here is the story, the affects, and the level of depravity. The Collection is one of the most violent and gruesome Horror films to come along in years. It's the first step in the evolution of Horror that fans have been waiting for for years."" ]"
parental-guidance;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Now days, Billy Crystal doesn't appear in films as often as he used to, but for the right project and cast, he's always willing to remind us of why he's a household name. It doesn't matter if it's a raunchy comedy or a family film, his quirky and unique sense of humor always makes whatever he stars in that much more enjoyable and Parental Guidance is no different. On the surface, this is just another family comedy about Grandma and Grandpa getting in over their heads when they agree to babysit for the weekend. Add Crystal and Bette Midler to that and all of a sudden the film is taken to a whole other level. Everyone knows what to expect from both Crystal and Midler, but the real magic is their chemistry and how they play off each other, especially when you throw three unpredictable kids into the mix. Some of the scenes with the grandparents trying to use the modern technology or the kids taking advantage of the grandparents lack of respect for their parents strict instructions are truly laugh out loud funny. Yes, that's exactly what I said, it's a PG rated family movie, but it has more than a couple of laugh out loud moments. Parental Guidance is a film that the parents and grandparents will want to see for it's terrific cross-generational cast, but the kids will enjoy it too, for both it's old school and modern humor. It's the perfect rainy day weekend family feature film."" ]"

They get new jobs and reconnect with family on their journey toward becoming a more mature couple, but it comes at a cost. Judd Apatow writes and directs this unique comedy, so I was expecting another hilarious winner, but they can't all be winners. The cast is fantastic and there are more than a few good laughs here, but this movie is extremely long and drawn out for a romantic comedy, and while it starts out strong, it starts to grow tiresome. There are many scenes between husband and wife that are boring and completely unnecessary. What I did like was how Apatow cast his daughters to be Pete and Debbie's daughters. They really are sisters and there was no pressure working for their dad, allowing them to really make it seem like this is a real family, and it's a good thing too, because for as good as both Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are, they just didn't have much chemistry together. Both cast members were good in portraying their own characters, but when you put them together you see that something just isn't right about the pairing. I loved the concept and you will definitely laugh during this film, but it does lack a certain chemistry and is far too long for what it is."" ]"
alex-cross;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""As a long time fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, I thought Morgan Freeman was the perfect choice to play Cross, and I loved Kiss The Girls. I was weary of a remake, especially one done by Tyler Perry, but to my surprise he was much better than expected, unfortunately, the film was not. Alex Cross has always been about beating criminals with his mind. The forensic psychologist is best known for his ability to out think rather than over power his opponents, but you'd never know it by watching this film. Alex Cross and his team are called in on a triple homicide, but the suspect had more on his mind then just his targets, and sets his sights on Cross and the team. There is a heavy focus right from the beginning on the bad guy, who we immediately see is Matthew Fox. To me this took all the mystery right out of the story, and instead of being a who done it, the film was about how to catch the bad guy. The writers didn't do that right either, as Alex Cross is blinded by rage and goes out guns blazing to fight and kill the assailant. While this may make for an exciting action film, it's not who or what Alex Cross is all about, and despite all the novels I've read, I felt like I didn't know the characters at all. Tyler Perry stars as Cross and shows that he's more than just a comedian dressed as an old woman. Perry was very intense and likeable, under different circumstances I would have really enjoyed his performance, but again, he wasn't playing the Alex Cross I know. He's paired with Lost's Matthew Fox, who has played the bad guy before. I love Fox as an actor, but he just doesn't have the look or temperament of a killer and wasn't very believable here. Alex Cross is one of my all time favorite characters, and the first time they put him on film, they did it right. The second time, wasn't one of Patterson's better stories, but still very well done. This time, Alex Cross has turned into John McLean, and while some people will love it, to me it just emphasized everything that is wrong with Hollywood today."" ]"

It was always believed that a comedy, featuring a mostly female cast, would only work as a buddy comedy. No one ever thought that women would ever be able to successful pull off a raunchy comedy, until Bridesmaids came along and changed all that. For A Good Time, Call... is from the same writers and producers as Bridesmaids and may even be funnier. The story begins with Lauren (Lauren Anne Miller) being dumped by her long time fiancee. On her own, Lauren can't afford the upscale apartment she's been living in, and is forced to move in with Katie, a promiscuous, pill popping OCD, who she'd only met once before, at a party, where Katie threw up on her. At first, the hostility is off the charts, but when Lauren loses her dream job, she is forced to help Katie run her business, a phone sex line. This film is not for the faint of heart, as it is very raunchy, to the point of shocking even me, someone who thinks they've seen it all. While this may seem like a great thing, the truth is, as with most single themed comedies, the longer it goes, the less funny it gets. At first, seeing the things these girls were saying and the people they were talking to was hilarious, but after an hour of  this film, it just really wasn't all the funny anymore. Both the female leads are terrific and they are the reason this film works. For A Good Time, Call... is very raunchy and very funny, but it has one centralized theme and doesn't deviate from it much at all. If not for the amazing young ladies who star in it, this film would have got tiresome a lot more quickly then it did. For a good time watch this movie, it's way out there, but some parts are truly hysterical."" ]"

Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, so I was going to see it either way, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing. This man brings such a strong presents to everything that he does, that often times I find myself overlooking the entire rest of the cast. There are a lot of big names in this film, that all become forgettable after the performance Washington gives. Even though this film came out at the wrong time, if he doesn't receive the Academies attention for this role, then there is a gaping flaw in their system. The story is fantastic, Denzel Washington is nothing short of amazing, and this story will stick with you long after the film is over, I can not recommend it enough!"" ]"

Police work comes with natural real life drama and action, in this instance the script really does write itself, so I was okay with it being used for a film like this. I just wish it had been done more naturally. I understand that the film takes place in a gang infested area of L.A. and that they needed to make it more dramatic and action packed for it to succeed in theaters, but you talk about going over the top. That's where Director, David Ayer comes in, after all gangs and going over the top are his specialty. End of Watch does have some great chase scenes and some really cool moments between partners, but for the most part it's just one non-stop explosion filled gun battle after another, making Los Angeles look like Fallujah. The point of view cameras do give us an interesting look at the action and some new perspective into how it's all made, which I thought was really cool, but I mean the lack of story line and constant shooting was beyond ridiculous. I'm some what surprised they'd didn't just go full on crazy and release the whole thing in 3-D."" ]"

While Cage has done every conceivable genre, he is of course best know for his action films. In Stolen, Cage once again teams with his Director from Con Air, Simon West, to give us another exciting thriller. Cage plays Will Montgomery, a career criminal who has just spent eight years in prison. Montgomery comes out wanting to start a new life, but that's put on hold when he learns that a former enemy has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. I guess no one has ever told Nicolas Cage that you're supposed to slow down with age, because he is just as good in this movie as he is in all his other films. Cage, notorious for performing his own stunts, does some amazing things in this film and is of course pure intensity. In this film he's paired with Josh Lucas who was in a film by the same title in 2009, not to be confused with that movie, Lucas plays Montgomery's partner in crime and throughout this film you can see him and Cage feed off of one another, too me, that was the best part. Lets be honest here, rarely do action films have a decent story to distinguish themselves from one another. Stolen is no different, a daughter in peril, held by a weird foul mouthed bad guy, who is being chased by a want to be hero with a less than stellar reputation, you've seen this dozens of times.  What makes Stolen stand out from those other films is the cast, it's as simple as that. The cast really keeps you interested, even when the movie gets to be predictable and even when the stunts are impossible, the cast keep bringing you back to the edge of your seat, with their great performances and extreme intensity. For that reason, even though this is a familiar and predictable film, Stolen stood out from all the other action films I've seen lately."" ]"

The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions. If you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan, check it out, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time on this one."" ]"

Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is not your typical bounty hunter, as he has a very unique and unorthodox way of getting his job done. Schultz thinks the best way to shock people is to free a slave, make him his partner, and let him ride into town and stay with him wherever he goes, which usually leads to shock, outrage, and more N words than your typical Jay-Z album. Eventually the successful duo goes in search of Django's wife, who is being held at the plantation of a truly evil man, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to get her back, the two attempt to con the southern \""gentleman\"", but will everything go as planned? This film is vintage Tarantino, filled with the unique characters you won't find anywhere else, ridiculous cameos you'd never expect, tremendous back and fourth dialogues, and of course the unexpected. as everything and anything will happen. Every actor under Tarantino's direction has a way of stepping up their game in his films, but Christoph Waltz was truly spectacular. There is a good reason he won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as somehow he manages to give an even stronger performance than he did in Inglorious Bastards. I really can't say enough about Tarantino, and out of all his films, this was the one I was the least excited about, but as it turns out, Django may actually be one of the best films he's ever done, and it is now the newest entry on our list of must see movie!"" ]"
argo;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Argo is the Academy Award Winner for Best Picture of 2012, and while it was an amazing film, the actual story was far less interesting. In 1980, the tensions between Iran and The United States began, and the U.S. embassy in Tehran was overrun. Hundreds were held hostage for over a year, but six did manage to escape and went into hiding. Knowing that their lives were even more in danger than those of the hostages, the C.I.A. developed a unique plan to get them out of Iran. They sent in one of their top agents, with credentials claiming that he was part of a Canadian film crew. Armed with fake documents, he would smuggled the six out of the country. The film was intense and featured one close call after another, but in reality, getting them out was almost too easy. They were never stopped or questioned, and slipped out under the cover of early morning, without a hitch, but what kind of a movie would that be? Once these classified files were released by the U.S. Government, Hollywood saw the chance to tell this story in an extreme manor, and did so much to the delight of audiences and much to the chagrin of the other countries involved. Ben Affleck both stars and directs this film, and while everyone raves about his performance, I thought it was typically cold and flat. Ben Affleck wasn't interesting, the character he played was. Affleck wasn't any more likeable or skillful here than he was in any other role and that's why he didn't win best actor. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the man is a fantastic Director, but a very mediocre actor. That being said, the extreme locations and huge cast, were his biggest challenge to date as a Director, and I was very impressed by the way he managed to pull it off. Argo is based on a true story, it's fast paced, and even though we all know what happened before seeing the film, it's still an edge of your seat thriller that really shouldn't be missed."" ]"

Parts of this film reek with King's influence, but I don't think he'd be all that thrilled about it.

The story follows a local resident in the town of Cold Rock, who has taken over her husband's medical practice after he passed away. That resident is played by Jessica Biel, whose performance and looks are really the only reason to watch this movie. In the town of Cold Rock, the children have been disappearing without a trace and the only thing people have seen is a tall man, dressed in black, leaving the scene. Some people say he's an urban legend, while others claim to have witnessed his abductions, and the whole town is terrified. I found it kind of funny that in a town crippled by fear, not knowing whose child could be next, the kids parents, let them ride their bikes to the store and let them play alone in the fields, it's just one of many parts of this film that just off. As I said, the beginning of this film is terrific, but then it gets weirder and weirder and builds to a conclusion that doesn't make any damn sense! I know this must of have been someone's passion and that they spent years developing it, but before you released it to the public, did you bother to watch it? Jessica Biel is sexy and a terrific actress who is way too good to be doing  b-movies like this. If you're a die-hard fan, check it out, she's great, but if you're not, I'd definitely stay away from this one."" ]"

Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get."" ]"

Former New York City Police Detective, Luke Wright (Statham), has lost his job, his family, and his respect. He's down on his luck and on his way out, when he finds a lost Asian girl in the subway. That girl is Mei, a numbers servant from China, who has been kidnapped and forced to work for an organized crime syndicate. As it turns out, Mei is holding a secret in her head that the Chinese, Russians, and even the New York City Police are willing to kill for, so when she runs away all hell breaks loose. The story here is actually pretty solid and Jason Statham is once again terrific, playing a deep character with a great back story. Had this film expanded on the story and flashed back to the past, it may have been a lot better, but as it was, Safe quickly turns into to one big chase, with lots of bullets and bodies. Newcomer Catherine Chan plays Mei and she was horrible. This girl has been kidnapped and seen horrors that most of us couldn't even imagine, yet she's always stone faced. She is emotionless and clearly using a fake accent, making her performance dry and full of mumbled lines that do nothing but confuse the audience. Jason Statham gives his usual high energy performance, with amazing moves, and terrific one-liners, but without any support, in a film that goes from one chase to another, it really is just a wasted effort."" ]"

In this installment of MIB, the notorious Boris The Animals escapes from his prison on the Moon. This is significant, because putting Boris away is what made Agent K's career and cost Boris an arm. Boris, determined to change things, goes back in the past to kill K. Once he does, everything descends into chaos and the Earth is at risk, so Agent J, goes back in time to stop him. Once in 1969, J enters into a strange new world where he sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Josh Brolin plays the younger K and is absolutely terrific, it was amazing and hysterical how he captures and mimics every single one of Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms to a tee. Will Smith is his usual self, with his quick one liners and terrific actions scenes, he hasn't missed a beat, even all these years later. For as good as the acting in this film was, the story is even better. Watching this film it's hard to believe the story is based on a comic book, because the writing really was tremendous. They took a step back and show what MIB and it's agents were like 40 years ago, at the very beginning and it was really interesting to see. Men In Black 3 is far and away the best of the trilogy and one of Will Smith's best films in years. Science Fiction is usual a narrow genre, that isn't for everyone, but this film does have something for everyone and for that it gets the label of a can't miss movie."" ]"

You just can't fit every big name into one movie and give them all significant screen time, so you had to have a sequel. The more things change, the more they stay the same, however, as this time, the story was a bit better, at least for an action movie, and the cast was a bit younger, but the basic genre was still the same. Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is once again brought together to do a job, this time there are some new younger faces, to complete what seems like what should be an easy job, what they weren't expecting was to stumble right into the middle of a madman's master-plan. As I said, the story wasn't as basic this time, things were a little more complex, but on a basic level this is still you're typical shoot em up action film, with bodies and explosions constantly coming at you. What I did like was how they change things up a bit and didn't just feature the same actors, even though many members of the team were the same. The one thing the first film was severely lacking was youth, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see Liam Hemsworth fighting with his shirt off than Sylvester Stallone. All in all, the sequel doesn't differ that much from the original, but where it does, only helps the series. The cast is younger, the story is better, and the action hits harder. If you're an action junkie, it doesn't get more exciting than the Expendables and the sequel will have you craving a trilogy."" ]"

Nicholas Cage is actual not the action star of this film, he is merely a High School English Teacher, with a seemingly perfect life. His world gets turned around though when his wife is savagely raped and beaten. As a result, Cage has two options, let the police do their thing or find someone else to take care of business. Can you guess which choice he made? Cage is of course fantastic as always. Even if the particular film doesn't suit your interests, when you see that it stars Nicholas Cage, you know you're about to be entertained. Guy Pierce is also excellent, giving a performance that was eerily similar to that of his character in Memento. Seeking Justice is definitely not an award winning film and is destine to fall under the radar of most moviegoers, but it's just as thrilling and entertaining as anything you'll see at the box office."" ]"

When I heard they were making a movie, it peeked my interest, but the previews made it look like it would be God awful, in one of the worst marketing campaigns for a film I've ever seen. After hearing some good things from friends and being that it had a good cast, I decided to give the film a shot and it far exceeded my expectations. Two of the dumbest and most immature cops on the force are sent on an undercover mission to infiltrate a local High School and find out where a new designer drug is coming from. Right from the start you could tell the film would lean more to the comedic side as opposed to the show, which was more dramatic. Going the comedic way, especially with the cast they had, was the right way to go, but much of the film was still unbelievable. Anyone who believes that either Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum could even come close to passing for High School student are completely out of their minds. Also, the speed in which these two idiots went from being the worst cops on the force to celebrated heroes was ridiculous. It would have been far more enjoyable if these guys just sorta stumbled into solving the crime, rather than all of a sudden becoming great cops. As for the cast, Jonah Hill continues to be the most underrated comedic actor in Hollywood. I have yet to see this guy do a bad movie. Channing Tatum was pretty good too, he's known more for his looks than his talent, but he fit his role extremely well. It was probably written specifically for his persona, similar to his role in Magic Mike, but he still is very good. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Dave Franco, the younger and better looking brother of James Franco, who for the very first time shows that he is more than just a kid, getting work because of his brother. He was very solid and perhaps the most believable and likeable character in this film. 21 Jump Street is nothing new, it's another cop movie that blends comedy and action, like almost every other Lethal Weapon wannabe. The story isn't better than the rest, but it is funnier than most of the other films and it has some terrific cameos."" ]"

I have to see every movie he is in because he is truly hysterical and makes everything he is in exceptional. The sitter didn't have a very strong plot, but it was a hysterical movie that worked because of Hill. Everyone around him just follows his lead and plays off his energy and it was evident here. Hill along with three kids he's babysitting go on an unbelievable and hysterical adventure in NYC. It's one of those films you don't believe and that initial comes across as stupid, but it's also a film you can't stop watching because you want to see what happens next. Hill was fantastic, the three kids were great, and for once I actually enjoyed a comedy with Sam Rockwell in it. This film isn't going to change any lives or win any awards, but it was damn good and a lot of fun, I highly recommend it."" ]"

I don't know about the book, but this film was so well written, that it seemed like it was finished in no time! Damon was great, but in my opinion, it's his son and film narrator, Colin Ford, that steals the show. Ford starred in one of my favorite movies, Dog Days of Summer, when he was younger and I've followed his career ever since. He's mostly had bit parts, but every time I see this kid, his performance just gets better and better, and he absolutely blows everyone away in this film. I'm usually unimpressed by teens in film, in fact I want to smack most of them, but Ford is definitely the exception, and really adds an important dynamic to this film.

It's hard to remember that it's his charisma that made him a star and you can really see it in Beneath The Darkness. Dennis Quaid plays Vaughn Ely, a mortician who is bat  crazy. To the town, Ely is this great guy who gives back to the community, but only one person can see him for what he really is. Travis (Tony Oller) is a local teenager who works odd jobs for Ely and has always had suspicions about the man, but never did anything about it. One night, the subject comes up while with his friends and they decide to bust into Ely's home to find out what he's really hiding. The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen. What happens is that it actually turns into a pretty entertaining and respectable film, that features a star in the making."" ]"
j-edgar;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Clint Eastwood's films are extremely historically accurate. The academy and critics love his work and especially the way he manages to get the best out of his leading roles. That being said, his films also tend to be extremely long and very dry, J. Edgar was no different. J. Edgar Hoover was the man who started the FBI. He is the man solely responsible for creating a fingerprint database, cataloging and investigating forensic evidence at crime scenes, and he was also completely paranoid and spied on just about everyone he could. It was sad to see just how lonely, narrow minded, and repressed this man was his whole life. He was so narrowly focused his entire life, that he didn't seem to ever enjoy anything besides his work. As for the film, Leonardo DiCaprio gives another stunning performance, one that rivals all his other work. People who worked with Hoover, in his later years, say that DiCaprio was so good that it was like seeing Hoover himself back in charge. When he was first starting out, people thought DiCaprio was just another pretty face, who would do films like the Beach his entire career, but they couldn't be more wrong. He has emerged as one of the best leading men in all of Hollywood and J. Edgar is a prime example of this. You can't have a DiCaprio greatest hits compilation without including this performance, it really was that good. I learned a lot from this film and the performances were truly fantastic in every sense of the word. How DiCaprio's performance didn't get nominated for an Academy Awards is beyond me and does lend some credence to the theory that the Academy is bias towards him. As for the rest of the film, it's long, very long and parts of it just don't move at all. You'll learn a lot and from a historic stand point, I think this is one of those film everyone should see, but at times it's not easy to sit through. Don't expect much in the way of action, comic relief, or deviation. It's just a lot of vintage Eastwood, DiCaprio, and criminal justice history."" ]"

There is no denying that the story is amazing. The book may be amazing, and the original Swedish version of the film might be equally amazing, but David Fincher's adaptation of it is not. From the very beginning it seems as thou he's trying to turn this story into something it's not, a sequel to Seven. The story is fantastic, however, there are so many odd names and so many mumbled lines thrown at you so quickly, that you're easily confused. At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the killer was revealed, my reaction was \""which one is that?\"" Besides being confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film.

killer-elite;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Every Jason Statham movie is better than the last, as he continues to cement his reputation as the action star of Generation X. Since it's domination of the late 80s, Action movies have really suffered due to a lack of decent story lines and an infestation of stars, who landed these roles, simply due to their size, but Statham is changing all that, as evident by his latest film, Killer Elite. Based on the novel, The Feather Men by Ranulph Fiennes, Killer Elite covers the events, following a British covert op in the early 80s. The British Navy Seals (The S.A.S.) secretly forced out oil rich land owners in the Middle East, by whatever means necessary, in order to steal their land. Five years later, on his death bed, one sheik is seeking revenge for the death of 3 of his sons. To do this, the sheik has hired an elite team of underground hit men to take out the men suspected of killing his children, not an easy task when you consider that all the targets are highly trained former military operatives. Jason Statham stars as Danny Bryce, the team leader who is forced out of retirement, to take on the hardest job of his career. As has become common place, Statham is terrific and really carries the story on his back. Killer Elite is a someone complicated plot, with a first time director, but thanks to Statham's experience, you'll think these guys have been working together for year. As his reputation has continued to grow, bigger and bigger stars want to work with Statham, and any time you can add names like Robert De Niro and Clive Owen to a film, it only enhances it and boosts it's potential audience. Aside from just the amazing action sequences and covert maneuvers, the story adds real life drama to the film, by including shady government cover ups, double agents, and even police involvement in the events, making for the rarest of rare in the Action genre, a film with a deep and compelling plot. That's what really makes this film so good, it's not just about the chases, explosions, and killing, there is a real story here, that is unpredictable and very well written. Killer Elite may not top Parker as Statham's best movie, but it's pretty close. If you enjoy a fast-paced, edge of your seat movie, with a lot of interesting characters and a deep plot, than you won't want to miss this film."" ]"
straw-dogs;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""For the 30th anniversary of Dustin Hoffman's classic film, Straw Dogs, the studio decided instead of re-releasing a special edition, that they would do a modern re-make of the film. For those unfamiliar with the story, it features a local girl, from a small Mississippi town, who has returned home with her new husband, after making it big in Hollywood. Once back in town, the new couple needs some work on the old farm that she inherited and hire an old friend of hers to do the job. The team is the most qualified in town, but right from the start you can see the tension starting to build. Straw Dogs is far from being a unique story, but what I really enjoyed about it was how methodical it was. The jealousy and tension are obvious from the start, but they build it slowly, through a serious of events, which lends credibility to both sides of the argument. Things continue to build right up until the end of the film when all hell breaks loose, thanks to an incident that really shouldn't involve either the workers or the couple. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth star and are both very good, but the star that shines the brightest is Alexander Skarsgard. I've never seen him in anything before and had no expectations about the kind of job he'd do and I was blown away. He really had to play two different roles in this film and it leads to some shocking and unexpected moments. Comparing the 2011 re-make to the original film, the stories are very similar, whoever I found in parts where the original was a little slow, the re-make turns up the intensity, and that's the way things should be. A lot of re-makes don't even compare to the original and are seldom better, but in this case it was. The producers looked back at the old film and enhanced the parts of the original that were too slow or didn't make a whole lot of sense, before modernizing the whole thing. There are some people who will never admit to liking a re-make, but I think with Straw Dogs, the producers took a good film and turned it into a great one."" ]"

The faces are different, the situation is different, but everything else is exactly the same, there's nothing original here. Jason Sudeikis and Lake Bell do a great job of making us laugh, but again it's just your basic drunken idiots out to do something special, with all the pitfalls, and weird  that happens in-between.

30-minutes-or-less;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I hate this cast of actors more than I have ever hated the entire cast of a movie in my life. Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours."" ]"

That being said, I wasn't expecting anything out of the Fright Night remake, except for a cameo by Chris Sarandon. I was however pleasantly surprised, as the young cast was better than expected. For those who don't know the story, it is a classic vampire tale. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager, whose life revolves around High School and his beautiful girlfriend. Everything is perfect until an old friend tells him that his new neighbor is a vampire. At first Charley doesn't believe him, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that something isn't right. Anton Yelchin opposes Colin Farrell, and while he might not have the name recognition, he easily outshines the veteran actor. Yelchin has a cult following among fans of teen movies, after strong performance in films like Charlie Bartlett and Middle of Nowhere. As with most teen idols, his popularity is not just about his looks, it comes from his smooth relaxed style of acting, that people can relate to. Yelchin's characters are always real and honest, the kind of guy audiences can easily relate to, and that's what makes him as good as he is. Yelchin has help in this film from an all-star cast that includes, Farrell, Toni Collete, Christopher Mintz-Plasse-Mclovin, Dave Franco, and of course the original vampire, Chris Sarandon. The combination of chemistry between new and veteran make for a truly powerful cast, that bring new life to this classic story."" ]"
the-mechanic;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""In recent years, Director Simon West has become known for turning simple action movies into big hits, thanks his unique story lines. The story doesn't actually mean as much in action films as it does in other genres, because as long as people are getting killed and things are blowing up, most action fans are satisfied. Simon West wasn't and in recent years, he has given us some great stories to go along with the amazing action. His most recent film is actually a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson classic, by the same name. The Mechanic is a code name for CIA hit-man, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham). For years, the Mechanic has gotten the job done without question, until one day his next target is revealed as his mentor. The stories are similar, but the special effects and action moves are much more intense, and we have Jason Statham to thank for that. This man has single handedly taken action films to another level. For those unfamiliar, the man speaks several different languages, is trained in dozens of forms of fighting, and he's quick with a joke, many of which are unscripted. Every film Statham does is entertaining for his tremendous moves and unpredictability. The Mechanic gives Statham the chance to show off his talents and for that, I loved it, but trying to modernize the original story without changing it all that much, makes things feel a little outdated. I found many things to be tame by today's standards and the film itself does suffer because of it. Statham is paired with Ben Foster and that's problematic for the film as well. Foster is not known as an action star, he's the complete opposite of Statham, and in this case opposites do not attract, they had no chemistry whatsoever. In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys-Myers or Alex Pettyfer would have been a much better choice, but I am just a reviewer. That being said, the Mechanic isn't a bad movie, it has all the moves and wit of a typical Statham movie, but the story is more than a little outdated and aside from Statham and Sutherland, the casting left a lot to be desired."" ]"

I am an avid baseball fan and saw this film about the inner working of the front office to be extremely interesting and just plain awesome. The Oakland Athletics are a small market team and can't afford to put a hundred and fifty million dollar team of stars on the field every years, so how can they possibly compete? It's a problem faced by almost half the teams in Major League Baseball, while teams the Yankees and Red Sox win year after year, teams like Royals haven't made the playoffs in twenty-five years! In sports, if you can't win, you can't draw fans and make a profit, so when you can't afford a winning team, you were just screwed, until Moneyball. Based on the true story of Oakland Athletics General Manager, Billy Beane, the film follows his creation of a system to judge players on more than just the basic scouting and numbers that have been used for a hundred years. Using this system, Beane and others who followed, have been able to compete with much lower payrolls, changing the face of Baseball. Brad Pitt is terrific as Beane and most definitely earned his Oscar nominations, but where did Jonah Hill's come from? I love Jonah Hill, but his character was as generic and boring as they come. In Moneyball, Hill plays Brad Pitt's sidekick, and is nothing more than a boring statistician, I've seen B-Movie performances that upstaged his in this film! If you love sports and want to know more about the behind the scenes aspect of it, Moneyball is a terrific film to use, but if you're not much of a fan and don't really care about sports, that you will just find this film boring. It's geared to a very specific type of moviegoer and if you're not into sports, you won't be into Moneyball."" ]"

My favorite revenge thriller is Payback with Mel Gibson, but Faster may be a close second. The Rock stars in a role that is absolutely perfect for him. The unnamed man was set-up for a crime his brother committed, a crime, that saw his partners turn on him and kill him. Now after nearly a decade in jail, The Rock is out and seeking revenge. With his size, intimidation, and weird eye brows, The Rock finds out who his brother was working with and goes on the hunt. Realizing this, the man who set everything up, hires a hit-man to stop him, and the chase is on. I do believe that wrestlers can be great action stars, but The Rock never really did anything for me until now. This cold, calculating man, out for revenge is by far better than any character he's ever played. If The Rock was alone in this film, it wouldn't have been as great as it was. He is paired with Billy Bob Thornton, playing a washed up, alcoholic cop, who is days away from retirement. He really doesn't need or want this case, but winds up stuck in the middle with some pretty funny moments. Thornton is one of those guys who is good in anything and always brings his unique and dry brand of humor to every role. The pairing of the two, in an intense, fast paced, story make this film an absolutely must see movie that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

The film is extremely eye-opening, showing just how bad a state most of our education systems are in. They clearly illustrate that no matter the area, teachers are failing America's youth at an alarming rate. I found the film to be very biased though, as it only points out what's wrong with the system, and fails to mention any of the positives that still exist in education. It also fails to offer solutions for the problems. Guggenheim throws lots of facts and figures at us and repeats the same themes. It gets to a point where he's just beating us over the head with the same concepts. Many people saw this as an inspirational call to action, but me, I saw it as a guy complaining. Honestly, if you can't offer up a solution than why present the problem? I'm pretty sure that almost everyone in America knows how bad education has gotten, even if they don't have the exact figures in front of them."" ]"

This brutal and horrific story is about a writer who goes to a cabin in the woods to write her next book, when she becomes the victim of a horrible crime. She survives, but decided it's not justice she wants, it's revenge. I loved this film, because it's something that could actually happen, and when it's a realistic film, no matter how graphic, I find it to be that much more terrifying. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this one, because when I say it's graphic, it is ridiculously so! There is no way they ever would have been able to trim this down to an R rating for theaters, it's that brutal.

Pettyfer was absolutely incredible, having come such a long way since his last major role as Alex Rider. Newcomer Callan McAuliffe is also very likeable as sidekick Sam. I've never seen him in anything before, but he gives the story an added bonus and much needed side story. Many critics bashed this film, saying it was an alien version of Twilight, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Am Number Four isn't focused on the love aspect, a lot of action occurs and the story actually progresses, and this film isn't dark and narrow minded, the way the Twilight films have been. I Am Number Four kept my attention and interest throughout.

When his father passes away suddenly, Reid is given this huge empire to run and with no idea how to do it, he starts to lean on the people around him, people like Kato (Jay Chou). Reid knew Kato for years, but knew nothing of what he could create and nothing of the skills he was capable of. With Kato's help, Reid decided to take on crime in the city, only one problem, he sucks at it. This film may be the most evenly scored film I've ever reviewed, because I can honestly say my like and dislikes were exactly fifty-fifty, most notably were the cast. Seth Rogan in the right setting is brilliant and in the wrong setting is just annoying as hell, with that hardly laugh and his never taking anything seriously, it is perhaps never more abundantly apparent as it is here. Cameron Diaz also adds nothing to the cast, but name recognition and a lazy one sided performance. On the other hand, Jay Chou was fantastic as Kato, he was clever, funny, exciting, and in my opinion he made this movie, it simply isn't a superhero film with him. Then there is Christoph Waltz, the man with the mesmerizing voice who forever capture our attention in Inglorious Bastards, and has been the quintessential bad guy in everything since. The bottom line is the new Green Hornet isn't without it's problems, but the story here is better than I expected it to be, there are some stand outs among the cast, and the special effects and fight scenes were hit or miss.

All Brown has left is his best friend and a tiny apartment, but that changes when a group of thugs start reeking havoc on the neighborhood and slaughter his best friend. After that, something in Brown just snaps, and he turns to skills he learned in the army a lifetime ago. This isn't a film about some over the hill action star in the CIA, there is no weird twist, or strange background associated with Harry Brown. He is just a real person, dealing with a situation that people have to face every day in lower income neighborhoods. The gangs have taken over and no one is safe, especially the elderly, and that is very apparent in this film. Harry Brown is an action thriller, but it is also one of the realist movies I have ever seen. Every thing from the gangs activity to the way Harry goes about is life is as real as it gets, and it is truly frighting. Michael Caine stars and he doesn't have the moves, temperament, or even style of your typical action hero, yet somehow he's better than all of them combined. For Caine it's never been about brawn, it's about brains, and that's what he uses against a gang that's a third of his age. Critics raved about this film, while I avoided it, because I honestly couldn't see Michael Caine cleaning up his neighborhood and taking out thugs at his age. I was wrong, because Harry Brown is one of the best performances of his career. This film is just so realistic and clever, I never would have expected it to be the amazing experience that it was. This film really got to me and it includes one of the best performances I've ever seen. Harry Brown is a true gem of independent cinema, it is free of any Hollywood bull **** and it is the reason people still go to the movies. Please take my advice and don't miss this one."" ]"
death-at-a-funeral;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Death At A Funeral is a remake of a 2007 British comedy by the same name, and is usually not the type of film I go for. For starters, I hate Chris Rock, and I really couldn't see a film about a funeral being all that funny. The previews were a riot and I love Martin Lawrence, so I decide to give it a try and was once again was taught that you can't judge a book by it's cover. This film turned out to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. It's a solemn day for Aaron and Brian, as they prepare to lay their father to rest. They expect it to be a small, simple ceremony, but they are soon reminded of why their family only gets together at weddings and funerals. A series of unbelievable and hysterical events keep disrupting the service, which include, but are not limited to, a gay midget, a guest tripping on acid, and a crotchety old man that really has to poop. I'm not surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, but I was surprised by the reasons why I liked it. You'd think an R rated film staring Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence would be raunchy as hell and way over the top, and it was, but not because of either of them. Rock and Lawrence were actually fairly toned down in this film and it was the large cast of supporting characters who really make the film. Danny Glover is amazing as Uncle Russell, an old timer who hates everyone and isn't afraid to run his mouth. James Marsden is equally as good, as the hated white boy friend, who takes what he thinks is Valium to calm down before the service. Death At A Funeral is absolutely hysterical and full of non-stop ridiculousness, if this film doesn't make you laugh, there is most definitely something wrong with you."" ]"
stolen;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""When you watch a lot of independent and direct-to-video films, you see a lot of garbage, but occasionally you find a gem that makes it all worthwhile, Stolen, is one of those gems. This story was so intriguing and well written that I was absolutely blown away. The film is about a detective whose son went missing, without a trace, eight years ago. The trail is cold and he's beginning to accept that he will never find him, when a local construction crew finds a boy in a box. The body has been there for at least fifty years, but the case awakens something in the detective who has to learn the truth. From there, quite ingeniously, the film is divided into three different stories, the story of the boy in the box, the detectives investigation, and the story of his own child. It was seriously like watching three different movies at once, and they were all great! The cast was pretty phenomenal too, as this was a very hard thing to pull off, but they did it seemingly with ease. Josh Lucas just blew my mind, giving an unrivaled performance as the father of the other missing boy. I've seen him in things before, but nothing was as memorable as this. Stolen is a film that consists of three stories in once, that will pull on your emotions and have you on the edge of your seat.

Of course there is that old saying about too many cooks in the kitchen, but that wasn't the problem here, as individually, the performances were pretty good. What I didn't like about the film, was a lazy story that hasn't only been done before, but seemed to just run around in circles. The Foster family is going through your typical dry spell as a married couple with kids, and the news of a recent friends divorce has them worried about their own relationship, so they decide to start having a regular date night again. Not wanting to wait at a fancy restaurant without a reservation, they claim to be someone else, who are very late arriving to their reserved table. The Foster's think they're just stealing a reservation, instead they are stepping into the lives of two people who are wanted by many different people for many different things, leading to the wildest night of their lives. This story had some great potential, but once again, if these writers would stop worrying about PG-13 vs. R, in regards to who will go see their films, and just let the story take off in whatever direction it's going, the film could have been so much better. Instead, the writers hold back, because they don't want a raunchy comedy, they want a date movie, and the result is a mediocre comedy that should have been so much better than it was. Date Night is good for a chuckle here and there, but otherwise, the story goes in circles, it's predictable, and it wastes the talent of a terrific cast."" ]"

Does Hollywood have some secret underground bet about who will have the worst accent? That being said, Gibson, (minus the accent), was terrific. Say what you will about him as a person, but when it comes to a dark, action thriller, there is still no one better than Mel Gibson. His character was very reminiscent of Porter in Payback, intense, strong, and smart as a whip. As I said before, this is a good story, made even better by Gibson, but it's a familiar story that's been done to death! Edge of Darkness is very entertaining and has some nice twists, but ultimately it's not much different from a dozen other films with a similar tagline."" ]"

Until now he's been asked to do simple things. His role quickly changes once and international terror cell sets up shop in his backyard. Rhys-Meyers is quickly paired with a veteran C.I.A. hit-man. The kind of guy you call when you want things done quickly and under the radar, but years of killing has taken it's toll. The mysterious man has become cold and reckless to a fault. The story here is painfully predictable, in a film that is about half as long as it should have been. Yes, the film is basically non-stop action, but it moves in such a way that the story is rushed to the point of confusion. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was terrific in an opposites attract kind of way. John Travolta on the other hand was much too old and out of shape to be believable as this crazy, over the top hit-man. The chemistry between the two and the amazing non-stop action make this movie a pretty entertaining one, but the predictability and rushed story take too much away to make it the kind of film that keeps audiences buzzing after it's over."" ]"
daybreakers;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I hate vampire movies! From Dracula to Twilight I find the whole genre absurd and have never enjoyed a film that has featured vampires, until now. I chose Daybreakers, because it is a new idea in an otherwise stale genre. It's about a modern day utopian society where the bad guys have actually won! Modern society has adapted, from industry and technology to entertainment, to accommodate a society run by vampires. Humans are nearly extinct and the vampires are looking for a blood substitute to sustain their population. On the other side, the small groups of remaining humans think they may have a cure, but need some willing vampires to help them. Even though this film features vampires, it's more of a science fiction film. about two groups trying to deal with the problems of a futuristic society, and it was really well done. Ethan Hawke stars as a vampire, who refuses to drink human blood. He feels empathy for the humans and doesn't like what his race has become. Hawke was one of these young actors who had nothing but looks. When he first started he was really nothing more than eye candy for bad movies. Since then, he's really worked at becoming a better actor and today, he thrives in Sci-Fi movies like this. He's paired with some veterans of the genre, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, both of whom add that aged wisdom needed to support this young cast. This film is a terrific example of how innovative and entertaining science fiction can be, but it's so much more. There are action scenes, romance, and even some gore thrown into the mix, and the result is one of the best Sci-Fi film I've seen all year. The violence and blood may turn some people off to the film, but for me, this really became a can't miss gem."" ]"
whiteout;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When I first saw the previews for Whiteout, I didn't think it would be anything special. It wasn't until Netflix recommended it for me and I read the description, that I thought there might be something there. While the previews made it look like some arctic nightmare, the truth is that it was a pretty great film. The story is centered around a U.S. Marshall, stationed at the base in Antarctica. For more than 3 years, she didn't really have much to do, but that all changed when two base members are found murdered. It then becomes Carrie Stetko's job to solve the first murders in the continents history. Despite a lack of other people and places to go, the writers of this film did an excellent job at keeping this movie intriguing. I didn't think in a million years that a film like this would work, but actually it works out really well, and unlike a similar story, Fargo, the producers of Whiteout hold nothing back. Kate Beckinsale stars and really does a fantastic job. I've always like her abilities, not to mention the way she looks, but this film is the first time her performance really stood out to me as something special, maybe she should consider playing a cop more often. As someone who's seen thousands of films, it always amazes me how the films I expect the least from, always deliver the biggest surprises.

Hader is one of the funniest and most underrated comedians in Hollywood and I can honestly say that he is the only reason to watch this movie, because the rest of the cast is just dull and uninspired. Eisenberg gives another flat and emotionless performance, while co-star Kristen Stewart plays along as if she were still one of the undead.

Observe and Report is one of those films that just doesn't cut it. In the film, Seth Rogan plays Ronnie Barnhardt, who is the equivalent of Paul Blart on a bad trip. He's a mall cop, who is obsessed with his job and with the hot girl who works the make-up counter at the local department store. Literally the only funny part of this movie is the flasher, that Ronnie is trying to catch. It's simplistic humor, but a man running around a mall, flashing his penis at people, and making dirty comments is funny! The rest of this film is not, as it's one big racist, childish, romp, through a world of sex, drugs, and the abuse of power. Rogan is terrific, but his character was a rambling, confused, uneducated guy, that just wears on every last nerve. Observe and Report is a film that has been done, many times and in many different ways. The producers hoped that an all-star cast would help the film, but sadly it doesn't. The film plays as though it was written by a teenager, and all that's missing is the fart jokes. I'm a big Seth Rogan fan, but I was sadly disappointed by this film."" ]"

The stories all involve these peoples interactions with the mob, but they're all for different reasons and all have different outcomes. Andy Garcia is the boss, of course, always the perfect choice for a gangster or ruthless leader, and you get from him what's expected. What isn't expected is the tremendous performance of Brendan Fraser. I am not a fan and have never really considered him anything but a mediocre comedic actor, but after seeing The Air I Breathe, my opinion of him was definitely swayed. While watching the pieces, I knew they would somehow come together, but the way it was done was completely unpredictable and really something to watch. The film had a huge cast, with a ton of cameos, and just as many twists and turns. What I was expecting was far different from what I saw and I was more than happy with the way the film was done.

Walk Hard is a mocumentary about an Elvis Presley type persona, whose music spanned an evolved over a 50 year career. As styles changed, so did Dewey Cox, his outfits, personality, and his music, it was all very clever. I especially liked when he ran into the Beatles at a monastery in India. Walk Hard has some very funny moments, but this film would be nothing without John C. Reilly. It seems like he's in everything these days and most of the roles are quite forgettable, but Dewey Cox is easily his crowning achievement. Reilly is an actor I don't care for, in a style of film I don't care for, yet I was still very amused by the whole thing. The one negative I can give the film, is that is was exceptionally long for this type of film and it spent far too much time on the early stages of his life. The end of the film felt rushed to avoid it becoming a three hour movie, which to me suggests that maybe it should have been split in two. The inherit problem with comedies is that the longer they are, the more tiresome they become. While I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot, by the end I really couldn't wait for it to end. Farcical comedies are usually way out there and Walk Hard has some of that, but by and large it was an interesting take on fifty years of American pop culture.

Criticism range from the film not being edgy enough, to the fact that the film didn't take place in Springfield and didn't utilize the side characters much, but again, the film wasn't meant for the die hard Simpsons fan. While the show has been on for more than a quarter century, prior to the films release, ratings for the show were in the toilet, and it was only being kept alive by syndication and merchandising money. The point of the film was to be childish and geared towards a younger audience. While fans of the show were expecting the film to be extreme like the South Park movie, what they got amounted to little more than a children's movie. The fans were upset, but the studios gamble paid off, as the ratings went up and have continued to be much better. For those who didn't see it, the film focuses on Homer, who made the mistake of polluting the town, to a point where the EPA put a big dome over Springfield to separate it from the rest of the country. As angry town folks form a mob, intent on getting Homer, the family escapes and goes on the run. The film is far from being the best the Simpsons has to offer, but it served it's purpose in attracting younger viewers and raising the ratings.

Many credit Boyle with the current zombie craze we enjoy eleven years later. What made that film so enjoyable was that at the time it was a story we hadn't seen in a long time and it was shot in a way that made it look like a much older film than it was. Five years later the studio wanted a sequel and Boyle wanted no part of it, knowing that it would never live up to the original and indeed it does not. 28 Weeks Later is a continuation of the story, which claims that all the infected had starved to death and that England is free of infection once again. People start moving back in to areas of the country that have been fixed up for them and which are protected by the U.S. Government. We are then introduced to a family which has been reunited. The film starts out with a tremendous action scene that was the only part of the film I enjoyed and the only part that is reminiscent of the first film. The terrific opening is followed by a long, sappy, family reunion and then by a sick person being found. From that point, literally within ten minutes hundreds of people are infected and the army is shooting everything in sight. How could zombies have starved in the first place, but more importantly how can so many people change, just like that, within ten minutes? It didn't make any sense at all, to make things worse, all dialogue and storyline ends at that point and the movie turns into one big gory chase scene without any substance whatsoever. As for the cast of this film, they did nothing to help the story. In the first film, Cillian Murphy was amazing and carried us through the low points, but here it's a cast of newcomers and unsuccessful character actors, who quickly bring the story to a halt. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but not only doesn't it compare to the first film, but it doesn't even live up to the broad genre it is exposing us to. The cast was sloppy, the direction was confusing, and worst of all it just doesn't make any  sense! 28 Days Later was groundbreaking, but it's sequel is nothing more than an over-hyped movie that never should have been made."" ]"

Ever since, there have been a whole slew of films that have tried to be the next Home Alone. None have come close to being as good, but perhaps the best attempt came from Unaccompanied Minors. The Davenport kids are flying to seeing their father for the holidays when they are stuck in Cleveland by a massive snow storm. When they get there, they discover they are just two of dozens of kids who are stuck at the same airport, trapped in a conference room under the watchful eye of the airports ruthless administrator, (Lewis Black) who's not all that fond of children. Together with some of the more unique personalities, the Davenports stage an escape and wreck havoc on the airport, determined to have fun during the holidays, even if it is in a snowed in airport. Yes, this is a kids movie with all the cheesy jokes and kid stuff that comes along with it, but what makes it unique is all the different personalities. The six kids are from all different parts of the country and are all from different family structures and different socioeconomic backgrounds, meaning they all had very different lives and very different ideas on what the definition of fun is. The culmination of the different personalities and how they all come together is what makes this film unique and quite frankly pretty special. The young cast is pretty talented as well, featuring Brett Kelly from Bad Santa as well as Tyler Williams from Everybody Hates Chris. The young cast also gets help from veteran comedians Lewis Black, Wilmer Valderrama, and Rob Corddry. The combination of young comedians and veteran comedians adds another dynamic similar to the one set up by the characters in the film. As well as the mixing of characters personalities, you're also getting a wide variety of comedic styles in the film. The bottom line, Unaccompanied Minors may be a kids Christmas movie, but there is a whole lot to like about it, from the writing, to the in depth character development, the mixing of different comedic styles, and even the unique settings. It's not quite Home Alone, but as close as anyone's come since 1990."" ]"
black-snake-moan;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Samuel L. Jackson is legendary and he has the unique ability to turn even a strange movie like this, into something that is worth watching. Black Snake Moan is a really ridiculous story, full of odd symbolism that just really doesn't make any sense. Jackson plays Lazarus, a loner who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. He's a deeply religious man, whose wife just left him for his brother. Lazarus responded to this by locking himself away and putting all he has into his farm. One morning he finds a badly beaten girl, with a reputation, laying in the road and decides to help her, but he soon comes to believe that this girl is possessed and that God sent her too him for help. Not knowing what to do, Lazarus takes this sex crazed, drug addict and chains her to the wall of his house. Throughout this film, there are all kinds of symbols that don't make any sense. There are scenes featuring an old blues singer talking nonsense, scenes of the town that we almost never see, and perhaps strangest of all, there are moles added to Jackson's face, something you don't see except it cases of a biography. As for the performances, they were terrific, This is the best performance I've ever seen Christina Ricci give and she really gave Jackson a run for his money. Jackson, was also great, giving what you expect to see from him, albeit with less swearing than usual. The performances were really the only thing this film did have going for it as the events that take place just don't make any sense. The film jumps around, leaving things unfinished, and personalities seem to change as often as the wind blows. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I really hate when great performances are wasted on a film that is so poorly written, that it's almost unwatchable. Black Snake Moan is sloppy, jumps around without finishing things, and at times just doesn't make sense. It was an interesting idea with a terrific cast, but the people behind it were clearly in way over their head and just didn't really seem to know where they were going or even what they were doing."" ]"

We see a young Hannibal in Europe, during WWII, and we learn how he grew into the monster he became. What made this different from the other Lecter films, was that Hannibal is seen as a good guy for much of the film, just out seeking revenge. French film star Gaspard Ulliel is fantastic in his first American film and was the perfect choice to play a young lecter. As a fan of the film franchise, I found this movie fascinating, but as an outsider I can see how some people would find it a bit long and slow."" ]"

hot-fuzz;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The comedic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are changing the way people view British comedy. For decades, the Brits have been far behind us, featuring the dry, the peculiar, the tedious, and worst of all, Monty Python. Ten years ago, I wouldn't see a British comedy if you paid me, but now, all I need is to see this duo involved and I'm there! Hot Fuzz was the duos follow up to the wildly successful Shaun of The Dead, and while it doesn't compare to that film, it is still a really funny movie. The film features Simon Pegg as London's toughest cop, who is unwillingly transferred to a small town in the country. Paired with an idiot, he's about to die of boredom, and starts looking into the towns history of mysterious accidents, only to discover a pattern. Once Pegg has the scent, he's on the trail of a long running town secret, one that is ridiculous yet hilarious. Unlike Shaun of The Dead, the story here isn't as cut and dry. It requires some background and does take quite a while to get going. Unlike any of their other films, previously or since, the duo decided to pack all the fun into the last half hour of the film. Hot Fuzz certainly has it's moments, but it's the last half hour that makes it a classic. Simon Pegg plays the serious one for a change, leaving much of the laughs up to Nick Frost who certainly doesn't disappoint. Personally, I prefer Pegg over Frost and would have liked to see his character loosen up a little bit, but it doesn't really take anything away from the story. The first half hour of this film, you're going to think I'm crazy, but by the last half hour, you'll be thanking me for recommending you see this film. It is a must for fans of buddy comedies and it just might force you to watch Shaun of The Dead again."" ]"

I decide to give the series another shot, not because of Bond, but rather Daniel Craig. I have been a fan of Craig's for some time, having seen several of the films from overseas. I knew then that he would be a huge action star and now he's 007. As for my first Bond movie, it was pretty good. Craig was fantastic and avoided much of the cliché Bond moments that most of us have come to loath. The film was entertaining, but also pretty predictable and much longer than it needed to be. I was also very unimpressed by the bad guys. I thought Bond villains were supposed to be classic, but these guys were rather forgettable. I'm not in love with the Bond character, but this film did open my eyes a little bit and I probably will check out Quantum of Solace in the near future."" ]"

They fully understand, that even thou it isn't a comedy, they are in a completely ridiculous film, not meant to be taken seriously by anyone. Samuel L. Jackson is fearless, hysterical, and terrific as FBI Agent Neville Flynn. The supporting cast, of mostly newcomers, is also great, playing off the example set by Jackson and Margulies. Lets also not forget that while many of the attack scenarios were computerized, there were still a few dozen de-fanged venomous snakes with them at all times! I don't know how you can possibly concentrate with cobras and rattlesnakes at your feet, even if they are non-venomous and used to humans.

While I enjoyed what I was seeing, the story just twisted and turned in ways I couldn't really follow. I know I loved watching it, but afterwards I was still like what the hell? The ending was the most confusing part, not real sure what happened there, maybe one day I'll get it. This film had the star power, one of Hollywood's best directors, and a unique story, but it's going to be hard for a lot of people to follow.

Along the way they meet their fair share of weird characters and it's pretty much the same as 1000 other coming of age teen comedies, except for the gay part... This movie has some really funny parts, especially the interaction with the lesbians, THAT was classic! Unfortunately, they continue focusing on the one subject, and the jokes just stop being funny after about twenty minutes or so.

the-zodiac;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""As a culture we are obsessed with serial killers. While some writers choose to glorify these monsters, others simply want to show the truth behind their crimes and the investigation that followed. Unfortunately, in a lot of cases, the real story is no where near as interesting as Hollywood makes it out to be, that's where the based on a true story comes in. The case of the infamous Zodiac Killer was a fascinating case, of a man who not only killed at random, but who also taunted the police, by publishing cryptic ciphers in the newspaper, claiming if they cracked the ciphers, they'd know who he was. The man behind the crimes was certainly an interesting case, but the long investigation into finding out who the person might have been, was not. As a film, The Zodiac is said to be a fairly accurate portrayal of the crimes, the investigation, the paranoia than gripped the city, and the political pressure everyone faced as a result. The film makers didn't want to take liberties with the story, glorify the crimes, or present unproven theories from any one of the a number of books written about the Zodiac Killer. That being said, what happened was interesting, but also fairly slow moving and more than somewhat dry. For those people who are unfamiliar with the story of the Zodiac, they may enjoy learning about this case, but for those of us who know it, watching this film was like seeing a very long episode of the First 48. It's interest, the acting is suitable, and it passes the time, but if you're looking for a real entertaining, Hollywood version of the Zodiac story, you'll be much happier with the film simply titled, Zodiac, from 2007, starring Robert Downey Jr. That film is based on one of the more populist theories of the crime, and features more edge of your seat action than it's predecessor."" ]"
twelve-and-holding;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""With his utterly shocking debut film, L.I.E., Director Michael Cuesta, quickly proved that he wasn't afraid to push the envelope in order to shock his audience. That is why I was hesitant to see his other coming-of-age film, 12 & Holding. Thankfully, this film was more on the level and told a different kind of story, one that larger audiences can relate to. Rudy Carges (Conor Donovan) is an introverted 12 year old boy, who because of a facial deformity, does not socialize outside of his small circle of friends. A circle which includes a strong leader and protector, his twin brother, Jacob. One summer night, a bullies prank goes horribly wrong and Jacob is killed, leaving the group to find their own direction. As someone who recently lost someone close to me, this film really hit home, it was inspirational and a truly a wake up call. The film does an excellent job of showing everyone's grief from the family, right down to the furthest acquaintance, the type of lose and emptiness that people of all ages feel when a tragedy like this occurs, but then the film takes a turn. The three remaining members of the group realize, at their young age, that life is short and you never know what's going to happen, so they use the tragedy as the inspiration to turn their lives in another direction. Conor Donovan stars and it is miraculous that at his age he could play two completely different characters with such ease. The twins are so different, even though they are played by the same person. This is the kind of performance, actors three times his age can't pull off successfully, but Donovan does and it makes the whole film. Because of this role, the young Donovan actually got a role in the Departed, but hasn't been in much since then, which is truly a shame. 12 & Holding, actually uses actors that are the same age as their characters, and what these kids had to play through, and how they did so was truly phenomenal. IFC films have a reputation for being great, hard hitting stories, but this one really struck a nerve and the performances blew me away. If that's not the definition of a must see movie, than I don't know what is."" ]"

Unlike Williams previous hits, it's not raunchy and it won't tick off any particular group in America, but it's still a cute comedy, and Williams is as funny as ever. Williams proves in this film, that a good comedian is always funny, and that you don't necessarily need to be raunchy or obscene to be funny. RV was for the most part a family film, with way too many jokes about doody, but it was still good for killing a few hours with a few good laughs."" ]"

Instead of voting for the common good of the people, they are paid in voters and campaign contributions, to vote the way big business wishes them to vote. The result is laws that benefit the few and hurt the many. Thank You For Smoking takes an in depth look at one of these lobbyists, who works for big tobacco. In a satirical way, the film shows how this man is able to achieve his companies goals through bending the facts, bribery, and out right lying in a way that is completely legal under our system of government. Aaron Eckhart is terrific, which will come as little surprise to many, however the film was anything but. Like most films, Thank You For Smoking has it's moments, but overall the film is one short scene that just repeats it's self over and over again. The situations are different and the players are different, but the arguments and agendas are always the same. After watching two hours of the same thing over and over again, I was more than done with this film. No matter how charismatic the actor may be, the fact is that what lobbyists do isn't terribly interesting. It's one meeting and argument after another and the film just completely runs around in circles. The film was critically acclaimed for Eckhart's performance, but nothing else. Some critics think that one outstanding performance makes a film worth seeing, but I don't. Aaron Eckhart is an outstanding actor, who has been great in many other films that are worth seeing. Thank You For Smoking is nothing more than an insult to the American people, that runs forty minutes too long, and just goes around in circles, it's not something I'd recommend wasting your time on."" ]"

The story itself is very inspirational and the acting is top notch. This isn't just a good film, it's one that you know took a lot out of everyone involved.

freedomland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Exploring racism and police misconduct in a mixed neighborhood, Freedomland had ambitious goals and tried to tell it's story without taking a position. As the film moves forward, it becomes very clear which way the films writers are leaning, and it defeats the films intended purpose. Julianna Moore plays a woman who claims she was carjacked in the black part of town. Samuel L. Jackson, one of the detectives assigned to the area, goes to investigate, and when he interviews the victim, she drops a bombshell, telling Jackson that her 5 year old son was in the car. We all know that Samuel L. Jackson is a legend and he performed like one in this film, but the problem was Julianne Moore. I get that she's playing a mother who is missing her kid, but she was so whiny and out of it the whole film, that every scene she was in was just painful to watch. Add to that the fact that she's trying to use some southern redneck accent, and she was barely understandable. A white woman claiming her child was kidnapped by a black man is the premise of the film and leads to the police putting down the hammer on the black part of town. It was a story that could have gone in so many terrific directions, but instead it falls flat on it's face, with nonsensical sub-plots, shotty performances, and of course a writer who did anything but tell his story objectively. The investigative part of the film was pretty interesting and Samuel L.

What I always admired about this film, was that Adam Sandler finally gave his underlings the chance to shine. With experience comes knowledge, and the possibility of being more than just one liners in the middle of one of his films, that was the hope anyway. The story follows an adult game tester named Alex (Allen Covert), who is forced to move in with his Grandmother and become part of her Golden Girls lifestyle. Along with her and her roommates, there are several funny moments, but nothing to write home about. The rest of this film just isn't that funny! Most films about losers, connect to the audience and make you pull for them in the end, but when it comes to Alex, I just really didn't care all that much. In typical Sandler form, there is a girl and some weird conspiracy involved, but the whole thing wasn't even good enough for the man who starred in Jack & Jill, so to call it one of the funniest movies of all time, it isn't even close.

The film shows one fictional groups encounter with this man and shows just how twisted some people can be. If this were a fictional slasher film, I'd call it nothing special.

The book was written by one of a families ten children, about their mother and how she raised their entire family by winning sweepstakes, which were extremely popular in the 50's and 60's. The Ryan family was your typical suburban family, Kelly (Woody Harrelson) worked in a mill and spends most of his paycheck on alcohol. That leaves Evelyn (Julianna Moore) to raise 10 kids on almost no money. Evelyn was in advertising before she became a housewife and had a knack for writing slogans and jingles. As a result of her circumstances, she entered every contest she could find and surprisingly won a large number of them, despite the odds. She won the house they live in, as well as most of the appliances, and even a few cars they sold. The story was truly fantastic and a wonderful tribute to a woman, who in some ways could be considered a modern day working mother. Evelyn was played by Julianna Moore, who gives the performance of her life. Once again, an independent film is overlooked by the Academy, but had this been a major release, there is no doubt in my mind that Moore would have won the Oscar, she is really that good. A good portion of the story is focused on this extraordinary woman, but we do meet her husband and we see her kids at various ages and walks of live. It seems like a movie that could quickly fizzle out, but life is never slow or boring in the Kelly household. On a side note, the author of the book, Evelyn's oldest daughter really made a name for herself with this book and made a cameo at the end of the film. Unfortunately, her career was short lived, as she passed away shortly after the films release. The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is the kind of tribute we'd all love to give our parents, but most of our parents didn't do the extraordinary things Evelyn Ryan did.

Here he's paired with Billy Bob Thornton, who under the right circumstances, can be hilarious. While he was pretty funny, he has almost no chemistry with Cusack and that hurt the film. These guys were partners, but on completely opposite pages and it just doesn't work.

north-country;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Sexual harassment wasn't a concern in the work place until 1984, when the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit was brought against the owners of a mine in Minnesota. This is the story told in the award winning film, North Country, which graphically shows the horrors these women had to face at work on a daily basis. Charlize Theron was amazing, portraying Josey Aimes, the woman who finally stood up and said enough is enough. Theron is the kind of actress who is usually overlooked because of the roles she takes. I had a difficult time judging what kind of an actress she really was until seeing her in the role of a lifetime. Portraying Aimes as realistically as possible, Theron really made the audience feel the struggle of a single mother, having to take a difficult job, just to put food on the table. We see how the harassment at work effected every aspect of her life and it actually changed my view on sexual harassment. As harsh as it sounds, I always viewed sexual harassment as a law created by people who were too serious and couldn't take a joke, but the story of Josey Aimes is no joke. No person, male or female, of any color, race, or sexuality, should ever have to face even half of what Aimes had to go through. This example is how you know that North Country is one amazing film, because any movie that can change a persons opinion on a subject, is worth it's weight in gold. Theron isn't the only gem in this film, as France McDormand also received an Oscar nomination for her role as a co-worker suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. I also thought that Woody Harrelson deserved recognition for his portrayal of the attorney who represented the women. In 1984, there had never been a case like this, and for him to go out on a limb for something like this was truly special, and its reflected in his performance. From top to bottom this film is very solid, the cast is terrific, and the story is a historically accurate portrayal of sadly, a much overlooked moment in American judicial history. North Country is the kind of film that I truly believe every child should see before entering the work force for the first time. It is that powerful and also earns a spot on our list of must see movies!"" ]"

Neil is a male prostitute, cold and heartless on the outside, but lonely and miserable on the inside. JGL does a great job of portraying both to the audience. Be warned thou, this is one graphic film, not for the faint of heart. There are a lot of raw scenes featuring Neil, in fact, I don't think I've ever seen someone get undressed as many times in one movie as JGL does in this one. As for the film, it starts out strong, then in the middle, it seems like your typical, weird, indie flick. Don't turn it off just yet, because it gets better and better, building up to one of the strongest endings I've seen in a long time. This isn't something that hasn't been done before, but a combination of a great cast, top notch acting, and a brutally graphic depiction of events, makes it unique and something that you're going to want to see."" ]"
mindhunters;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The cast of Mind Hunters is as weird and diverse as any movie can get, but what turned me on to this film was the fact that it was Directed by Renny Harlin. Harlin is a legend in the world of action films, responsible for such films as Die Hard 2, 12 Rounds, & The Long Kiss Goodnight. He usually doesn't waste his time on direct-to-video films, and prefers to feature his own people, but the story here was so good, that he must of made an exception. Mind Hunters follows seven FBI agents who are training to be profilers, under the watch of the toughest trainer there ever was, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer). For their final test, the group goes to a small island the navy uses for training, and must work together in order to catch a serial killer that doesn't exist or do they? Once they begin their investigation, the group quickly come to realize that the scene is booby trapped and they are cut off from the outside world, trapped on an island with a killer. While having a unique location and a terrific director, what I really enjoyed about this film was how it was more than just some slasher film. This group isn't just a bunch of frat girls running from a guy in a hockey mask, they are trained, intelligent, FBI agents, trying to figure out which one of them is responsible for setting the rest up. This film features all the fighting, gun battles, and chases that you get in a typical action thriller, but there is also a methodical obsession among the group to find the one that betrayed them, and for that this film is unique. Kathryn Morris stars and has more than enough experience playing a detective, after sever years on Cold Case. Likewise LL Cool J has played a cop on numerous occasions, most recently on NCIS: Los Angles. Going into the film, I wasn't all that crazy about this cast, but once I got into it, I realized that they were brought together, because all of these guys have plays cops, FBI agents, or some kind of law enforcer in the past. That mix of unique personalities and experience help this film, because what the cast lacks in talent, they make up for with experience. Mind Hunters isn't something you've never seen before, but it brings together several different common themes in a new way and it will keep you on the edge of your seat."" ]"

The film chronicles the height of their success in the late 70's and their struggles in creating and rising to the top of a whole new industry. The story is terrific, written by one of the actual Z-Boys, but the way it was filmed was problematic. The beginning of the film is very choppy and confusing, honestly it's difficult to know who is who and what's going on until about the half way point of the film. The Z-Boys are the basis and stars of the film, but it's Heath Ledger who steals the show. He really had a gift for picking up on every mannerism and movement a person makes. People who know his character, Skip, say it's scary how much like him Ledger was. He was a truly gifted actor who would have been a legend.

Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was.

This film is your typical goof ball, family, holiday film, except with a much better cast then these things typically have. The chemistry between Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis was terrific, and in my opinion make the whole thing work. Besides the big named cast, producers also included a ton of cameos from the likes of Cheech Marin, Dan Akyrod, and Felicity Huffman, just to name a few. Seeing a big name you really like, who is not listed in the credits, show up even for a small role, it always adds to the enjoyment of the film. This is not the kind of movie that is going to win any awards. It might not even be the kind of holiday film that is remembered ten years from now, but it's certainly entertaining, with some heartfelt moments, and it's good for a few cheap laughs.

To my surprise, most of them said they stopped after the Prisoner of Azkaban. Personally, I think Azkaban was the best one so far, so why not continue? The unanimous answer was that they didn't really want to see the kids grow up. In the Goblet of Fire, they aren't quite there yet, as in their 4th year at Hogwarts, the kids are 14. The story this time isn't centered around some mysterious artifact or person, but rather a world wide competition of student wizards. The Goblet of Fire decides who the best of the best are, allowing only one student from each school to participate. This film was special, but also lacked some of the intrigue that got us addicted to Harry Potter in the first place. Finally, a Harry Potter film focuses entirely on Harry and we get to see some of the great things that he is supposedly capable of. In fact, Ron and Hairmony's roles amount to little more than bit parts, where as in the other three films, they were all on equal ground. The fact that this was a competition takes something major away from the film. In the Goblet of Fire we aren't introduced to any new artifacts, games, or spells, there really isn't anything here that will amaze you. While it's a small thing, it's an expected thing, that does take something away from the film. What makes up for it is a terrific ending, that has to be seen in order to continue on with the series. For years, I thought Harry Potter was just overrated, pop culture, bull  but once I sat down to actually watch it, I came to realize that this series is as magically as the world it portrays. Every one of the first four films has been fantastic and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the wizards of Hogwarts."" ]"

This was a necessity for the film, Zero Day, which gives an in depth look at the psyche of two school shooters. The story isn't unexpected or anything you haven't seen before, but what makes this film unique is how the producers went about casting this film. The entire cast is made up of ordinary kids, with no previous acting experience, to that end, the entire immediate family of the shooters are also used in the film. Given that these kids weren't actors at the time, a lot of scenes also remain unscripted. The kids were told to just talk about things that make being a teenager tough, expressing dark, innermost feelings of rage and hatred of society. It was then that the writers wrote dialogue that corresponded with what these kids were saying. The result of this is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen. It was like actually being able to watch the video diaries of the Columbine shooters, expressing their feelings, and explaining their actions, prior to that tragic day. Both boys featured in the film are terrific and the way the Director just let the story flow, based on what these two kids had to say, was absolutely ingenious. I think this film was an amazing insight into the minds of troubled teenagers and I think it's a must see for anyone in the field of education."" ]"

Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban."" ]"
philadelphia;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Philadelphia will always hold a place in cinematic history, as it is the first major film to really address the discrimination against Aids and Homosexuality. It also was the beginning of Tom Hanks amazing run of Academy nominated film, that may never be duplicated. The message of the film comes across loud and clear, but not quite in the way that the film's producers intended. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) was a top attorney with one of Philadelphia's top law firms, when all of a sudden he's fired. Beckett believes he was set up and fired because he has Aids, but can he prove it in court? As the film goes, it is easy to see the discrimination and stereotypes that Beckett has to face on a daily basis, and weather or not you accept homosexuality, it's powerful ending will make you feel for the plight of any homosexual who suffers from this horrible disease. The majority of this film takes place in the courtroom and centers around Beckett's case against his former employer, and as someone who has studied the law, I can tell you that the case destroyed the merits of this film. There are things that both sides do, that would never be allowed in a court of law, and in my opinion neither side really makes it's case. As far as the legal aspect of this trial goes, it is very subjective and would never lead to the verdict that was handed down. As for the stars of this film, they are the ones that make it as powerful as it was. Hanks gives a performance that was absolutely worthy of the best actor award, as following him and his story is really what gave the film it's reputation. Quite ingeniously, Hanks is paired with Denzel Washington, who plays his attorney. Washington's character is meant to represent how much of the audience felt at that time, as even while representing Beckett, he speaks out about Aids and Homosexuality. The more he works to represent Beckett, the more you can see his attitude change, the same way the audiences attitudes change as the film moves alone. I loved Philadelphia for it's performances and it's message, but as far as the story goes, the trial is the majority of the film, and the trial is completely unbelievable. In my opinion the trial takes away much of the film credibility. The issue and the case should have been more clear cut and the legality of it all should have been easier for the audience to understand. That being said, if you choose to watch this film, you will be hard pressed to find better performances by a better cast, but the story will leave you feeling somewhat incomplete."" ]"
the-manchurian-candidate;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The remake of The Manchurian Candidate is one of the few Denzel Washington films I've never seen. To be honest, the story just didn't interest me that much, but it started streaming this month, so I gave it a shot. As expected, it's a someone complex story, that at times was difficult to understand, however an all-star cast manages to pull it together at the end. The story begins in Iraq during the Gulf War, when a U.S. Army platoon goes missing for three days. Even they were unaware of what happened to them, until one of the men starts having nightmares, and bodies start turning up. Denzel Washington plays the commanding officer, who takes it upon himself to investigate the strange deaths of his men, almost a decade later. As always, Washington is at the top of his game, giving off that infectious intensity, that keeps you on the edge of your seat through every step of the investigation. Washington is paired with Liev Schreiber who is one guy that has always just rubbed me the wrong way. It's not that he's a bad actor, there is just something about him and the characters he plays that is inherently unlikeable. He wasn't bad in this film, but being a similarly intense actor, meant that the chemistry with Washington was almost non-existent. The story is complicated and in the beginning of the film, it's going to be somewhat hard to watch. As the film proceeds and the elements become more clear, the film gets easier to watch, and the ending really pulls everything together. The Manchurian Candidate is one of those films that you think is going to be a bust, some people may even turn it off, but those who stick with it will see that it just gets better and better until a surprise ending brings it all together. If I were the writer of this film, I would have made the beginning of the film more intense and less confusing. The truth is the most important parts of a film are the beginning and the end, and without a strong opening, a lot of people will be turned off to the film and have the wrong attitude throughout. If you manage to stick with it, The Manchurian Candidate is great, but it does take a while to get there."" ]"

Little Manhattan was however the film that got him started. It's a simple story about a ten year old boy and his first love. Basically, I saw it as Sex In The City from the adolescent males point of view. (It even features Cynthia Nixon and Willie Garson.) The film was cute, but it should have been so much better. The kids were acting way way WAY too mature for ten year olds. I was a ten year old boy once and nothing like THAT ever crossed my mind. The parts are written for much older kids, nevertheless, Hutcherson and Charlie Ray both do a fantastic job with their respective roles.

As soon as he sees him, Tom starts flirting and convinces Dan to go home with him, where Tom ties him to a chair and tells him they've met before. After obtaining a blood sample, Tom lets Dan know that when that test comes back, if Dan is positive also, he's going to die. The film is based on an award winning play and I venture to say as a play, this would have been terrific. On the big screen however, the same raw emotion isn't as evident and the story doesn't have much in the way of variety. The 24th Day is very narrowly focused, and after it's initial abduction and reveal, it becomes quite boring, as both the men and the audience prepare for the ending. In transferring this story to film, I feel as though something more should have been added to story. Maybe some flashbacks or an unintended visitor, just something to break up the monotony. Both Scott Speedman and James Marsden are very good in their respect roles and I really enjoyed both the beginning and end of this film, unfortunately the middle is somewhat boring and takes away from an otherwise original and outstanding story."" ]"

What the film has in talent, it lacks in substance, as it's really just a whole lot of Leland talking in code. The writers go out of their way to show Leland as this deep, emotionless kid, that's been trapped inside his own mind his entire life. As the film goes on, the more Leland opens up. The writers paint the portrait of this kid and show you ever aspect of his life, in the hopes that you will figure out his true motivation before it comes out. The result is a slow moving film that causes the audience to gradually lose interest as time goes on. There is no doubt the Ryan Gosling was spectacular and deserves every good thing said about his performance, but the story seems to move slowly and in circles.

the-punisher;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The problem with this movie was that it couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, and this ultimately led to its downfall at the box office. The beginning of the film is really intense and it seems like it's going to be one of those, 'it could happen in real life' comic book adaptations. After the first half hour though, that's gone and replaced with the typical unrealistic bull  This film also couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be PG-13 or R. Ultimately it got the R rating and has the violence that goes with it, but clearly the producers were hoping for the PG-13, and have some really childish parts to it. I hate when that happens, make up your mind! If you're going to be violent and crazy, then go all out, and if not, tone it down and get the PG-13.

hellboy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Much like the Punisher, Hellboy was created for the older comic book fans. The character was designed to be an anti-hero, less refined than Batman or Superman, someone who would hate being labeled a superhero. While the comics weren't as popular as others, the film gave life to the franchise and created a cult following. The story is meant to introduce us to the character of Hellboy, a cat loving, cigar smoking, red guy, with a bad attitude, who secretly works for the government protecting The United States from paranormal threats. Everyone knows by now that I hate superheroes, so the idea of the anti-hero really appealed to me. I could have easily become one of the cult followers and fallen for Hellboy, the way all the comic-con kids did, if it wasn't for the uncertain direction of the film. Guillermo Del Toro struggled back and fourth with whether or not this film should be geared for kids or adults, and went the PG-13 route. It worked in terms of getting a larger audience, but it also took away from the original intent of the character. Throughout the film we keep hearing about how tough and dangerous Hellboy is, but he's really wasn't that much of a bad ass. If Hellboy is so unlike any hero, why is he working for government instead of breaking the law, and why is it that he doesn't utter a single curse word? The character was far too toned down for my liking, but the flip-side to that was how nasty and creepy some of the bad guys were. Broom is one of the best comic villains I've ever seen and given his Nazi background, he most certainly was not intended for kids. Overall, I enjoyed parts of the film, I loved Ron Perlman, and as with any film by Guillermo Del Toro, the special effects were amazing. However, the lack of direction makes the film somewhat unfulfilling and anti-climatic. Hopefully that will all change when I get up to Hellboy II."" ]"

The end of the film went from extremely predictable to ridiculously strange and confusing. While I'm sure the ending made perfect sense to the Wachowski's, it made no sense to me, an avid science fiction fan and movie critic. This being a review, means I can't go into specifics, but the ending was absolutely horrible and puts the whole series in a different light. The most disheartening part of this whole thing is that until that point, the Matrix has been done to near perfection. The story was solid, the action was out of this world, the special effects were amazing, the casting was flawless, and just when the trilogy should have reached it's apex, it all comes crashing down. Once again the cast is terrific and the story is great, which is why I don't understand how they could give us an ending like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and it will certainly hold it's place in cinematic history, but as a fan I was horribly disappointed by an ending that came out of nowhere and left the audience scratching it's head."" ]"

The story includes many of the action sequences and interesting characters associated with Dick's stories, but Paycheck does lack the futuristic Science Fiction that has become Dick's signature, which is the main reason this story isn't as well known as his other works. The story takes place in modern day, where a man is offered an irresistible deal. Jennings (Ben Affleck) is told that if he works on a secret project for the next 3 years, he will receive 100 million dollars. The only catch being that after the 3 years are up, Jennings memory will be erased and he will have no idea what he worked on. As expected, Jennings accepts the deal and returns to his life 3 years later, but nothing is that simple. Soon everyone from the FBI to bounty hunters show up trying to get to him, and the only clues he has come from an envelope he sent himself, containing 19 random items that seem to have little or no value. Ben Affleck stars and by this point we all know how I feel about him. Affleck is a terrific Director, who seems to have little interest in acting anymore. Paycheck however is a 2003 film, a time before Affleck had proven himself and he shows that rare charisma that is only present in his real early work. His performance is outstanding and aided further by his chemistry with co-star Uma Thurman. Thurman is another performer who I find isn't very good unless she's in very specific type of role, and fortunately for Affleck, this is one of those roles. Paycheck is missing the big signature associated with Dick's work and will be somewhat disappointing to his fans. I did miss the futuristic element, but I was intrigued by the mystery Jennings was trying to solve and the 19 items. Combined with the action sequences, (that are always top notch) Paycheck isn't what I expected, but was still very well done and definitely worth watching."" ]"

The reason is simple, for this one, they actually got a real cast that include two of my favorite actors and the gorgeous Jessica Biel. This story isn't any different than the other ones. A bunch of friends on a road trip take a wrong turn and find themselves being hunted by a mad man. The film is full of gore, bad jokes, and beautiful people, it's really nothing out of the ordinary, except for the cast. Great actors can make anything entertaining, even the most bland and repetitive film gets new life when you introduce a cast like this. Three extremely talented and under appreciated actors, give support to the less experienced cast members, and while much of the film was focused on Biel and Leatherface, you could still see the influence of the veteran stars on the rest of this cast. If you don't like Horror, this film won't change your mind. If you're looking for originality, you won't find it here. If you're looking for some good performances from a very talented cast, that is something The remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre will give you."" ]"

All the main characters had two different sides to them, inside and outside the courtroom and it was great to see who they are on the surface as well as who they really are on the inside. Like all Grisham films it comes down to a verdict, which was the result of information we didn't previously know. Runaway Jury follows the genre John Grisham has created to the letter.

manic;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Lyle Jensen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has a few issues with anger management. Most of the time, he's in complete control, but one day, during a baseball game, he loses it and almost kills someone. Lyle's not quite eighteen yet, so he's sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he learns that compared to others, his problems are nothing. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the single most underrated and under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. I've seen a lot of his films, some are great and some are awful, but the fact remains that he always gives a strong performance and makes even the worst movie that much better. Manic was a rare inside look at a youth psychiatric facility, but there wasn't much of a story behind it. Of course we meet Lyle and the other patients, finding out why they're there, but there really isn't a point to it. The quality of the film further decreases with the way it was filmed, as every scene features constant movement from numerous angles. Similar to these camcorder films, I honestly found it pretty distracting, not to mention nauseating. The best part of Manic though is clearly the performances. This was released in 2001, before any of the stars were household names, however after seeing the film, it's easy to see why they all became popular. Don Cheadle is another actor that doesn't get the recognition he deserves, playing the Doctor in Manic, he is the glue that brings everyone together. Even with JGL's performance, this film is a mess of nonsense without Don Cheadle. Manic is somewhat disturbing and filmed in a way that makes it hard to watch, but the performances are just about as good as it gets and make this film worth seeing."" ]"

The location of the movie didn't make a whole lot of sense, and that wasn't the only thing. Why would a detective from Miami and his ex-wife be investigating a crime an hour away in some small town? Miami PD isn't the FBI. The movie has a lot of plot holes and everything that happens is fairly obvious. It's entertaining, but it's not going to blow anyone away."" ]"

It most defiantly doesn't live up to the original, but surprisingly it wasn't terrible. Eric Christian Olson does a terrific job as Lloyd, the story of how they met, as well as references to the original, and the cameos make this film worth seeing.

keeping-up-with-the-steins;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Being Jewish, I have a bias towards liking a film like this. The usage of Yiddish, along with the many exaggerations of the Jewish family are something most people won't understand, unless they grew up around it. Parts of this film I found to be hysterical, while my non-Jewish friend, sitting next to me, didn't get it at all. As for the film, it's a lie before the credits even stop rolling. Keeping Up With The Steins, really has very little to due with the Stein family, as they are part of the background story at best. The film is actually about a broken family, forced together on the eve of a child's Bar Mitzvah. Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) is turning 13, which in the Jewish religion means that he is about to become a man. His parents are well off and are making huge plans for the event, but Ben wants no part of it. In an attempt to take the attention off himself, he sends an invitation to his estranged Grandfather that he's never met, a Grandfather, who shows up to the families wealthy neighborhood in an old RV, with a woman half his age. This is where the heart of the story comes from, as father and son are forced together after fifteen years. Jeremy Piven stars as the son and believe it or not he's a big time Hollywood agent, living in a life of luxury. This toned down version of Ari is forced to see his father, played by the legendary Garry Marshall. For the past 15 years, he's been living as a hippie,  teaching on an Indian reservation. As soon as they see each other the two are at odds and it really is very funny. The star of the film is Spy Kids, Daryl Sabara, who I have never liked. He's just always so shy and painfully awkward, I really just don't understand his appeal. While he is a major part of the story, the parts of the film that feature him without Marshall or Piven are just painful. Keeping Up With The Steins isn't raunchy and much of the humor is intertwined in the Jewish religion. If you're not Jewish, you'll probably have the same reaction my friend did. Personally I loved it, but I can understand how this film won't appeal to everybody."" ]"

No doubt this film is great, but what most people don't know is that there is actually a sequel, with the same narrator, made 11 years later.

the-matrix-reloaded;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""Contrary to everything we know about trilogies, the sequel to the Matrix is considered to be the best of the three films. The reason is simple, as this is where we get into the heart of the story. The first film was equivalent to the pilot episode of a TV show, where we are introduced to the characters, terms, and locations. In the second installment of the Matrix we are introduced to the real struggle and get a look inside the legendary underground city of Zion. The humans there have learned of a plan by the machines to tunnel through into the city and want to come up with a way to stop them. While Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to stopping the whole thing, most of the other are skeptical. In Reloaded, Agent Smith doesn't play as large a role as in the first film, for that matter, neither does the Matrix itself, which makes it almost like a stand alone rather than a sequel. Reloaded isn't just a great Sci-Fi story as it features one of the best action sequences and chase scenes I have ever seen, following the groups interaction with the Merovingian. While the film was great and does top the original, the Directors once again tried to use never before seen special effects. While it worked well in the first film, it doesn't help the second. Many of the fight scenes with the agents become so computerized, that at points they actually seem to be animated, and those scenes hurt the film. Other than that minor inconvenience, I can't find anything wrong with this film. It is Science Fiction at it's best, featuring an perfectly cast group of actors, some edge of your seat intensity, and of course a very unique story. All that makes the Matrix Reloaded one of our must see movies!"" ]"

It is also another post apocalyptic film that plays into people's fear of the end of the world. Most of these movies suck, but Boyle knew this and made sure his movie didn't. 28 Days Later follows the life of a survivor (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in an empty hospital after an accident. He has no idea what's going on, but soon learns the horrible truth. Boyle decide to film the movie as if he were following this stranger from a distance, with an outdated camcorder. It gives the movie a grainy, dark, 70's style and fits right into the story. Cillian Murphy is great in his first leading role and you can see why he's now a name in Hollywood. Overall, it's pretty bloody and predictable, but defiantly not your typical end of the world film. The acting is top notch and the way it was filmed and directed make it something special."" ]"
54;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Okay, most people wouldn't admit it, but I will. I only watched this movie for the graphic sex and nudity. Based on the trailer, I was expecting a giant orgy, filled with drugs and dance music, but to my surprise, 54 actually turned out to be a docudrama about Club 54, as seen through the eyes of a young waiter/bar tender/dancer. The film features the shady practices of the owner, the drug trade inside, the celebrity guests, and of course the eccentric regulars, in what turns out to be one hell of an entertaining film (...and the sex and nudity don't hurt either). Ryan Phillippe stars in a role that today I could never see him taking, but back in his younger days, he really excelled in. The way he was able to demonstrate how the exposure to a place like that can change a person, was truly remarkable. He literally went from nothing to a face that was known all over the city, simply because he was a waiter at 54. It went to his head and changed the whole dynamic of his life and relationship with his family. For as good as he was though, Mike Myers was the real star of the film, portraying famed owner Steve Rubell. Rubell's life was just one big party and he never slowed down or cared about what he was doing or saying publicly, and we all know how that turned out in the long run. Myers is one of those actors who is out of this world when he's cast in the right role, and terrible when he's not, but much as the case with Austin Powers, this role fit him like a glove. On the surface, 54 is a wild, raunchy film that is going to offend a lot of people, I don't suggest watching it with your grandparents. It does however, tell a very relevant and historically accurate story of the drug and youth culture of the mid-late 1970s in the big cities. 54 is sexy, entertaining, and informative, a mix that you don't often see on the big screen."" ]"

Shia LaBeouf is great as a troubled kid sent away to a work camp, where they uncover a hidden secret. Surprisingly thou, it's newcomer Khleo Thomas who steals the show. His story and background are so sad and he plays it so well, that you just want to hug him every time he opens his mouth. Veterans John Voigt and Sigourney Weaver bring experience to the film and really give the kids a strong example to follow now and in the future.

how-to-eat-fried-worms;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""When I watch films like this, I am looking for three things. I hope to find some young talent, before anyone else knows who they are, a unique story, and a funny scene or two. Unfortunately, the story here is quite disgusting and there weren't any stand out performances, but there was a really funny scene, where the nerdy kid gets caught playing dance dance revolution. The story begins when a new kid named Billy (Luke Benward) moves to town. The other kids immediately try to intimidate him, by replacing his lunch with a bag of worms. To their surprise, in defiance, Billy eats the worms and gains their respect. One thing leads to another and eventually a very disgusting competition is born. The film is based on a very popular children's book and that's really who this film was intended for. Occasionally, you get some surprises out of a film like this, but as I said earlier, there really wasn't any stand out talent here. I didn't find any young actors/actresses that I could start following from the beginning of their career, but the kids weren't bad either. They seemed to have a lot of fun with the strange story and ultimately I think kids will probably really enjoy it.

jumanji;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Despite the fact that I am a huge Robin Williams fan, I had never seen Jumanji, it just never appealed to me, but even since Williams' untimely passing, I've been trying to view his entire filmography. I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend."" ]"

The combination of Al Pacino's infectious personality and Sidney Lumet's methodical and innovative story telling. At the time Serpico was made, Al Pacino was the brightest star in Hollywood and for good reason, he just has a way of getting people behind whatever character and project he's associated with. As for Lumet, he is known as an innovative director for simply trying things that everyone had available to them.

He thinks he's on top of the world, with a wife, a girlfriend, and a group of clients, who don't know what scum he is, but someone has noticed the real Stu Shepard and has trained a rifle on him. Shepard has to do as he is told or risk becoming yet another victim, of a man who has been targeting New York City's businessmen. Colin Farrell is a very versatile actor, it's always been his biggest strength, but generally I find his performances to be kind of flat. Farrell has never been someone who I would consider a top tier Hollywood actor, but looking back on this early performance, I have to tell you, I was impressed. The setting of the film was so limited, that the only way it works is if you have a strong and believable cast, which Phone Booth certainly has. Every character has a unique back story and everyone is interconnected, in a film that is full of intrigue and edge of your seat action.

Chelios goes out seeking revenge, but must keep his adrenaline pumping, in order to slow the poison down. It's a strange story, but as usual, Statham is terrific, playing his most extreme character. Chelios is a crazy man who goes to extremes, however that's all this film has to offer. Non-stop action can sometimes be fun, but when it's the same thing repeating over and over again for 90 minutes, even the biggest action fan gets tired of it. Statham is paired with Amy Smart who starred in my favorite movie of all-time, The Butterfly Effect, and surprisingly she was terrible! She plays Chelios's girlfriend, a girl who is as dumb as dirt and who follows this crazy man blindly through the city on his hunt for revenge. Crank has some humor and a terrific leading man, but unfortunately, there isn't much of story. Besides Statham's well known one-liners and his ridiculous moves, there is really nothing to see here. Crank is one of those films that starts out strong and then just never goes anywhere. Having seen a lot of Statham's movies lately, I was hoping his best known film would be his most exciting, but it wasn't.

He's given a role that suites him perfectly and he mumbles and relies on the rest of the cast to carry him. In the future, emotions and things that evoke emotions are outlawed, and Bale is one of the men responsible for enforcing these laws, but he soon turns to the other side, when he accidentally feels an emotion for the first time. Bale is a cold guy to begin with. He never shows much emotion even when his role calls for it, so aside from Keanu Reeves, he was the best choice for this role. The story was a little out there and the effects were over the top, but it's Bale himself who puts the icing on the turd cake. He's completely dependent on his fellow cast members and the ridiculous special effects his character is given.

They may have been searching for different things and in different situations, but to me the movies are far too similar. I honestly felt like The Da Vinci Code, was a slower, less interesting version of National Treasure. Tom Hanks was amazing as always, but in general the movie was slower and far less interesting to me. It's unfair to compare it to something else, but based on its own merits, it was very entertaining, well acted, and well written, but it was also very slow at times, wordy, and somewhat confusing. Overall it's very good, if you plan on seeing it, don't watch National Treasure first!"" ]"
running-with-scissors;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Running With Scissors is the true story of Augusten Burroughs childhood, one that he himself admits is so far out there, that no one will believe it. He's right, the story is way out there, and it's very hard to believe that all this went on for years unnoticed. Augusten's mom is mentally ill and eventually signs his custody over to her psychologist. He and his wife live in a mess of a house, with 3 other kids, none of whom are their own, and all of whom are mentally ill. The ironic part to the whole thing is that the doctor who is supposed to help everyone seems to be more ill than anyone else. Joseph Cross is great as Augusten, and Brian Cox is hilarious as Dr. Finch. It seems as thou Cox is in everything, and he always gets those hysterical random lines. Annette Bening however steals the show. The movie was weird, the story is weird, and outside of the funny and psychotic parts, I was kind of bored. This movie wasn't great, Bening however was amazing. It's too bad this movie was so far out there and so far under the radar, because I truly believe she was Oscar worthy in this role. The story is unique, the movie isn't very good, but the acting is top notch. Running With Scissors is worth seeing if for nothing else but the outstanding performances of its cast."" ]"
school-for-scoundrels;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Following his Old School Road Trip, and long before his epic Hangover, Todd Phillips went back in time to remake the classic School For Scoundrels, with disappointing results. The story follows an insecure loser in love, who takes a class on how to become more appealing to women. His teacher is a total player, who teaches the class to the best of his abilities, but in the end, he has the same goal as the others, and ultimately falls for the same girl as the loser. When seeing a Todd Phillips comedy, that is unrated, and features Billy Bob Thornton, you should expect to see a raunchy good time, but that's not what happens here. To Phillips, keeping as close to the original story was more important than modernizing it for today's audiences, and the result was a film that fails to live up to expectations. This film needed a major injection of raunch, the kind Thornton became known for in films like Bad Santa. Instead you get what amounts to an average, mediocre, comedy. In this film, Thornton is paired with Jon Heder, Napoleon Dynamite himself, but as with that film, his monotone lovable loser act, gets old very quickly. This film has all the makings of a wild ride and a terrific comedy, but instead it falls flat on it's face, as just another ordinary, run of the mill, romantic comedy."" ]"
road-to-perdition;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When Road To Perdition hit theaters, it was critically acclaimed and was eventually nominated for six Academy Awards. While it was a great film, it was very dark and fails to deliver the emotional impact that it intended to have on it's audience. In the 1930s, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man living in the suburban mid-west. By all accounts, he is a normal man, who is hiding one very dark secret, he is a hit-man for an organized crime syndicate. His secret is safe and life continues on as usual until one day, his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses his father execute someone. Sullivan assures his bosses that everything is fine and his son won't say anything, but when has the mob ever taken that chance? Sullivan and his family are targeted for elimination and only he and his son manage to escape to Chicago, where he plans his revenge. As with most films based on a novel, the story here is top notch and very well written. Tom Hanks is the premier actor of our time, a man who will be remembered for centuries, but was he really the right choice to play Michael Sullivan? Hanks has many amazing skills as an actor, but playing such a cold, sedentary character, Hanks is unable to use his many tools and gives a performance that is very dry. The audience simply doesn't relate to Sullivan the way they relate to his son, and that brings the emotional impact of the film way below what it was intended to be. Tyler Hoechlin is fairly well known now, but when he got this role, it was his first, and he beat out over 10,000 other kids to get it. I don't know who any of those other kids were, but Hoechlin couldn't have had much competition, because he was out of this world good. It's a shame that the Academy rarely recognizes kids and that Paul Newman got the Best Supporting Actor nod over Hoechlin, because this kid is really the only one who comes off in a way that the writers originally intended. Road To Perdition was a tremendous story and was full of award winning actors, but the star power was more important to the producers, then finding actors who fit the characters as they were written. Aside from that and a painfully predictable ending, that you have to see coming, this was a pretty good film. I loved the setting and how dark it was, as well as the originality of a film that takes places nearly 60 years ago. I just find it ironic that in a cast full of Academy Award winning actors, it's a kid who steals the show."" ]"
igby-goes-down;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I really love these weird independent comedies, that you have to be somewhat intelligent to understand. They are so much different from all the repetitive crap that we are subjected to over and over again. This is the story of a kid from a privileged family who just doesn't fit in. He sees the hypocrisy of it all and decides to run away to NYC, where he meets some unique characters that you'd only find in New York. The middle Culkin brother, Kieran, stars and was incredible. Simply put, sometimes the story is good, but the movie is made by its star, and Culkin gives one of the best performances I've seen in a film like this. Igby Goes Down has a ton of stars, it's a clever story, and you really connect to the characters. I really enjoyed this film, but be warned, it's not for everybody. I honestly believe when it comes to this type of film, you need a personality that relates to some aspect of the film. Without that connection, you might not get as much out of this film as others did."" ]"

minority-report;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Most people don't recognize the name Phillip K. Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed."" ]"

She wants to know if it's real and if it is wants to pay the family for her husband's mistakes. The investigation takes Welles down a deep dark road that few travel and even less know about. The story is just so dark and creepy that some of you might actually be freaked out by it!

the-thirteenth-floor;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""The Thirteenth Floor was Columbia Pictures answer to the Matrix and is based on the award winning 1964 Sci-Fi novel, Simulacron 3 by Daniel Galouye. I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law  Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality. The Thirteenth Floor is a fresh story with an amazing cast that will make you think, movies like this don't come along as often as they should!"" ]"

Billy Zane is a guy with a clouded past, who decides to use an experimental drug to restore his memory. Only to vividly remember a murder he witnessed, but was it his memory or someone else's? I don't like Zane one bit, but in this movie, he's pure genius. What was really striking about this film, (especially since it's a low budget b-movie), was the imagery. Everything is so vibrate and methodically done. First time director, Bennett Davlin, really has you sitting on the edge of your seat. It really feels like you're alongside Zane, seeing what he sees. As for the ending, I never saw it coming. I've seen a lot of films, and you've got to have a pretty good story to surprise me! It's a film you've never heard of and won't see in theaters, but it's defiantly one that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

insomnia;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Insomnia was the second major motion picture by acclaimed writer/director, Christopher Nolan. Even in the most early stages of his career, it's easy to see his genius, that's why so many big stars wanted to work with him right away. Insomnia is the least well known of all his films and does lack some of the things that have become Nolan's trademark, but it's still a terrific film. The story follows two L.A. Detectives sent to a remote part of Alaska, where the sun doesn't set for six months and then doesn't rise for six months. They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path. Despite being one of the best Hollywood has to offer, I haven't really been much of a Pacino fan. To me, it seemed as though he had lost something with age, his performance in Insomnia proved me wrong. Terrific is not the word for what Al Pacino was and he's not the only genius Nolan surrounded himself with. This film is incredibly well written and being the perfectionist that he is, Nolan got only the best people to star in it. It's not the kind of Nolan film, we've been spoiled with over the past 10 years, but Insomnia is a great story, with an unbelievable cast and in my opinion is a must see."" ]"

It was the story of trust and redemption that centers not around Georgia and her rules, but rather around her granddaughter played by Lindsey Lohan. I don't like Lohan, her previous roles, or even how she is as a person, but in this movie, she's terrific. I think it's because she was actually playing herself.

Elisha Cuthbert is the difference between Captivity and the dozens of lame horror movies produced every year. Don't get me wrong, Captivity is full of gore and has a ridiculously stupid storyline, but it's not that bad, and Cuthbert is the reason. The veteran actress, best known as Kim Bauer and The Girl Next Door, is very methodical with every move she makes and that really manages to keep your attention. The maze of traps, moving walls, and pitfalls were also really cool, but outside of that and Cuthbert, Captivity is your typical gore fest, with zero character development, and a chilling story that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I liked it for the little things, but overall, there's nothing special here, just another lame horror movie, that happened to land the right star."" ]"

impostor;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""Impostor is one of the lesser known stories by the master of Science Fiction, Philip K. Dick. It is so unknown, that one of his biggest fans, didn't even realize that this film was based on a story by Dick, until I saw it in the credits. As usual, the story is out of this world, as it takes place in the distance future, a future where the Earth is at war with an alien species. This species has the ability to clone humans in such a realistic way, that it is nearly impossible to detect them. Special military investigator, Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio), is tasked with figuring out who has been replaced. On the eve of a big announcement by the President, Hathaway intercepts a transmission claiming that her top military adviser, Dr. Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise), has been replaced. When Hathaway confronts Olham, he claims to have no knowledge of this, and unlike previous replicates, he has memories. As Hathaway prepares to eliminate Olham, he escapes to the surface, where he teams up with the exiled citizens who live there. Together they try to prove Olham's innocence, while avoiding being captured by Hathaway. Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Hathaway, and much like his role in Law & Order: Criminal Intent his intensity and determination are infectious. He's paired with Gary Sinise, an actor I'm always disappointed to see in a leading role, and whom always manages to surprise me with a great performance. He isn't what I'd call an action star, and may not have been ideal for the role of Olham, but he was very believable. Impostor was only one of Dick's short stories, but it is every bit as good as his better known works, which of course include; Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report. If you want to see a unique story that blends Science Fiction, Drama, and Action, look no further than Impostor."" ]"

When people don't like the movie, right away they go after the writer. They don't realize that a lot of times things are drastically changed to make them more visually appealing. In a horror flick, that's usually means  and/or gore, which are out of place in a King story. 1408 has none of that, it's just a good old fashion horror story about a room that possesses it's residence.

My expectations weren't very high and the story, based in Science Fiction, had the potentially of being too hard for audiences to understand. The writers decided to go another way with it and put this unique, experimental technology in the accidental hands of a teenager, and then marketed the whole package to young adults. It sounded a bit sketchy to me too and that's why it took me almost ten years to see it, but what I learned from this film, you can never judge a DVD by it's cover. Clockstoppers combines Einstein's Theory of Relativity with teenage rebellion in an action packed film that will really leave you on the edge of your seat. The story starts when a former student of Prof. George Gibbs sends him a prototype, of a watch, that speeds up your molecules to the point where it looks like everything else is standing still. Prof. Gibbs soon leaves to go on vacation when his son finds the watch and wears it out, thinking it's a normal watch. Once he learns the truth, other Clockstoppers show up to try and kill him, and that's when the film really gets going. The acting and special effects aren't really what draws you into Clockstoppers, it's the story, which throws you in every single direction and leaves you craving more. This was a film that was at the bottom of my list, that I watched because it was short and it was streaming.

That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series.

Aside from having a mostly unknown cast, the film was written, directed, produced, and starred Richard Dutcher, who created a production company called Mormon Cinema, which only makes Mormon related films. I have found that when a film comes from such a strong religious backing, that it usual has a preachy agenda, and tends to focus more on religion than anything else, but to my surprise, Brigham City does not. The film does takes place in a Mormon community, all the characters are Moron, and there is a religious angel to the film, that includes several scenes in the church, which were slow, but thankfully not overwhelming. The story centers around this small religious community in Utah, that is suddenly rocked by a series of murders. Dutcher, plays the sheriff, a highly respect, deeply religious man, grieving for the loss of his family. His town has always been a paradise and has never faced anything like this before, so the sheriff needs to come up with some pretty interesting ways to catch the killer. Dutcher was excellent in his role, after all he wrote it, and who else is better equipped to play such a role? What I really liked was how different the story was, this wasn't just your typical manhunt for a killer on the loose, there were many different facets to this film that made it unique. What gave Brigham City it's fourth star was the amazing twist at the end that no one will see coming. I've seen a lot of films like this and 9 times out of 10, I have the killer pegged before they are revealed, but this film completely blindsided me, which proves to be just another example of how clever it is. Yes, there is some religion and yes much of the cast is unknown, but I found this film to be fascinating.

the-score;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""In what was widely considered to be a passing of the torch, three generations of Hollywood superstars, joined forces for a thriller known as The Score. I found this to be a very strange film, as it features both moments of high intensity and moments that are painfully slow. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, the best safe cracker you could find, but as he's getting older and seeking more stability in his life. Considering retirement, Wells is asked to be part of one last big score, that will have him, and his fence, set for life. Wells reluctantly agrees, before finding out there is a catch, he'll be working with his possible replacement, an arrogant and cocky young man, who could wind up getting them all caught. As far as acting goes, you may never see a better trio of leading men, De Niro, Marlon Brando, and especially Edward Norton were absolutely terrific in their roles. The film however doesn't really take off until the crime actually begins. For over an hour they are in the planning stage, painstakingly going over every detail, and it really is as bad as it sounds, in fact, I almost turned it off, until the wheels were set in motion. From that point, the film really is terrific, with an ending that will leave your jaw on the floor! I was very happy with the last forty minutes of the film, and all three actors were fantastic, but so much of this film moves at a snails pact that I really couldn't give it a higher rating. This is a two hour film, that could have easily been shortened to an hour and a half, without losing any of it's integrity. All the detailed plans and unnecessary back and fourth make the first hour of this film painful, but if you can stick with it, the second hour is certainly worth it."" ]"
bill-teds-excellent-adventure;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Since the very beginnings of film, \""buddy\"" comedies have always been very popular. From Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello to Cheech & Chong and Harold & Kumar, audiences love to see what kind of trouble these guys can get into. After 25 years and with talks of a second sequel on the way, I finally decided to see what Bill & Ted were all about. I was always scared off by the PG rating, I mean George Carlin in a PG rated film, come on! The first part of the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, as the two failing history dudes, fly around the world looking for historical figures. Things turn from ordinary to extraordinary when the group finally returns to 1989 and decide to go the mall of all places. This is where the film really finds itself and becomes more than just your typical buddy story. The interactions with people and the reactions on both sides are absolutely priceless and is what changed my opinion of this film. Keanu Reeves stars in one of his earliest roles, and manages to show that at some point in his life, he did have a personality and could tell a joke. His partner Alex Winter didn't really do much before or since, and while he wasn't great, he did have chemistry with Reeves, which always helps a movie progress. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure wasn't so excellent, but it was different and manages to hold your attention. I still think this film would have been much better if it were R rated and a lot more edgy, but for what it was, it wasn't bad at all."" ]"
reservoir-dogs;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from legendary Director, Quinton Tarantino, and that's why it's taken me such a long time to see it. Most Directors, even the great ones, aren't always successful right out of the gate. In fact, it's a very rare thing to accomplish, but I should have known that if anyone could do it, Tarantino could. In his signature style, Tarantino heavily uses flashbacks to piece together an amazing story of a heist gone bad. The score of a lifetime is at Joe Cabot's fingertips, so he puts together a crew of six of the best criminals his city has to offer. To make sure nothing goes wrong, everyone remains anonymous and is given a nicknames. Right from the start of the film, we know that something has gone terribly wrong, but what happened? That we'll eventually find out in pieces, through flashbacks, in a style that is pure Tarantino. Even in his first film, you can see the style, classic lines, and intriguing that made Tarantino the household name that he is. Aside from flashbacks, the other thing Tarantino is known for, is putting together unlikely casts, that turn out to be perfect for the roles they are in. Harvey Kaitel as Mr. White, may very well be the best of the lot. Kaitel is at the top of his game, and while older and unlikely to be the leader of the group, he turns out to be much more, including the star of this film. Reservoir Dogs is nearly twenty-five years old and it is still as exciting and relevant today as it was then. I never thought anything would ever come close to topping Pulp Fiction as my favorite Tarantino film, but Reservoir Dogs certainly makes a compelling argument for the top spot on that list."" ]"
american-gangster;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I'm not particularly fond of Russell Crowe, but when he came together with Ridley Scott, some terrific movies got made. Throw Denzel Washington into the mix and you have the makings of an epic drama. American Gangster was beloved by critics and the academy alike, but it also received negative reviews from the people the story was based on, who claimed it was ninety percent fiction. The film takes almost 3 hours to tell us the story of Frank Lucas, a man who was mentored by the great Bumpy Johnson, and ran Harlem, along with much of the heroin on the east coast from 1969 to 1977. In passed years, even prior to this film, Frank Lucas has been immortalized as some kind of hero. Many believe that he kept the people of Harlem out of poverty and ultimately did the right thing, once his conscience caught up with him. The film American Gangster seems to agree with this take on the story and portray Lucas as a man larger than life, who you want to like, despite his criminal activity. The truth is that Lucas was no hero, as for a decade he ran a crew as large as any organized crime family, and he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who overdosed on his junk. When Lucas turned states evidence, leading to the arrest of 150 people, most of whom were corrupt officials in New York City, it had nothing to do with his conscience, he just wanted to stay out of jail. That's not how it portrayed and was the only thing that really kept this film from getting a five star rating. American Gangster is shot much in the same style as Heat, with a large cast and fasting moving scenes. Denzel Washington is always good, but when he's playing someone from his own community he really steps it up to a whole other level. Washington absolutely should have received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Lucas. Regardless of how true the story may have been, Washington was just amazing. Denzel is paired with Russell Crowe, who portrays the man who is chasing him, a very deep and interesting man that seemed to fit Crowe's personality to a tee. American Gangster is a long, fast moving story, that may not be all that accurate, but you will be hard pressed to find a better cast then the one they had and for that, American Gangster is labeled as a must see movie."" ]"
along-came-a-spider;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Long before Tyler Perry turned Alex Cross into an action star, the all-star detective was portrayed correctly by the legendary Morgan Freeman. While the first film, Kiss The Girls, was a huge success, it's sequel, Along Came A Spider was a bust, once again due to the fact that the strengths of the character were not utilized properly. The character of Alex Cross was created by Author, James Patterson, and has been responsible for over 20 best selling novels, because he's unlike any other cop in any other mystery series. Cross is a psychologist first, who gets inside the heads of killers. Once he knows what they're thinking and why they're acting the way they are, Cross is usually able to capture them. These stories make for terrific novels, but when transferred to the screen, producers felt that they lack the action movie goers crave. Despite a successful first appearance on screen, the producers felt that with more action and bullets, the sequel would do even better, they were wrong. When a Senator's daughter is abducted from an upscale private school, detectives are at a loss, but call Cross in when evidence and a ransom demand turn up at his house. Cross believes the criminal is using his admiration to cover up the real motives for this crime, and he needs to play into that role, in order to determine what those motives are. This was a terrific novel, but wasn't right for the screen, so much of the story was cut and replaced by the manhunt and police chases. These elements make for a more intense film, but don't do justice to the story. Alex Cross and his abilities are the story and are what make the series unique. Morgan Freeman returned hesitantly to do the sequel and he was right when he said he shouldn't have done it, mainly because it takes away from the brilliance of the first film. The producers of this movie even managed to screw up a terrific surprise ending and that really says it all. Along Came A Spider is not a bad film, it certainly has it's movements and a legendary star, but if you're a fan of the Alex Cross novels, expect to be disappointed."" ]"
blow;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

This film is based on phenomena of anesthetic awareness, something we saw for the first time, 15 years earlier in a Tales From The Crypt episode. It was a great episode and seemed like it should make a good movie, but this wasn't it. Awake moves very slowly and is pretty boring for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that it just jumps around. Hayden yelling at people who can't hear him, gets old, quickly, but it continues to go on and on and on.

A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice."" ]"

The rest of the cast was equally as good, but the story was a bit odd. Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that doesn't really fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character and it had nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs.

In my opinion, the movie is nowhere near as raunchy as it has to be. Movies like this are based on cheap laughs, and when it's PG-13 without a single boob or F bomb, it's just nothing special. By the end the film, it was just totally out of control. I should have just turned it off, but I suffered through to the end. Basically this movie was the foundation for Harold  Kumar.

The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was amazing as usual, but his character was kind of bland. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a super hero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of dull.

hoodlum;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told."" ]"

After a school residual, The Learner family stops to get gas and their 10 year old son goes to release fireflies by the side of the road. At the same time, a man returning from the Red Sox game is more interested in his cell phone than the road, and runs the young boy over. From there on the movie is as you would expect it to be. One side is devastated while the other is in cover up mode. The police investigation, vigilantism, bereavement, and the justice system get involved in what turns out to be little more than a lifetime movie of the week. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the grieving father out seeking revenge, in the kind of performance that really makes you feel for the guy, but aside from that, Reservation Road is just a very predictable film that is out for one thing, your tears. It's a sad story told from every possible angle, covering every possible thing that could happen in a situation like this, and it's definitely preaching about the dangers of distracted driving. If not for the huge cast, this could have easily been a lifetime movie, as the writing was that predictable and amateurish. The bottom line on Reservation Road is that it's a preachy, predictable, tear-jerker, without much substance, probably not worth your time unless you like that kind of thing."" ]"

He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated."" ]"

the-rock;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Yes, there was a time when Michael Bay made movies that actually had a plot to go with the explosions, and some, like The Rock, were terrific. I had never seen The Rock from beginning to end, having just caught glimpses of it on TV, but watching it in it's entirety proved what I'd long suspected, it was a great film. A Marine General, upset that his lost soldiers never received the compensation they deserved for their secret missions, takes control of Alcatraz island, and aims chemical weapons at San Francisco. The FBI is at a lost as to what to do and decide to go with an unconventional idea to try and stop the general. A team of Navy seals prepare to take the island back, lead by the only man to ever escape from Alcatraz, now in his sixties, and a chemical weapons specialist who has never been in combat. Sean Connery stars and even though he was nearing the end of his illustrious career, he gives a truly great performance, that reminds us of just how great his movies were. Connery was the premiere action star, in a time before special effects had been computerized. He really gives an old school attitude and feeling to the film, which helps The Rock stand out from it's competition. Connery is paired with Nicholas Cage who is always terrific, especially when he's playing some type of law enforcer. Cage adds humor, unintentionally, with his inexperience, and winds up doing some pretty amazing things. While I don't like to mention specific scenes in a film, I'd be remiss not to mention the incredible chase scene Cage has through the streets of San Francisco, in the beginning of the film. It was reminiscent of the great car chases of the Lethal Weapon series, and really stood out to me. The Rock is a terrific story, featuring a cast in which old school and the younger generation collide, and to top it all off, it has that Michael Bay spin and over reliance on special effects. It's a terrific action film which sadly is rarely seen anymore in the world of computer generated effects and muscle headed action stars."" ]"
jumper;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny.

For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes.

The story line was much closer to what I expected to see from this franchise, and this time, John Woo was Directing.

Tom Cruise is his usual self and the action sequences are textbook John Woo, so why is this rated 3 1/2 stars you may ask?

The story is about fighting discrimination, something many of us can easily relate to...and while the special effects are way over the top, they are most defiantly unique. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine makes the movie and his interplay with cyclops was genius. The second one is still my favorite, but this one was still really good. I highly recommend both it and the rest of the trilogy."" ]"
beyond-the-mat;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Adult professional wrestling fans aren't stupid, we know wrestling is fake and the outcomes are pre-determined. What none fans don't realize is why we like it. It's the drama, the pageantry, the cheesy stories, the costumes, and most of all the action. Yes, it's pre-determined and choreographed, but you still need to be charismatic and athletic, and night after night these guys put their bodies on the line just for our entertainment. People have been killed and paralyzed doing this, so to anyone who says it's not real and takes no skill, I point to this documentary. Beyond The Mat looks into the lives of these guys outside the ring and show the ancient Terry Funk, whose body has been ravaged from years in the ring. He can barely walk anymore, but still has to get in there and has to do this because it's all he knows and what he loves. Jake \""The Snake\"" Roberts is also featured and he talks about how eight years on the road with WWE made him a neglectful father, a bad husband, and a drug addict. Roberts says between the pain and the constant moving around he could never have done it without drugs! Finally, they look at Mick Foley AKA Mankind, Dude Love, Cactus Jack and show how he's this normal family man and while his family knows it's for show, how much they worry. In the last 30 years, hundreds of pro-wrestlers have died under the age of 45, most of them due to the physical trauma they've put their bodies through or the dependence on drugs that has resulted from it. If those were NFL or MLB stars instead, there would be massive reform and congressional intervention, but the truth is no one cares about these guys, except of course their families, friends, and fans. Beyond The Mat is important because it shows just what these guys put on the line and just how little the people at the top care."" ]"

I mean think about it, this scientist whose trying to create a super soldier tries the solution on himself, and now when he gets angry he turns into a WWE Superstar! As for the film, it's not much better. I love Edward Norton, he's a big name and a star in his own right, but he's just about the last person I would choose to be the Hulk. His whole personality wasn't right for the part. I like his co-star, Liv Tyler too, and it wasn't that she was bad in this film, it's that her role was a joke and she had absolutely no chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth was the bright spot in the movie, as he's one of those guys who can adapt to any role and I think I'd have preferred to see him as the Hulk. As for the story, parts of it were decent, but they skipped the whole part of the story that I wanted to see! The film starts five years later, in Brazil, I wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this. I hate superheroes and I hate their movies, but the Avengers stories have been different. With the exception of Thor, they have for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. The story here is lame and the movie is based on special effects which did nothing to help the film. The last half hour of the movie, I felt as though I was watching Peter Griffin fight the Big Chicken and I honestly hated every minute of it!"" ]"

I finally decided to watch it as part of a paper for my film class, because as the first adaptation of a Grisham novel, it was important to the paper, but I still can't explain why it was the first novel they decided to turn into a movie. The story follows a younger lawyer who is graduating at the top of his Harvard Law class. As the offers pour in, he has a tough decision to make, and finally settles on a small Nashville firm, that has made him an offer that is too good to be true. As he starts working for The Firm, Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) comes to realize that their only client is an organized crime syndicate and he's trapped inside. Eventually, the FBI comes to McDeere and tries to recruit him as a whistle blower, and his response is somewhat unorthodox. What I never understood about this story is why McDeere went to the lengths he did. He could have achieved the same outcome by simply complying with one side or the other. He jumps through all these hoops and does all these secretive things in order to achieve the same outcome. To me, this always made the second half of the book and film to be pretty much pointless. Tom Cruise stars and shines in the type of role that defined his early career. At this point in his career, if Tom Cruise is not starring as a dark loner or a sci-fi action hero, there isn't any point to watching his movies, but back in the early 90s he really had that special spark that has garnered him the reputation he has today. Cruise was paired with Gene Hackman, making the perfect dynamic of the old star, turning things over to the new. It was a bold move that didn't work out so well for the Indiana Jones franchise, but here it was one of the most interesting things about this film. The acting is terrific and a Grisham film is always very clever and well written, but as I said I've never been a fan of The Firm. The second half of the story just doesn't sit right with me and I'll continue to say it no matter how good the cast is."" ]"

Weather it's all part of the grand design or just abnormalities of nature, I'll never know, none of us will. This theme is explored in the novel and film, The Green Mile. How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before. The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things. The performances in this film were Oscar worthy, building on the success of their last collaboration, The Shawshank Redemption, King and Durabont, got the biggest star in Hollywood to star in this film. The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be. The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor. That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find. Like many classic films the critics love, it's a bit long, parts of it are somewhat boring, and the storyline isn't for everybody, there are plenty of people who just won't get it. I did get it and I feel the better for it. This is one of those films, love it or hate it, that everyone should see at least once."" ]"

Along with the flashbacks of his baseball memories, come flashbacks of his romance, which are long and lame. The baseball part of it is what attracted me and is great. If this was strictly a sports movie, it would be 5 stars. The story of his career is much stronger than several other films dedicated to just the game. With this film you have to take the good with the bad. At times it seems like two entirely different movies and it really takes away from what is otherwise a great film."" ]"

So, when Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd), discovers that the husband she's been convicted of killing is actually still alive, she goes on a mission to hunt him down. There is one problem though, her parole officer is determined to stop her. This is one of those films that for some reason you easily forget about. I saw Double Jeopardy when it was in the theaters and totally forgot about it, until it was on TV last week. It's only then that I remembered just how intense it is. Ashley Judd is truly a fantastic actress when she's in the right role, and trust me, a scored, lonely woman is the perfect role for her. Tommy Lee Jones has a somewhat smaller part than we are used too, but he's as amazing as he's always been. The chase for Libby easily brings back memories of Marshall Samuel Gerard. The only knock against this film is that it is unfortunately somewhat predictable, if you're looking for a shocking twist in the story, you won't find it here. The extreme nature of the story and the terrific acting more than make up for the predictability though and the film is perfect for those times where you just want to be entertained without having to think too much."" ]"

It's the story about meeting your soul mate, getting married, and the ups  downs associated with family life. There are no surprises and there is nothing special here. I didn't find the movie particularly funny and even at 96 minutes, it still felt very long. If you're into these sappy romantic comedies, you might like it, you might not.

Seldom is an action movie really focused on the story, instead it's always about the man who can do the impossible. In Too Deep was different though because it was based on a true story and there really weren't any expensive special effects. In this film, Omar Epps plays a rookie, undercover cop, whose first small assignment actually leads him into the number one crime syndicate in all of Cincinnati. The inexperienced cop uses his urban upbringing and street smarts to get him to the top, where he really has to decide which side he wants to be on. In Too Deep featured a great, real life story, that was on the level, I really enjoyed this film. On top of that Epps and LL Cool J were terrific opposing each other and giving strong performances. What I didn't care for was the blatant racism from Director Michael Rymer. Everything was very well done, but it is very obvious that the Writer/Director of this film was white, while the majority of the cast was black. What I witnessed was a film where all the people in charge were white, all the thugs were black, but it didn't end there. The white people spoke eloquently, while even the black officers and other non-affiliated cast members all spoke street. Every person from the rookie cops aging father to the man who ran the convenience store were dropping F bombs left and right, adding man to every other word, and constantly saying the N word. I understand the point of this movie was to be real, but part of that realism was that this gang had never been infiltrated because of how smart they were. Instead of being portrayed as smooth and savvy, the leaders of the gang were portrayed as ignorant thugs and that really takes away from the film."" ]"

Paranormal Activity, The Grudge, The Ring, are you kidding me?! Those movies were terrible! They don't make movies like Stir of Echoes anymore, this is a supernatural thriller, that was truly unsettling and creepy, the kind of film that defines what supernatural horror should be. Tom & Maggie are celebrating moving into a new house, and as the party is winding down, Maggie's sister claims to know something about the supernatural. Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a complete skeptic, so she offers to hypnotize him and see what happens. Reluctantly Tom agrees and after seeing some strange flashes, Tom wakes up unsettled but still a non-believer. Over the next few weeks, Tom continues to see strange images of a girl asking for his help and believes his sister in-law messed with his mind somehow. Once convinced that she had nothing to do with it, Tom decides to investigate and try to find out, who this girl is and why she's asking for help. This movie is truly scary because depending on what you believe in, this could be 100% real. Kevin Bacon is one of those actors who when he is in the right role is better than anyone, and this role is perfect for him. Bacon had me on the edge of my seat and it seemed as thou this movie just flew by. I wanted to know who this girl was and what happened to her just as much as he did. As for the paranormal stuff, it wasn't bloody, gory, and out of nowhere but it was just as creepy. This is the kind of film that left you jittery and uneasy for hours afterwards, the definitive horror movie. Bad reviews had me skeptical, but I am a skeptic no longer, Stir of Echoes will most definitely be included in my next Halloween movie marathon!"" ]"

Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs  Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties."" ]"

Adams believes that patients need to be treated not just for their physical ailments, but also for their emotional well being. He also believes that like freedom of speech, healthcare is an inalienable human right that should be provided to everyone. This is a film that was written specifically for and with the help of Robin Williams. While Adams himself admitted that much of it was inaccurate, the film fulfills it's message, by using an extreme mix of emotion and humor. While watching this film you'll go between tears of laughter and tears of sadness, in a film that will really hit home with a lot of people. This is what Robin Williams was known for, he told his stories and got his messages out, while at the same time entertaining and inspiring people to be the best that they could be. If any other actor had played Patch, it probably would have been a slow moving drama, that just made everyone sad, but Williams made the story one that made you think and it sticks with you. As it recent weeks it has come to light that Williams himself was sick, and this may be the reason he took his own life, I can't help but wonder if on that night, had he watched this film, would the outcome have been different?"" ]"
varsity-blues;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""A movie about a high school football team, created by MTV, starring all the teen-heartthrobs of the late 90s, I couldn't have been more uninterested. For 17 years, I avoided seeing this film, I figured it would be a steaming pile full of good looking people with their shirts off, but after catching the ending on TV, I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. In Texas, football is everything, even at the high school level. The West Canaan Coyotes are one of the best teams in the state, thanks to a hard nosed, old school coach, and an NFL bound Quarterback, but their perfect season takes a turn when the Quarterback goes down with a serious knee injury. The Coyotes are left in the hands of John Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a kid who hasn't taken a snap in three years, who is only on the team because of his father. The coach hates him, the town doubts him, but something amazing happens when Mox is on the field, he's actually good. James Van Der Beek stars and honestly, I always felt that he was too much into the whole teen-heartthrob persona, I never took him seriously as an actor, or envisioned him being good in a role like this. Just as the town was surprised by how good Mox was on the field, I was just as surprised by how good Van Der Beek was in this role. When you add Jon Voight to the equation, as the hard nosed coach, things really come together. The two men hate each other, but are forced to work together, it's this dynamic and tension behind the scenes that really makes the off the field action as interesting as what's taking place on the field. Varsity Blues is produced by MTV, stars actors I normally wouldn't watch, and as it turns out it is one of the most exciting and intense sports films I've ever seen. One of the things I love about films, is that you can never judge them based on anything else other than their content. On the surface, this is something I'd never watch, but happenstance brought me to it, and it's honestly one of the best football movies I've ever seen."" ]"

Not to say that the first isn't a classic film, but the second one has two things the first lacked. First, Director, Renny Harlan, who is the master of action films, completely unappreciated, and a man who has given me hours of excitement. The second thing is the supporting cast, which features the likes of Dennis Franz from NYPD Blue, Fred Thompson of Law n' Order, and of course veteran character actor, William Sadler. Willis once again is brilliant as John McClain and gave the 90's a true action hero! The Die Hard films are the frame work by which all modern action films are compared and if you skipped the second one, because it was a sequel, you're an idiot!

Personally, I think this just adds to the suspense and helps build to an expected climax, which had unexpected results for everyone involved. Nicholas Cage plays Rick Santoro perfectly, its a role that at the time seemed as thou it could be a bit of a stretch for him, but as always he is terrific.

An overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and Kevin gets left home alone. At the same time, a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house. Kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it. As his parents rush to get back to him, Kevin prepares for war! Home Alone is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be. These films all claim to be fun for the whole family, but lets face it, they're geared toward children. Most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in you're on your phone or falling asleep, but not here. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Macaulay Culkin is fantastic. We all know Pesci for his mobster roles, so it's easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor, and it is actually what he does best. Paired with a great cast, a legendary director, and a terrific story, this is simply the best family feature film I have ever seen. Home Alone has something for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry, and beg for more, and that's why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film, but as I said earlier there will only ever be one Home Alone and it is an absolute must see movie!"" ]"

When the film was made it was a huge risk for the production company, as it was extremely expensive, and featured a first a time Director, using a new kind of computerized effects. 15 years later and the film is considered to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made. For those unfamiliar with the story, it takes place 200 years in the future, a time where machines have taken control of the planet and 99% of humans live in blissful ignorance, as pawns in stasis, living out there lives in a dreamworld called the Matrix. The other 1% know the truth and will do whatever it takes to defeat the machines. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leads the charge, following an ancient prophecy, that says they will one day discover a human with extraordinary abilities, that will lead to the destruction of the Matrix. That man is named Neo and is played by Keanu Reeves, in what many consider to be his crowning achievement. Reeves is often put down for being too dark and emotionless in his roles, but that is exactly what the role of Neo calls for, making Reeves the perfect choice to play him. Reeves is paired with veteran actor Laurence Fishburne, who as Morpheus, is like the pope of this new world. He is the one who discovered the prophecy and who risks everything for Neo. The story of the Matrix is one of the most original to come alone in decades, featuring a perfectly cast group of actors, who are aided by special effects, the likes of which had never been seen before. These effects are common place in 2014, but were unheard of in 1999, and really helped cement the reputation of this classic. The Matrix may not be the perfect movie and in fact, a lot of people won't understand it, but it's a film that people will be watching 200 years from now, when the events of the film supposedly take place."" ]"

As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter.

In general, I find these huge franchise films to be fun, some are better than others, but that's usually based on the writing and the cast. In watching the first of the Mission: Impossible films, my expectations were very high, and while Tom Cruise didn't disappoint, Brian De Palma certainly did. The king of mystery could have developed a better story than this. The action sequences were impressive and the special effects were way over the top, but I still felt the story could have been developed a lot more. Maybe being the first film in an eventual franchise, producers wanted to give the series as much action and explosions as possible. If that was the case, they should have called Michael Bay, this film has all the makings of one of his films, not a De Palma film.

Robin Williams stars as Professor John Keating, an unconventional teacher who inspired his students to push the boundaries of the way they think. Keating's students worship him and reform the old club he was a founding member of as a student, The Dead Poets Society. Keating's unconventional thinking pushes his students, but the question is will it push some of them too far from the norm, at their strict boarding school? The performances makes this film, as you will see some amazing things. As for the story, it really isn't anything more than a means to present the characters. When you take away the performances, the truth is that this film is about a traditional boarding school, an English class, and a poetry club, not the most interesting of stories. Dead Poets Society is rather slow moving and one begins to question just how meaningful a club like this would be, especially in today's digital world. When it comes to Dead Poets Society, I loved the performances, but wasn't crazy about the film as a whole. I think the storyline is lacking, the characters aren't as unconventional as they could have been, and things move much too slowly for mainstream audiences. That being said, if you are a movie lover, this film is like It's A Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane in that it may not be the best of films, but it is a part of cinematic history that must be scene for it's undeniably outstanding performances and it's contribution to the history of film."" ]"
a-bronx-tale;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear."" ]"

That's the point of this film, very wisely and overlooked, Spike Lee is saying who cares what color the person is, step up and do the right thing in every situation. It's a message we should all take to heart."" ]"

Confidential is loaded with star power and filmed in a style of films thirty years it's senior. Based on a true story, Three L.A. Detectives, with different reputations and personalities, team up to solve a brutal murder that involves one of their own. The film is loaded with twists and turns that will lead you down many different paths and thanks to the quality of the acting, it's all believable. Just how good was this movie? In 1998, it received NINE Academy nominations, one of the highest number of nominations ever. L.A. Confidential also put Russell Crowe on the map. This film is an extremely exciting 'who done it' mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. The story is top notch, the acting is just about as good as it gets, and you will be hard pressed to find a better mystery. I can't possibly recommend this film enough!"" ]"
timecop;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""It's a rare occurrence, but once in a while, a film is made that is way ahead of it's time, too far ahead of it's time, and Timecop is one of those films. Had it been made in the error of CGI, this film would have been so much better. The story is strong, a lot stronger than the performances, and the use of some crazy special effects would have taken it over the top, but those weren't available in 1994. The result is a slightly above average film, with a really cool plot, and not much else. The story follows Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme) whose job is to stop people from using illegal time travel technology, in order to change the past. Changing the past can drastically change the present, and is often abused by criminals trying to get wealth and power. One of those men is U.S. Senator McComb (Ron Silver), who has his eye on the Presidency. Walker must go back in time to stop McComb and expose him, before he can reshape the country in his own image. I love time oriented Science Fiction, as the story can take you on a magical trip all throughout history, like nothing else can. In this film, they didn't travel as much as they should have, and the technology and effects behind time travel were so basic, that it's hard to buy that this could ever work. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars and we all know that I see him as one of these brawn over brains guys, that only get work because of their looks and their fancy movies. Van Damme wasn't bad, but this is a film that had real potential, and simply using an average star, contributes to the overall sentiment of the film. Timecop is a great story, and in my opinion is something that could really work if it is re-made properly. It's not because the film is bad, it's just not a good as it should have been. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, I definitely recommend it, but if it's not your favorite genre, you might want to skip this one."" ]"

There are hundreds of books and stories they could have chosen from, and I suspect most of them would have been better than the Crystal Skull. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad, but aliens, Elvis, sword fights on the back of a jeep, cannibalistic ants, and Shia swinging through the Amazon with a family of monkeys? That's not Indiana Jones. I realize they wanted to portray him in perhaps the final years of his career, but the story was not great. The action scenes, effects, stunts, and cast were all great, and what you've come to expect from Indy, but the movie itself wasn't the best. It's enjoyable and worth seeing, but for the most part it doesn't fit with what we know of Indiana Jones."" ]"

Casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in Las Vegas in two very different ways. De Niro is Ace Rothstein, the man with the plan. He always made money, but since he was Jewish, he was never fully trusted. Pesci is of course, Nicky Santoro, the tough guy who says  seven thousand times, while doing things his own way.

Al Pacino is of course amazing, he's pretty much amazing in everything he does, but as far as the film goes, its centered on this masochistic **** who was never happy with what he had. Tony Montana, was never a hero or someone who was meant to be looked up to as one of the greatest characters of all time. As far as Mob films go, Scarface is so much easier to follow then most, as the timeline makes sense, and you're not introduced to new people every five minutes. While Al Pacino is terrific, the mumbled lines and enormous greed leave something to be desired. Not to mention that when you break things down, isn't the film really just business meeting, gunfight, personal life, repeat? After a while the film feels like it's going around in circles and really is kind of stale. People will always remember this film for it's epic finally, taglines, and the great Al Pacino, but as far as stories go, this one isn't something I would consider a classic or a can't miss film. Scarface has it's moments and has to be at the top of the list for action junkies, but beyond that, I found the story to be just your run of the mill mafia tale, focused on a guy, who was too greedy and too stupid to hold onto everything he worked so hard for."" ]"

sleepers;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close."" ]"
soul-men;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Soul Men was a film that was racked with problems right from the start. Originally the film kept getting pushed back because of a law suit by the R&B group, Sam  David, which claimed it to be a farce on their life story. The group also accused the producers of copyright infringement for using their style and the title of one of their songs, \""Soul Man\"". The law suit was finally settled and the movie was released in 2008. Then, days before the films release, two of it's stars, Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, died on back to back days, a tragedy that created a public relations nightmare. For those reasons, this film wasn't widely distributed or advertised, which is a shame because it was one terrific film. The story starts 30 years after a legendary R&B group, Marcus Hooks  The Real Deal, broke up. We see the remaining members, Samuel L. Jackson in trouble with the law, and Bernie Mac, living in a retirement community, when they learn about the sudden death of Hooks. Record executives, quick to capitalize on his death, organize a tribute show at the Apollo in New York, and invite the Real Deal to participate. This means that two men who hate each other and haven't performed in almost 30 years, need to get their act together in a hurry if they want the big pay day and a chance at a come back. The film is an absolute riot, with Mac as the old lonely man and Jackson as the bitter forgotten convict. Their chemistry was nothing short of amazing and the big surprise was that both men can actually sing and dance! Even though they must have said mother f'er about a thousand times, I found the film to be very clever, funny, and original. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching."" ]"

One night, after multiple officers are shot and killed, it becomes clear that there is a large corruption ring at work within the NYPD, and the brass turn to Ray to find out the truth, a truth that could lead him right back home. Edward Norton is truly a chameleon in that he can play absolutely any role and be believable. It doesn't matter if he's some computer geek or a tough as nails cop, he always does a great job and no matter what he's in, the film is always going to have an air of credibility for it. The rest of the cast, as well as the story are also pretty good, but this film isn't without it's problems. As with other films that have complex stories and large casts, the story moves so quickly and characters are introduced so fast, that it's difficult to keep track of what's going on and nearly impossible to remember who is who. The story is great and the main characters are well written, but there is so much going on, that it is very easy to get lost in all the side stories. The bottom line is that Pride and Glory would be better suited as a TV series than a movie, but then you wouldn't have the big named cast, and it probably wouldn't last four episodes. The actions scenes are great, the main characters are intense, and the story was terrific if not a bit more complicated than it needed to be."" ]"
blade-runner;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Blade Runner is widely considered to be the best Science Fiction movie ever made. It is on almost every top 100 list, and that's why I am reviewing it. To tell you why it is one of the most overrated films of all time. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, and the author of Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite authors, but Blade Runner is far from his best work. I would go as far as saying that Blade Runner isn't even in his top ten, and if it wasn't for Ridley Scott, it wouldn't have been the first film adaptation of Dick's work. At the time, the special effects were innovative and exciting, but they fail to live up to today's standards. With that being said, all that's left over is a simple story that follows a futuristic police chase and a very cheesy, awkward, love story. In a futuristic Los Angeles, android technology has been perfected. These replicants are used for labor an odd jobs, but occasionally, they become aware and try to run for their freedom. That is when the blade runners are called in to eliminate them. The best Blade Runner around is Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man who doesn't love his job, but always gives one hundred and ten percent. After three replicants escape from the moon, Deckard is called in to track them down and this is the whole premise of the movie. There isn't much of a side story and the rare breaks in the action, rarely prove to be substantive. The film is just you're typical chase with some very weird elements. For example, why does Rutger Hauer take off all his cloths before he fights Harrison Ford, and for that matter, what the hell is he talking about the whole time? How about the talking toys, can you tell me they weren't just a bit creepy and out of character for the rest of the film? Finally, we're in Los Angeles, why is everything Chinese? The story is just a very strange chase through a futuristic nightmare scenario for Los Angeles. Yes, Harrison Ford was terrific, and yes, it must of been the hardest thing Ridley Scott ever had to direct, but the film and story itself are very simplistic and certainly not worthy of legendary status. I love Philip K. Dick and I am obsessed with Science Fiction, but watching Blade Runner for the third time, I was still just as bored and confused as I was the other two times I saw it. How can anything that makes a person feel that way be considered legendary?"" ]"

From its raunchy plot to it's great one liners, to it's awesome cameos, Zack  Miri is two hours of pure comic genius. Seth Rogan  Elizabeth Banks have amazing chemistry together, it seemed as thou they've been working together for years, despite only doing one other movie together.

What Doesn't Kill You is the story of two brothers, who grow up in poverty and whom turned to organized crime to survive. For fifteen years, they did what they were told, but with the boss on his way to prison, they decide to go off on their own. Admittedly, it's a tremendous story that follows the paths of these brothers over  the course of the next few years, the problem was that in this movie, years translate into about 10 minute intervals. Instead of giving us a complete and accurate portrayal, the director decided to cut the story into small fragments, usually no longer than a minute or two. Something is said, something happens, and then were on to another something, when? where? who knows!? The movie moved so fast and was so choppy, that it left my head spinning. Despite the confusion, it was pretty entertaining and Mark Ruffalo gives an unbelievable performance. Here's another example of a guy I've seen around, never thought much of, who randomly shows up in a B-movie and just makes the whole film worth watching. If you're able to keep up, and this movie doesn't confuse you into an absolute stupor, it's not bad. The story is solid, the cast is good, and it has it's moments, but again only if you can get passed the ridiculous pace the director has decided to set for us."" ]"

echelon-conspiracy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""For the first 40 minutes, I was mesmerized by this film. The beginning was as thrilling and intriguing as any film I'd seen all year, but after that, the big secret is revealed and it became almost a shot for shot remake of Eagle Eye. It was seriously ridiculous how the two stories became almost exactly alike. Realizing this, the writers decided to throw in a big twist at the end, that might have saved the film had it made even a single bit of sense. Echelon Conspiracy begins with computer programer, Max Petersen (Shane West), anonymously receiving a brand new, state of the art, cell phone in the mail. The phone gives him instructions which lead to him winning a lot of money. Everything is going great for Max, until he disobeys the phones wishes and the FBI shows up. Shane West was fantastic in this film, it really makes me wonder why he doesn't do more stuff like this. West seems to prefer romantic dramas, but is clearly missing his true calling. After seeing a performance like this, I'd easily put him at the top of the list for any major action film. West was paired in this film with Edward Burns who was terrific and Ving Rhames who was Ving Rhames. I say that, because sometimes he's the perfect fit for a role and other times, he couldn't be more out of place, a perfect example of which is his role in this film. As I said, this movie starts out great, but becomes exactly like Eagle Eye, I would venture to say that the two films are so much a like that the producers of Eagle Eye have a case for copyright infringement, it really was that close. Besides that, the film was a decent action film, with some nice performances. Had I not seen Eagle Eye, I may have thought more of this film, but as it stands, Echelon Conspiracy is just another low budget rip off of a semi-decent major motion picture and not much else."" ]"

Jimmy Bennett was also really good playing her adoptive brother, he even did his own stunts. Every time I see this kid he gets better and better, and I think you'll be seeing his name in films for the next fifty years.

Tom Hanks is once again terrific, bringing an intensity that few others can match.

It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life. I enjoyed every second of this film and it was truly the best choice the Academy could have made for best picture."" ]"

It's not that Public Enemies was a bad movies, but a lot of people panned it because they expected a lot more from a 100 million dollar movie, starting Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, and they have a point. The story was flawed right from the beginning because the true story behind it really wasn't that interesting. The filmmakers tried to get people to watch it, by saying that Dillinger and Purvis were comparable to Capone and Ness, but that's not true. In reality, they had almost no interaction with each other and in the movie, whenever they were together, all they did was shoot at each other. There wasn't any chemistry between them, because their supposed rivalry was a fictions element added to an otherwise true story. The film should have focused on infamous bank robber, John Dillinger, but instead it focuses on the FBI hunt for him and his life on the run, long after the bulk of his crimes had been committed. Johnny Depp portrays Dillinger in an attempt to go back to being a legitimate actor instead of a Disney puppet, and he fails miserably. This guy can be one hell of actor, when the role fits his personality, but John Dillinger does not. Depp is an emotionless mess of mumbled lines that almost completely destroy the film. Thankfully, Christian Bale was much better and far more interesting. Public Enemies had big expectations, an all-star cast, and a huge budget, but it turned out to be an average film. That's what had people so upset, because had this been an independent film, they would have been okay with it. The fact that Public Enemies was billed as the next Untouchables, but fails to deliver even a single memorable scene just destroys any credibility the film had going for it."" ]"

For all you haters out there, the one thing you can't deny is Tarantino's unique ability to bring out the best in everyone he works with, and that is why many times, the cast members of his films earn Oscar nominations. Inglourious Basterds is another uniquely strange story that just works, because of Tarantino. As has become his signature, the story is broken up into seemingly unrelated stories that all come together in a terrific ending. The story centers around a group of Jewish-American soldiers in World War II, whose assignment was to go into France, undercover, and track down and slaughter Nazis. It's a terrific cast led by Brad Pitt, but to me he wasn't so much the star of this film, that honor belongs to Christopher Waltz, who in his first major role, did win the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a strong story and a great film, but something bothered me about it. Inglourious Basterds is of course a fictional story, so the attention to detail, such as having everyone speaking in their native languages, seemed someone unnecessary to me. That combined with subtitles that moved at the speed of light, made the story somewhat hard for me to follow. That's why I watched it a few times before reviewing it. There is no denying that this is one hell of a story with another tremendous cast, that deserved every award that it's won, however Tarantino's attention to detail, usually a strength, did take away from the film, as a whole, and did make some parts difficult to follow."" ]"

Peter Jackson signed on to Direct and Steven Spielberg was the Executive Producer, so the budget for this film was massive, but it didn't do so well, leading people to believe it was a bad movie. While it was different from what the readers expected, the film was still better than average. The story is told by Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14 year old girl, who was murdered. Susie introduces us to her family and to her killer in what I saw as a mix between Ghost and What Dreams May Come. The story is extremely strong and very well written, but it isn't without it's problems. For instance, we learn the identity of the murderer almost immediately. There are also huge gaps in the story between when we see Susie in purgatory and when we see her families again. Saorise Ronan plays Susie and continues to amaze me. I honestly haven't been that crazy about most of the films I've seen her in, but she never seizes to amaze me. It really is only a matter of time until she's in the right film and gets national attention. By then, not only will people know her name, but they'll know how to pronounce it too. She is supported by some big names like Stanley Tucci, who at this point in his career has convinced me that he can play just about any role. The Lovely Bones is a great story, but it wasn't done in a way that appeals to mass audiences. The scenes in purgatory were never ending and there are big holes in the story, but the cast is terrific and the story is really good. If you're into films that stray from the norm, you might really enjoy this one."" ]"
love-ranch;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Love Ranch is a fictionalized bio-pic, loosely based on the true story of Joe & Sally Conforte. The Conforte's were the first people to open a legalized brothel in the state of Nevada and for a while, became local celebrities, until it all came crashing down. It was an interesting story, following the lives of two people, that most of us don't know anything about. As for the film, while it over-dramatized a lot of the events, it really fails to make much of an impact. There are scenes that make these two look like gangsters, others that make them look like royalty, and several that just makes them look like trailer trash. The truth is that it was hard to really decipher the true character of these people and figure out what they were really like. I was mildly interested in the story, but what I really wanted to see was the return of Joe Pesci. Since retiring in 1999, Pesci had a cameo in one film, but this is was his first leading role since Lethal Weapon 4. For the living legend, it was as if he had never stopped, giving a terrific performance. The only disappointing thing was that they kept Pesci's classic, profanity laced tirades to a minimum, but other than that, he was really terrific. Helen Mirren on the other hands kind of annoyed me in this film. She's always been an amazing actress, but her performance was really all over the place. I guess it has to do with the emotional state of the woman she was playing, but to be honest I was very unimpressed by what I saw from her. While it was great to see Joe Pesci back on the big screen, the Love Ranch was really just a mass of confusion that was all over the place. It was nearly impossible to separate the truth from the Hollywood bull **** when personalities and situations are changing so rapidly. If you love Joe Pesci, you won't want to miss his comeback, but the film that brought him out of retirement, really isn't anything special."" ]"

It also features Charlie Tahan, who is one of the biggest up and coming stars around. Charlie St. Cloud also has some awesome cameos and let's face it, Zac Efron was pretty good in 17 again, so I took a chance. Sadly though, even with all the film apparently had going for it, Charlie St. Cloud was a boring flop. The story follows a young man's journey to re-discover himself following a drunk driving accident that claimed the life of his little brother. It's a solid story to build on, but that's just it, it really doesn't go anywhere from there. Charlie is consumed by what happened and even years later spends hours in the woods talking to his brothers ghost. If you watch the first fifteen minutes of the movie, there really all there is to see. It had a lot of potential and fairly good cast, but honestly I found the film to be boring and really  depressing."" ]"

twelve;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Gossip Girl meets Limitless in this clever, fast-paced, independent drama by Joel Shumacher. The story follows Manhattan's elite teenage population and illustrates how even the wealthy aren't immune to the problems of the big city. The film has a ton of characters and is cleverly narrated by Kiefer Sutherland, who helps us keep everything straight. Twelve refers to a new designer drug on the street and the film centers around High School drop out, White Mike (Chance Crawford), who is connected to just about every one. Forced by unforeseen circumstance, White Mike has become their dealer and has all the dirt on these elite people. As for the story, it's a complicated, winding tale, that I honestly found to be intriguing. Crawford is phenomenal as the center piece to everything and finally proves that's he's not just a pretty face. A former model, Crawford has gained popularity as one of the leads in Gossip Girl and it has been said, on more than one occasion, that his looks are the reason, but he proves them all wrong with a gutsy and amazing performance in Twelve. As for the rest of the cast, it's such an amazing random mix of people that you can't help but fall in love with it. In Twelve, there are appearances from everyone from 50 cent to Macaulay Culkin's little brother, Dewey from Malcolm In The Middle, and even Lenny Kravitz's daughter. You never know whose going to show up and what their story might be. Twelve is one of the smartest and most innovative dramas I've seen in years and has earned the rare honor of being called a can't miss film!"" ]"

This is one of those movies that's hard to describe without giving stuff away, so let me just say, it's Shyamalan at his best! It's a great story, a young unknown cast, and the ending will just blow your mind. Unlike most Horror/Thriller writers, Shyamalan doesn't use gore to shock you, but rather has a story that will just scare you to your core, and by the end of this one I was rattled!

conviction;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""A lot of film are made that are based on a true story, and most of these films claim to be inspirational, but seldom are. Finding a truly inspirational film, that is based on a true story, is like finding a needle in a haystack, in this case, that needle is called Conviction. Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) came from a dysfunctional family, dropped out of High School, got married, and had kids, while she was still a child herself. She never wanted to be anything more than a housewife, until her brother, Kenneth (Sam Rockwell), was convicted of a murder she knew he couldn't have committed. It took fifteen long years, but Betty Anne got her GED, finished college, and went to law school, with the hopes of one day getting her brother exonerated. Hilary Swank stars and thrives in roles like this one. Despite her beauty and talent, she is one of the most down to earth people in Hollywood, and is always very believable as a normal, every day person. In most of her films, she is the kind of person audiences empathize with and cheer for, making her perfect for this role. She is paired with Sam Rockwell who is one of the most underrated stars in Hollywood. The man has immense talent, but is seldom talked about, because of the awful films he decides to star in. I have admired Rockwell for a long time, but this is the first time I can remember rating a film he was in higher than three stars. Conviction is a real story, written by the people who lived through it. It is heartfelt, inspirational, and most importantly real. The film may have bombed in theaters, but it is a true gem that was seriously overlooked."" ]"
nowhere-boy;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Nowhere Boy is the critically acclaimed story of John Lennon's adolescence and the formation of the Beatles. The film was a culmination of several biographies of Lennon, along with firsthand accounts from friends and family. Aaron Johnson was utterly fantastic as Lennon, giving a very strong performance. People were genuinely surprised when he was cast, being that he's not British, but it's not an issue. As for the film, in all honesty, until Lennon meets McCartney, the film is kind of slow. After that, it picks up a little bit, but jumps around quite a bit and gets to be rather confusing. I'm convinced that I only enjoyed this film, because it's subject is someone I greatly admired and someone I wanted to know more about. The performances were top notch and I did learn a lot about John Lennon and the Beatles, but overall this film was a little dry."" ]"

Despite its original title and awful special effects, Monsters, is not a bad story. It is however another example of a writer, using science fiction, to promote his own agenda and bigotry. The infected zone is Mexico and you're safe once you get to America. How about the largest man made structure in the world? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA. As for the acting, it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good, but whom are easily overlooked. It's because Monsters is one of those movies, where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. It had good potential, but was just painfully boring...unless of course you enjoy octopus ****ing."" ]"

Metro-sexual Ethan didn't have the same shock value and loveable loser quality as Alan did, I didn't find him funny, I just felt sorry for him. The plot didn't help the film much either. How many times have you seen two strangers, thrown together by happenstance taking a road trip together?

Chloe Moretz was amazing as Abby, following her role in Kick-Ass, this girl is definitely going places. I didn't like Abby much thou. I found her very manipulative, not to mention how creepy it is that an ageless vampire, who looks like a little girl, is hooking up with a 12 yrs old kid. While the critics loved this film, I saw it as a dark, slower, more gory version of Twilight, except with younger kids. To be honest with you, the whole thing kind of just weirded me out."" ]"

Upon awaking, no one knows who he is, not even his wife, but worse than that, there is another person walking around claiming to be Martin Harris. I don't know about you, but after three Taken movies and a handful of similar film, all starring Liam Neeson, playing the same type of character in the same type of situations, I've gotten pretty tired of him and his particular set of skills. At least the Taken movies moved at a reasonable pace and had more than a narrow focus, the same can't be said for Unknown. Parts of this film are as slow as can be, featuring Neeson and company sitting around talking about what could be going on and what to do before they show them doing it. They story is also so narrowly focused, that it leaves little flexibility for anything else. This film is as serious as it gets, it is a hundred percent focused on the story at all times, and Liam Neeson is as dry as the banks of the Colorado River. The chase scenes were cool, the conspiracy around everything was well written, but all in all this film feels very long and moves way too slowly for an action thriller, not to mention, I think I speak for everyone when I say we've had more than enough of Liam Neeson in these type of films."" ]"

With a Dick story, you know to expect certain things. A love story, some really cool special effects, and an ending that can lead you anywhere. The Adjustment Bureau doesn't disappoint, following the Dick model to the letter,  the story is solid, unique, and imaginative. The lead, Matt Damon, gives you exactly what you'd expect out of him. Emily Blunt along side, gives an equally strong performance. The one knock on the film has to be its single mindedness. The objective never changes and the Congressman's love for Elise, a woman he hardly knows, is borderline obsessive. It is a little slow and narrow minded, but overall it's a great story and far from predictable."" ]"
scream-4;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Let's face it, when a film franchise makes it to a fourth film or higher, it usually sucks. What else can they really do with it and what's left of the story to tell us that we don't already know? That was my thinking going into Scream 4, but when it comes to Wes Craven, you really never know what you're going to get. After pumping out three movies in four years, Craven took eleven years off before taking another crack at Scream, thinking why not make what's old new again, and it works! Scream 4 continues the legacy of the series by combining a classic slasher film with the technology and youth of today, who are still making a mockery of the whole situation. The screenwriting is absolutely genius, as is evident by the opening scene, which actually rivals the scene in the first film. In Scream 4, we see a grown up Sidney Prescott return home to Woodsboro a changed woman. She's there to promote her new book and catch up with her old friends, Sheriff Dewey and his wife Gail. They're all having a nice reunion, on what turns out to be the anniversary of the first killings, when all of a sudden things turn ugly again. You know the characters and you know the actors playing them. They're a little bit older, they're a little bit wiser, and they're every bit as energetic and interesting as they were in the first three films. The old school Woodsboro family meets the current Woodsboro family and what you get is something that's very similar, but oddly different. Scream 4 is witty, clever, and updated. Wes Craven was right, what was old is new again and it reminded me of just how much I loved the original films."" ]"
source-code;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I love movies that make you think, and Source Code will do that, the problem is, that what you're thinking is probably what's going to happen. This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best performances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the way that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out."" ]"

It was however produced by Judd Apatow, and that alone made me give it a chance. Basically, Bridesmaids is a girls version of The Hangover meets Knocked Up, with an almost trip to Vegas and without the hangover. Kristen Wiig is the writer and star of this film and she was great! I'd never even heard of her before this film came out, but after seeing it, I want a lot more. It seems pretty hard for a woman to make it in comedy, it's a fairly rare event, but she's got a tremendous future ahead of her. As for the story it's pretty solid, it's a comedy, so you're not really looking for realism, just something cohesive that you can follow and this definitely fits the bill. If you're looking for something funny, but different, I'd highly recommend this film."" ]"

Not only can this kid act, but he's a martial arts expert too! The story is super strong and he is supported by some great veteran character actors, like Sigourney Weaver. The story follows a boy, who while doing a school project, finds a picture of himself on a missing person website. It leads him into an unbelievable story, full of twists and turns. It's unbelievable, yes...but still good! It's an action film, with a very solid background story and some fairly big names. Don't let the big name Teen Idol starring in it, keep you away.

When the series started, both John Cho and Kal Penn were virtual newcomers, but now they've been in some big films and TV shows. The pair are much better actors than they were in the first film and are better equipped to pull off the ridiculousness. In their third film, Harold and Kumar have actually been estranged for a while. When a mysterious package shows up for Harold at Kumar's apartment, the two are brought back together and are forced to work together to solve a problem. Everything you saw in the first two films and everything you've come to love about Harold & Kumar are back, including THE Neil Patrick Harris. There aren't many surprises here, by now you basically know what you're going to get with these films. What is new, is the Director, Todd Strauss, who actually does add a few interesting things to the film. Harold and Kumar is a lot of laughs, in a ridiculous story, filled with drugs,  and alcohol. If you didn't like the first two films, you won't like this one any better, but for what it's worth, I dare you to watch it and tell me you didn't laugh out loud at least once."" ]"

In that film and in several others that have since followed, Montiel has shown an amazing ability to take little known stories from his neighborhood, and in amazing detail, tells those stories from multiple angles, introducing the world to complex and amazing stories that to the world, were nothing but a blurbs in the newspaper decades ago. The Son of No One is one of such story, and while it is an amazing one, with an outstanding cast, it's Montiel's attention to detail that ultimately comes back to bite him. Jonathan White (Channing Tatum) has become a New York City Police Officer and he has done so at a somewhat older age than most other people do. There is a bit of a learning curve, but White seems to be catching on quickly, but his education comes to a quick halt when he and his family start receiving messages claiming to know that White killed two people in cold blood. The story here was terrific and unbelievably true, not to mention the cast was impeccable, so what's with the low rating? As I said, Motiel's films are always very detail oriented and focus on all the angles, The Son of No One is no different, however, in this case, they spend to much time on the back story in flashbacks. There isn't enough focus on the events taking place in present day, and when Channing Tatum is on screen, he's usually doing nothing that relates to the case, i.e. arguing with his wife, talking to his partner, learning to be a cop. By the time we get the end, it seems to jump out of nowhere, as if forty-five minutes of the film is just missing somehow. Not to mention the flashbacks are also out of order, further confusing the story. I understand artistic license, but this isn't Pulp Fiction and I was confused for much of this film. That being said, the cast is still terrific and Dito Montiel is one of the most underrated writer/directors in Hollywood. The Son of No One is a miss, but don't let that turn you off to the rest of amazing body of work."" ]"

The special effects in this film were really some of the best I've ever seen and the star of the film, Chris Hemsworth was amazing, but besides that, this film was extremely overrated. Thor is banished to Earth for disobeying his father, the King, and must live as a mortal. Surprisingly, it doesn't take him very long to adjust, and he falls in love with Natalie Portman during a fifteen minute car ride. Okay, so the plot was weak to begin with, but the special effects could have more than made up for that. What I really didn't like about this film was just how fast everything happened. Thor is going to be in the Avengers trilogy and there is a good possibility there may be a sequel to this film, so what was the point in rushing everything? The character of Thor is a majestic one. He is one of the most powerful superheroes that ever existed. This film should have been the epic classic that was talked about for years, but instead they rushed the story and hid behind some great special effects. It was visually impactful, entertaining, and had a great star, but a side from that, this film is nothing more than a common theme with a weak script."" ]"

The story is refreshingly unique and the film is done very well. Justin Timberlake stars, and shows that he's come a long way in a short time. When I heard he was starring in this film, I thought it would be another great idea destroyed by a cast of good looking people who can't act, but I was wrong. Timberlake shows he's got definite potential to be a big action star and that his n'suck days are way behind him. Cillian Murphy is also terrific as the timekeeper. What I love about Murphy is even when he's a good guy, he's still the guy you're rooting against. His personality makes him the perfect adversary in just about everything he does.

Unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see, The Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title, and follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a party, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help and decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that can get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational, not to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen all year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big upside.

It gets even more difficult when you're joking about things you're not supposed to joke about. In 50/50, Seth Rogan is the best friend/comic relief and while he's hilarious as always, it doesn't really fit with the tone of the film. For the most part, 50/50 is an inspiring story about a young man fighting for his life. While the writer tries to use comedy to lighten the mood, I felt that all it did was distract me from the story and bring the quality of the picture down. As always, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was absolutely incredible and continues to be the most talented and underrated actor in all of Hollywood, but I guess that's what happens when you get your start on an overrated sitcom. Those looking for another hysterical Rogan/Pot inspired comedy will be disappointed by this film, and those looking for a touching drama, may also be disappointed by the inappropriateness of it all. I liked the film a lot, even though it tries to blend two things into one, rather unsuccessfully. Simply put JGL makes this film, Rogan doesn't fit, and there's only about a 50/50 chance you're going to enjoy it."" ]"

An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a  old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating!

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story.

I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two."" ]"

Unfortunately, this film couldn't have been more ridiculous. Action movies are by nature unrealistic, but most of the time, at least some of the story is believable and makes sense. Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell. The cast was talented and the previews were good, but this movie is not. Man On A Ledge is just one of those movies that makes you question how stupid  like this even gets made in the first place."" ]"

I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband."" ]"
we-need-to-talk-about-kevin;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Americans are fascinated with criminals, and most films about them either focus on the criminal or on the people who are trying to catch them. With the recent uptake in school shootings, the one element that is often overlooked is the parents and what, if any, their role is in all of this. That is the focus of award winning film, We Need To Talk About Kevin. Kevin (Ezra Miller) has always been an angry, troubled kid, brought up by an upper middle class family. Kevin had a loving family, everything he could ever want, but still orchestrated a horrific mass shooting at his school. Despite all evidence to the contrary, his mother (Tilda Swinton) can't help but think that somehow everything is her fault, and by and large the community agrees. This is far and away one of the strongest performances I've ever seen Tilda Swinton give, and that's saying a lot, because she has always been terrific. Watching this was almost difficult, as one could actually feel her pain and see in her eyes the emotional toll everything had taken on her. She did nothing wrong, but everyone from the press to the owner of the local grocery store, blames her for the actions of her son. The film flashes between before, during, and after the event to show the differences in the lives and personalities of the characters, in a way that I've never seen before, it was really ingenious. This film delves deeper into the heart of darkness and into the eyes of the unseen victims in one of the most powerful films I've seen in years. We Need To Talk About Kevin may even be too emotionally overwhelming for some, but by in large it is one of the hardest hitting and most realistic dramas you may ever find."" ]"

For that reason, he is usually best paired with someone who is charismatic, but in this film, he's paired with Ryan Reynolds, another intense actor, leading to a very straightforward and inflexible film. Safe House is your typical C.I.A. inspired action film, that features a wanted traitor turning himself in, in order to escape the men he's doubled crossed. The names and places are different, but the story is the same, lots of fighting and corruption, traitors and double agents, it's nothing new. The intensity in Safe House is just off the charts, as there isn't one second of comic relief. The movie starts intense and just continues that way until the end, which really does an injustice to the always strong performance of Washington. The fact of the matter is that this film could have been an interesting one, had Washington and Reynolds had any chemistry whatsoever, but they were basically the same person, on opposite sides of the table. Chemistry in a film like this is really everything, even in a film like Unstoppable, another straight forward and highly predictable film, it was entertaining because of the chemistry between Washington and Chris Pine. All in all, Safe House is an average film, without much of a supporting cast. It's two hours of chases and gun battles, over the same stuff that all these other films are based on. It's a textbook example of an action movie, with nothing else. It is forgettable and isn't unique in anyway, just the same thing you've seen a million times before."" ]"

She is terrified of the man, but he assistant doesn't know any better and wants to make a name for himself by going after the legendary medium. I am in utter disbelief that a film with a cast like this was direct-to-film, but all that aside, it's as good a story as you'll find on the big screen. What can you say about De Niro and Weaver that hasn't been said a million times before, but this film is almost like a passing of the torch, as Murphy got the majority of the air time. How'd he do, Cillian Murphy absolutely stole the show right out from under them, in what is easily his best performance to date. To be honest, this is one of those films I watched for the cast, I wasn't super interested in the story and at times it was painfully slow, but Red Lights has some downright creepy moments, and the ending will absolutely blow your mind. If you're the patient type who enjoys a great performance, this films for you, if not, you might want to skip this one, as it takes a while to get going, and gives you some things you really have to think about afterwards."" ]"
act-of-valor;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Act of Valor is a refreshingly new and ambitious idea, that takes the stories of active U.S. Marines and turns them into one big story, which is then played out by the very Marines who experienced them. I loved the concept, but this film falls way short of expectations. I believe the purpose of military is the service and protection of our nation, but in Act of Valor the Marines are portrayed as trigger happy Americans. We see the Marines, following up on CIA Intel, going into four different foreign countries, shooting first and asking questions later. Is this really the image of our military that we want to portray to the rest of the world? Regardless of what's real and what's not, these Marines come off as ruthless, with an attitude of  you we're American, we'll do what we want.' As expected, the action scenes were some of the best and most realistic I've ever seen. I would except nothing less, being that the film features men who have been in actual combat and know what it looks like. The acting, also as excepted, was really awful, but for the first time in the twenty month history of this blog I won't blame the actors for it, since after all, they aren't really actors. The action sequences alone more than make up for the  acting job, but again, I have a real problem with the message this film is sending out to the world. Chronicling the heroism and every day life of a U.S. Marine is admirable, but portraying them like Bruce Willis in Die Hard isn't doing them any favors, in fact it's making an already difficult job harder."" ]"
lockout;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Luc Besson is the Writer/Director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Usually when you sit down to watch one of his films, you're in for a treat. When he said he was making a new film that combined elements of both popular movies, I was excited, and then sorely disappointed. Lockout introduces us to a new kind of a prison, one that is in outer space, and holds it's prisoners in cryogenic stasis. The daughter of the U.S. President (Maggie Grace) was set to tour the facility, to make sure the prisoners are being treated fairly, when all hell breaks loose. Wanting to restore order with a minimal amount of casualties, the President sends in one man, his best C.I.A. operative, Snow (Guy Pearce), whose job it is to save the hostages. For starters this film is so full of cliques and references to other things that it almost becomes a farce of itself. Guy Pearce is the star and he was very good, however his character plays like John McClain in Outer Space. Snow is full of jokes and is this huge tough guy, who was almost a mirror image of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The only thing missing was a catch phrase and lets all be thankful for that. Pearce is paired with Maggie Grace, who as in Taken, finds herself as a hostage once again. To her credit, she was a lot less whiny than in Taken and even fights back a little bit, but she basically played the same character that she always does. I don't know about you, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for a beautiful spoiled blonde girl who gets into trouble because she traveled to Europe or had to take on the cause of prisoners rights. Overall, there was a lot of action, but not much of a story to play on. Guy Pearce does a pretty good job, but Lockout is honestly a predictable, paper thin story, with special effects that aren't anything to write home about. It's another big budget film that tries to wow audiences with a unique setting and lots of explosions in the previews, but the only surprise here is that the usually reliable Luc Besson fails to deliver a worthwhile film."" ]"
the-hole;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Kids get a bad rap in films. It is assumed because of their age and lack of experience, that they are less talented than adult actors. While in many cases this is true, it is not the rule. Some people I spoke to, immediately had no interest in The Hole, because of it's young cast. Right away they were saying this is going to be a rip off of Goosebumps and didn't even give it a chance. The film may not have been the scariest film I've ever seen, but it had a great backstory, a lot of suspense, and some very talented young actors. Those kids play Dane and Lucas, who are forced to move from the city to the country, to hide from an abusive father. The boys are miserable and decide to explore the old house the family has rented. What they find is a giant hole in the basement, with seemingly no bottom. As they continue to be fascinated by the hole, things in this small town, and especially in this old house just continue to get stranger and stranger, leading to a tremendous ending that will teach the boys, that sometimes the only thing you can do is face your fears. The star of this film is Nathan Gamble, who has done a lot for someone so young. I've seen him in a bunch of things and weather he's playing Commissioner Gordon's son in The Dark Knight, or the young activist in Dolphin's Tale, Gamble just has this way of always pulling at the audiences heart strings. Once again he's this cute, innocent kid, who's been traumatized by years of abuse, yet he still manages to face his fears, unleashed by the hole. I've seen plenty of films where kids in this situation just run away and hide, but that's not his style, and that's part of why this movie isn't a Goosebumps story. The bottom line, I think The Hole will appeal to Science Fiction fans more than Horror fans, despite the fact that it's labelled as Horror. The young cast is refreshingly energetic, curious, and eager, all things that will become contagious, and make the Hole, a much better film than you think it's going to be."" ]"
the-raven;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""165 years ago, Edgar Allen Poe was on his way from Boston to Virgina, preparing for a new job. He never made it and was found on a bench in Baltimore, near death. He was delusional, wearing someone elses cloths, and kept repeating the name Reynolds, before he died. To this day, the cause of death and his reason for being in Baltimore are unknown. On the anniversary of his death, I decided to watch The Raven, which contrary to popular believe is not a remake of an older film. This story is a fictional take on Poe's last days, as the writers have Poe assisting local police in catching a serial killer. A killer is on the loose in Baltimore and using Poe's stories as the inspiration for his crimes, so who else is more qualified to help catch him than Poe? I am not a big fan of period dramas, as most are historically inaccurate and move at a snails pace, but the Raven was different. As fiction, it is of course extremely inaccurate and features Poe has an eccentric has been and a fall down drunk, but surprisingly the film is fast paced and really keeps you on the edge of your seat. The idea of using Poe's stories as the inspiration for a real murderer, who tries to copy his stories to the last detail was really brilliant and it plays very well, especially to fans of his work. John Cusack plays the mysterious writer and by this point in his career, I'm convinced that the man can play anyone and be believable. In thirty years, there isn't a role he wouldn't take on and I'm hard pressed to remember even one instance of him failing to be spectacular. The Raven is a stand alone film, with a common title for films featuring Poe, however this one is a great mystery that incorporates very little modern day thinking into the story. The Raven has everything you'd expect from this type of film, simply set 165 years ago. From police chases on horse back to wild 1800's costume parties, this film really surprised me with just how good it was and most definitely gets labeled as a must see movie!"" ]"

A group of friends are traveling through Europe in what looks like a shot for shot remake of Hostel, when they meet a man who gives tours of the abandon city near Chernobyl. After being rejected entry into the city, the group sneaks in and runs into a whole mess of trouble. This is your very basic zombie film, with nothing extraordinary about it. You've seen this story a hundred times, but what makes Chernobyl Diaries different is that it takes place in Russia and features a talent cast. What's interesting about this cast is that none of them have any background in horror. Jesse McCartney is a singer who does mostly voice over work, and Devin Kelley is almost strictly a TV actress. Taking these role was something new for them and they really put all they had into it. I feel like it was wasted effort though, as this film really is nothing different. Friends on vacation go to a unique location and run into something supernatural that tries to kill them, it's been done over and over again. The unique location made for a great start to something, unfortunately the writers didn't know what to do with that, and the result is another ordinary film that gets an average rating."" ]"
looper;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""You can never go wrong in choosing a movie that stars Bruce Willis or Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but when they come together, that's when the magic really happens! Looper is the brainchild of Rian Johnson, who likes to bring us unusual stories, that mainly star JGL, however Looper is much easier to follow than most of Johnson's other films. While I'm not his biggest fan, his attention to detail has always really stood out to me and is perhaps never more evident than in Looper. Johnson actually used make-up and special effects to make JGL resemble a young Bruce Willis, which I found to be ingenious. Not to be overlooked is of course how clever a story Looper is, as it blends together time travel and the mafia. In the future, time travel has been invented, but like every other good thing, it is illegal. The mafia controls time travel and uses it as a weapon to commit murder. In this future world, it is impossible to dispose of a body, so the mafia sends their targets back in time where they are met an executed by a hired gun, known as a looper. The performances are of course top notch, Willis, the action star of a generation, only gets better with age, and JGL is the simply put the hardest working, most under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. To be completely honest, this intriguing, action-packed, thriller was not as good as I expected it to be, and I really didn't care for the way in ended. That being said, it is still a great film that is definitely worth your while."" ]"
hit-and-run;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Hit & Run is a wild ride that never should have worked, but surprisingly it does. The story doesn't appear to be deep or complicated, and just when you think they've come to the end, a whole other angle begins. The film is further helped by a large cast and a whole bunch of interesting cameos, that help take it to another level. Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) is happy living in a small town with his girlfriend, Annie (Kristen Bell), but things are about to change. When Annie gets offered a job in L.A., Bronson must decide whether or not to go with her, which also means leaving the safety of the witness protection program. When a jealous ex learns of the plan, he finds out who Charlie really is, and thanks to Facebook, connects with the men he's hiding from, making the trip to L.A. a dash for safety, across California. Dax Shepard is not an actor I find to be very funny, but this was the first time I've seen him play a character as deep as Charlie Bronson, and he was terrific. He is being perused by Bradley Cooper of all people, who I did not see as someone who could play the bad guy. His good looks and charming personality, don't exactly lead one to believe he'd be believable as a bad guy, and while he wasn't the toughest bad guy I've ever seen, he does more than an adequate job. Hit & Run isn't an award winning film, it may not even be all that memorable, but it is extremely entertaining and an edge of your seat thriller ride. The perfect film for those who want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show."" ]"

It's a normal day for bike messenger Riley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as he picks up a package and goes on his way. Everything is fine until a strange man tries to run him down and steal the package. From there its a race through NYC to see who gets the mysterious package first. Premium Rush is Gone In 60 Seconds on bicycles. The plot is weak, the story is predictable, and the whole film is basically one big chase through Manhattan. Yes, Premium Rush is exciting at first, but after a half hour, it gets very tiresome, very quickly. JGL tries his hardest to turn this film into something, but even a star of his caliber can't save this film, because there really isn't anything to save. It's as if the producers said, lets have a car chasing a bike in New York City and develop some kind of story around that. It doesn't work, because seldom I have been this bored and frustrated by an action movie. It stars one of my top 10 favorite actors, but there really isn't much of a role for him to play.

It was pretty awesome, sometimes you saw him as Peter, other times Brian, and so on. The real surprise of this film was Mark Wahlberg. I can't remember ever seeing him in a comedy and I wasn't sure his rather dry personality would work with MacFarlane's brand of humor, but he fit in like he's been doing this for years. I mean he was Marky Mark, he must have some personality in there somewhere! As for the story, it's not much different than a really good episode of Family Guy. Of course, it a lot more raunchy and it's not animated, but there are certainly many parallels, and defiantly some hysterical lines.

In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash-cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view."" ]"

There was bullying when I was a kid, but 3 PM meant the end of the trouble. We had the rest of the day, the weekend, and the summer to recover. The advent of social media and cell phones has made the respite obsolete, as now, bullies can torture their victims 24/7. Bully is an award winning documentary that looks at the problems of bullying and shows the effects it has on children's lives. What I like about this film is that it showed a whole group of students from different economic, social, and ethnic backgrounds. What I took away is that anyone who is even slightly different in anyway, could be a target. What I didn't like was the solutions the film offers. Their solution is to tell someone and to stand up for kids you see being bullied, but anyone who has been bullied will tell you that those are not good ideas. Often times telling someone will anger the bully and make it worse, and as for standing up for other kids, often times that makes someone who wasn't previous bullied, a target. I think the answer is two-fold, in that first, parents need to tell their kids, from a very earlier age, that being unique, different, and even weird are admirable qualities in a person. I also believe the schools need to be tougher, because honestly, does anyone really think that giving a bully detention, telling them they're not nice, and that their hurting other kids really does anything? I think bullies need a taste of their own medicine, to feel those powerful emotions for even for just one day. You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you don't really know what something is like until you've experienced it for yourself."" ]"

Recently, Cusack has done a lot more direct-to-video stuff, deciding to be a big fish in a much smaller pond, and it has worked out very well. The Numbers Station is a secret CIA base in a secluded part of England, where encoded messages are sent to agents in the field. Emerson (John Cusack) was one of those agents, until his conscience caught up with him, and he is assigned to guard the station, a quiet, lonely job, until terrorists break in, and he is the last line of defense. A movie like this, with a small cast in a secluded location, only works if the stars of the film can keep you're attention and make the story believable, and both Cusack and Malin Akerman both do a terrific job of it. This movie is more about the intensity of the situation and the reaction of the people involved than it is about killing bad guys, and that is why Cusack was perfect choice for the lead in this film. Few actors bring the experience of intensity that John Cusack brings to a project. The story here, wasn't anything unique or extraordinary, but it was an action film from a more psychological point of few. Most action films are more about big explosions and special effects, the story is secondary, but in The Numbers Station, things are reversed and that's why I liked it so much. It's a fun film, that will keep you guessing, with a cast that will engage you the whole way. It may have been an independent direct-to-video film, but it has the bite of a much larger beast."" ]"
sinister-2012;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Original ideas in horror are hard to come by given the nature of the genre. The fans all want to be scared, some want blood and gore, and do we ever really want to see a happy ending? The idea behind Sinster was simple, lets give fans a little bit of everything and see how they react. Seeking peace and solitude, real crime writer, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), moves his family to the country, unaware that the house he's living in has a checkered past. That is until he finds an old movie projector with 8mm films, that will horrify the man to his core. Having children as the perpetrators of these crimes was my favorite part of the film, I love it when horror movies do that, because what could be scarier than an evil child. You take the most innocent thing in the world, turn it evil, and once that happens what can you do about it? Would you be able to shoot a kid? So how do you stop them? The idea is bone chilling. I also liked the fact that they touch on every aspect of the genre they could from ghosts to possession, from gore to jump scares, they really did include a lot. The problem however is that the film focuses on Ethan Hawke, who tries to shield his family from what's happening, while investigating the events on his own, and this makes the time in between events move at a snails pace. With so much going for it, this is a movie that should have a lot going on, not long periods of nothingness. Personally I'd like to see the story focus on a child and watch as he/she transforms into one of the kids in the 8mm films, that would be cool. For what it's worth, this wasn't a bad film, the cast was pretty good, and they did a lot with what they had, but ultimately Sinister just moved a little too slowly for me."" ]"

Parker is a thief for hire, one of the best money can buy. When an old friend hooks him up with an ambitious crew, Parker is eager to get started on a job, that promises seven figures. The job goes off without a hitch, but on the way back the crew lets Parker know that this was just seed money for a much larger and almost impossible job. When Parker refuses to partake, he winds up left for dead on the side of the road, with only one thing on his mind, revenge. This film puts a new twist on a classic story and it is done to near perfection by a top star and veteran Director, Taylor Hackford (Ray, The Devil's Advocate). Statham makes the story with his best performance to date and has plenty of help to ensure this movie is his crown jewel. The list of Emmy and Academy Award winners is this film is staggering. I won't list them all, as you can see the full cast on IMDB, but when you put that many stars together, the result is almost always going to be magic. In the end the film does turn out to be somewhat predictable, but it's one of those times where you really just don't care. Parker is two hours of excitement with all the comedy, explosions, twists, and turns you could hope for. I can't possibly recommend it enough for fans of the Action genre. In an Action film it's hard to get a good cast and even harder to get a decent story to go with the mayhem, but Parker has that an more.

Felicity herself, Keri Russell, gives an interesting performance with a cold, quiet, intensity that was something to see, but the real star of the movie was young Dakota Goyo. Goyo is best known as the annoying little kid in Reel Steel, but he's grown up quickly, and was simply the most realistic character in the whole film. What makes Dark Skies unique is it's fantastic ending, which was very unexpected, and much more eclectic than one would expect to see in a film like this. Some fans complained that the ending was too reminiscent to that of 1408, and while it was similar, unlike 1408, the ending of Dark Skies wasn't nearly as predictable. The ending comes out of nowhere and as far as I'm concerned, it's the cherry on the sundae. Dark Skies wasn't as technical or scientific as the most of the Sci-Fi I like, but it was still quite entertaining and the ending made a good film that much better."" ]"
a-good-day-to-die-hard;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Die Hard was once a great series that featured a loveable charachter facing down the improbable, with great action, in a compelling story. But, the improbable has become the impossible in it's fifth installment, with over the top special effects, a weak storyline, and some very dry acting. I am an action junkie and Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, but the essence of John McClane died a long time ago. Right from the start I could tell that Willis wasn't all that into this and it shows, as McClan goes from being the ultimate tough guy to a man just going through the motions. The story centers around reuniting with his son in a foreign country, which I though was an interesting twist, but the angle as well as any semblance of a story was barely touched upon. Die Hard 5 was just one over the top action scene after another, with very little substance, emotion, or appeal for audiences. The John McClan we knew and loved, the man who saved the Nakatomi building, is long gone, instead he is replaced by an emotionless man who expects this sort of thing to happen to him wherever he goes. Willis was going through the motions for a big pay day, and while there were some good lines and some great action sequences, there isn't much of a story or cast to write about. Die Hard 5 is about making money through special effects, using characters who have long out lived their usefulness. If this is how the series has evolved than I pray that this will be the end of it. If the producers want to milk more money out of the franchise, maybe they can wait ten years or so and have some British hunk remake it, with Willis making a cameo, until then, I must declare the Die Hard series official dead with A Good Day To Die Hard."" ]"
the-kings-of-summer;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Everyone thinks their parents are crazy, but in the case of Joe, Patrick, & Biaggio, their parents really are nuts. Looking to escape the insanity of their every day lives, the boys decide one summer to build a cabin in the woods, where they can live off the land like men. Nick Robinson stars as Joe, and gives a performance that is out of this world. In a film that stars three kids in the woods, it would be very easy for things to turn stupid very quickly, but as the leader of the pack, Joe not only keeps the group together, but keeps the story together. No matter what this young man does over the course of his career, he will have a hard time duplicating what was easily a career defining performance. Robinson is paired with Disney star Moises Arias, who until now I thought was just this weird little guy they used to guest in their shows. Arias plays Biaggio, easily one of the funniest characters I've seen in a very long time, some of the things that come out of his mouth are just fall on the floor funny. As the kids enjoy their time in the woods, their parents really start to show their crazy, as they go on a hunt for the lost boys. The characters were all unique in their own way, but Joe's father, played by Nick Offerman, was far and away the best, leading the parents the same way, his son lead the boys. From gigantic wontons to turtles on kites, The Kings of Summer is an extremely enjoyable film and the rare instance of a film that I wish was longer. I truly loved every second of this smart coming of age comedy, for it's uniqueness and young exciting cast. Blending dramatic and comedic elements, The Kings of Summer is that perfect mix that takes you from laughter to tears and back again. For that, this film is an easy choice for one of our must see movies!"" ]"
mud;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Mud is a strange coming of age story, where one boy learns that love isn't forever and that friendship comes in many different forms. Critics and fans on the movie sites I go to have been raving about this film, so I had to check it out and chime in. I agree with those who say that newcomer, Tye Sheridan, gives an amazing performance, but as for the rest of the film, I think it leaves something to be desired. While out exploring, two boys meet a strange man named Mud, stranded on an island. This man is full of stories and needs the boys help to reconnect with his girlfriend and leave the island. For starters, the film is full of inconsistencies. Mud is starving and needs these boys to bring him food, but somehow, he always has a cigarette in his mouth. One or two things could be overlooked, but the inconsistencies fill up this film. While it's a good story, there isn't a lot of substance to it and the film moves at a snails pace, another thing that tends to turn viewers away. The best thing to do would have been to use flashbacks in Mud's stories to fill the time, instead there are a lot of symbolic scenes of people lost in thought, the business of the town, the kids hanging out, it was very methodical, but also very dull. Matthew McConaughey plays Mud and does a decent job, the problem doesn't lie with him. The film is based on this guy, and for a character with such an interesting past, he really is a sad, dull guy. The only real positive I took away from this film was Tye Sheridan, who plays one of the boys. He does a tremendous job as he starts to realize that love isn't everlasting. To see how this character matures from the beginning of the film to the end, is really remarkable, but it's not unique. Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen similar stories, where the film is much more interesting and the same thing ends up happening. Mud is ambitious and may be the start of a long career for two young actors, but ultimately it's long, slow, and forgettable."" ]"
warm-bodies;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Love comes into play in almost every feature film you will ever see. It comes in many forms and often times, entire movies are centered on it. Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff. To be honest, I thought it might be good for a few laughs, but I never thought this film would be as good as it was. It has a message and makes an impact, while being a funny, edge of your seat thriller. This was really not something I would usually go for, but my recent Walking Dead inspired zombie craze put it on my radar and it was an amazing ride."" ]"
oz-the-great-and-powerful;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When I first heard that Disney was doing a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, I was kind of annoyed. Then I remembered that they did a pretty decent job making a sequel to it, 25 years earlier. My hopes got even higher when I heard that James Franco would star in it. To me, he was such an interesting choice to play the wizard. Franco is a very versatile actor, but he's known more for action and comedy, not family films, but he brings a very interesting dynamic to the movie. Much like the Wizard of Oz and Return To Oz, this film is taken directly from the original Oz stories of L. Frank Baum. Once again, instead of just adapting a book, the screen writers picked and chose from several stories to create this one, and if I may say so, they did a very good job. Of course there is a bunch of Disneyizing to it, as seen with the spunky china girl and the talking monkey, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Franco is terrific and really carries the story. He combines his charms and looks with goofiness and ingenuity to make his character come alive in a way that L. Frank Baum would have loved. He's paired with Mila Kunis who is also really good and used to playing unlikable characters...Shut up Meg! What I especially liked about this film is how they played off the original. Starting in black & white, in an old box format, before opening up to the tradition high def. widescreen view was ingenious. I also loved how people from the black & white story had roles in Oz, just like the original. What was strange though is that they made Oz out to be a real place and discounted the whole dream aspect of the stories. In all of Baum's writings it was never known for a certainty weather or not Oz was a real place. The fact of the matter is that nothing in this genre will ever be as good as the original Wizard of Oz, but The Great & Powerful answers a lot of questions, is taken directly from the writings of the original author, has a great cast, and really does an impressive job of connecting to a film that was made 75 years earlier."" ]"

The trailers for this film made it look absolutely hysterical, a completely can't miss comedy, but it's extreme raunchiness turns out to be it's worst enemy. When an ambitious FBI agent (Sandra Bullock) is sent to Boston to catch a monster, she sees it as an open and shut case. What she didn't expect was to run into a local detective who is anything but conventional. The background story and case the pair are working on is really terrific and very well written, with just the right amount of comedy, this really could have been the female version of Lethal Weapon. Instead, the Heat goes so far over the top, that by the end it just isn't that funny anymore. Sandra Bullock is terrific, despite playing her usual whiny loner character. When she finally has had enough of McCarthy and snaps, it really is the best part of the whole film. Mellisa McCarthy is the problem here, as she too is playing her usual character, but to a real extreme. I find her to be very funny, but in this film, nothing is serious and every other word out of her mouth is an F bomb. Every time the story really starts to take off and become interesting, she shows up to screw everything up. Don't get me wrong here, this film is much better than some of the other comedies to come out lately, but as it's destine for a sequel, my hope is that they will tune it down a bit. The right line at the right time can really make a film like this and some scenes are hilarious, but the truth is, when the jokes are non-stop and the action is few and far between, it really hurts the film. Lethal Weapon would be the perfect template for a team like this and with the right jokes at the right time, they could find even more success than Glover and Gibson did."" ]"
were-the-millers;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Well, I could have done without seeing the ginger kids uncircumcised penis, aside from that this was a pretty fun movie. Jason Sudeikis is one of these guys who just gets better and better with every film he does. I used to be a hater, but now I'll see anything that he's in, and We're The Millers is his best movie to date. This story is about a local drug dealer who gets in trouble with his supplier, and the only way out is to become a trafficker. Dave Clark (Sudeikis) decides the best way to do this is to recruit a fake family to make it look like they're just on vacation. Clark recruits his neighbor, a stripper, and a local homeless teen to be his fake family complete and the Millers are born. This film is non-stop laughs, as I said earlier Sudeikis was hilarious, but surprisingly so was Jennifer Aniston. There are a lot of knocks against her, especially when it comes to comedy, but whenever Rachel plays a fowl mouthed, raunchy character, I see her in a whole new light, and she was terrific in this film. Will Poulter is another stand out from the film, he's been acting since a very young age, but to my knowledge has never been in a comedy before. Here he plays a loveable geek that would easily fit in with the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Out of all the funny scenes and outrageous moments, it's Poulter's that made me laugh the hardest. Is this the best movie I've ever seen? Not even close, but it's one of those comedies that just keeps coming at you and never stops. While the story is a bit ridiculous, I promise you will still laugh until you're sides hurt, because We're The Millers is the best new comedy I've seen all year."" ]"
paranoia;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""After making a name for himself in the Hunger Games, teen heartthrob, Liam Hemsworth got his first leading role in the corporate thriller, Paranoia. This film has a somewhat complicated plot to explain without spoilers, but I will attempt to do so. Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) is a low level employee at one of the worlds largest tech company. His boss has learned that their main competition, his former employer, is about to unveil a revolutionary piece of new technology, that can change everything. Fearing for his companies future, Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) decides to give Cassidy the opportunity of a lifetime, that is if he's willing to break a few dozen laws or so. Liam Hemsworth was terrific, giving a performance similar to the one Bradly Cooper gives in Limitless, as a guy with an important job that's in way over his head. Hollywood finds these good looking guys and the truth is that a lot of them have nothing to offer, but Hemsworth proves that he has the talent it takes to star on the big screen. In the film he's supported by a real all-star cast, that includes Harrison Ford, Richard Dryfuss, and Gary Oldman, all of whom do what they've been doing for half a century, making great films even better. The only reason this film isn't getting 5 stars, is the same reason it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. Paranoia is about corporate espionage and at times, the business aspect is confusing and makes us feel as overwhelmed as Hemsworth's character does. Other than that, I can't find a thing wrong with this film, it is absolutely one of the best edge of your seat thrillers I've seen all year and easily earns the right to be called one of our must see movies!"" ]"
oblivion;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""When Tron 2 Screenwriter, Joseph Kosinski, started shopping for a Publisher for his graphic novel, Oblivion, they told him it was so good that he should bring it right to the big screen. Before you know it, some big names signed out and the film was released as a big budget blockbuster. There are a ton of cool gadgets in a story about a futuristic world, that has been destroyed by war. What initially turned me on to this film was the trailer, which show you the technology, but tell you almost nothing about the story. The films description is the same way, it tells you very little and really gets your curiosity going. The story starts by telling us what has become of the world, 65 years in the future. The planet has been destroyed by war and the humans have left the planet for one of Saturn's moons. All that's left is a bunch of technology meant to harvest Earth's resources for the people on Titan. The remaining rebels mean to sabotage this technology and it's the job of Jack and Vicka to repair and protect the technology from the last remaining terrorists. Tom Cruise stars and by now we all know how I feel about Tom Cruise. Fortunatly for Mr. Kosinski, this was a film that Cruise was really into and he does give one of his strongest performance since Minority Report. Cruise is terrific and is the main reason this film works in the beginning. With the extensive back story, it takes a while for anything substantive to happen and that's where Cruise and the unique technology come into play. They carry the film from the shocking beginning into the heart of the story. Once this film gets going it is one of the best pure Science Fiction films to come along in years. To his credit, even though the film is weird and starts out slow, Kosinski wouldn't let Hollywood touch it. The result is an old school type of Science Fiction film, done with modern technology. The geeks will love this movie, but there is also enough of a side stories and some amazing special effects that will help gain the majority of audiences. Oblivion was a terrific ride and something you don't see everyday, I really can't recommend it enough."" ]"
the-wait;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The Wait is the type of independent drama that the critics always love and that I usually hate. I decided to watch it though, because of one very special cast member, who is really coming into his own, Devon Gearhart. Even since I saw this young man in the movie Canvas, I knew he was really something special. Gearhart's unique ability to get the viewers to empathize with whatever character he is playing, gives him a strength that very few actors have. I knew from the description that the character of Ben, in The Wait, was a perfect outlet for him to express this ability and he does not disappoint. As for the rest of the film, it is a dark, eclectic film, full of odd symbolism and strange music, that to be honest is a bit over my head, but it's also a film that most audiences can relate to. The family portrayed, whose last name we never know, is pulling together and preparing for the tragic death of their terminally ill mother. The family is preparing themselves for the worst, that could happen any day, when they come in contact with a psychic. The psychic tells them that their mother is special and destine to come back from the grave, leading the family to not only hold off on making any funeral plans, but the prediction leads them to prepare a welcome home party. As I said the storyline is strange, the film is full of strange symbolism, and it moves rather slowly, but the cast here is unbelievable. Aside from Gearhart's out of this world performance, that will leave even the toughest person in tears, both Chloe Sevigny and Jena Malone are fantastic as the two eldest sisters. The sisters, always at odds are trying to pull themselves together for the inevitable, but are once again drawn apart by the psychic's prediction, leading to a dramatic rift in the storyline. The bottom line is, that The Wait, isn't a film for me, but I can see many people really enjoying it. The story is unique, the performances are terrific, and the future of Hollywood may be on display in this relatively unknown masterpiece."" ]"
the-outsider-2014;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Some Writer/Directors prefer to use the same actors in their films. You can't blame them for wanting to work with people they're comfortable with, but not many Writer/Directors, remake the exact same movie with a slightly different twist. Brian A. Miller came out of relative obscurity to produce the hit action thriller, The Prince, starring Bruce Willis. Less than a year later, he followed it up with The Outsider, which is basically the exact same film! The Prince featured a former mafia turncoat, going to the city he once owned, in order to find his missing daughter. The Outsider features a former member of British Special Ops, coming to America, to find his missing daughter. Both films have similar endings, mafia bosses that are played by legendary action stars, and oddly enough, both films have a cameo by 50 cent. These two films are literally so similar to one another, that aside from the British accent, and Jason Patric in the role of the cop, nothing has really changed. As a fan of action film, I realize there aren't many different directions these films can go in, but to release what amounts to the exact same film, a year later, with several of the same actors, is just bizarre. The Outsider wasn't a bad film, and I did enjoy Craig Fairbrass, he was a beast, who I was previously unfamilar with, but aside from that, this is the exact same story as seen in The Prince. Wheather you chose to sit through this one or that one, really depends on who you like better, James Caan or Bruce Willis."" ]"
oldboy-2013;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Ever since the success of the Grudge, 10 years ago, American filmmakers have been looking to popular overseas films for original ideas, many times simply remaking them. To many, this seems like a desperation move for original material, but I see it more as a cultural thing. Movies often reflect the society of the country they were made in, and by remaking them in the United States, the story introduces movie lovers to something unique, from a different culture. I personally find this very desirable and have appreciated many of these remakes, even when I didn't love the story. In his latest venture, Spike Lee takes on the Korean classic, Oldboy. This is a film that was remade simply because of how bizarre and shocking the story is. The year is 1993, and Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) isn't a great guy. For some reason, he's drugged and then locked away in a pretty decent looking room without doors or windows, and held there for exactly 20 years. Then, just as suddenly as he was imprisoned, he was released, and goes on a search for answers, in this seemingly new world. Josh Brolin stars and is usually pretty good as an ancillary character, but as the star of a thriller, I was skeptical. As always, he could have shown some more emotion, but he was much better than I thought he'd be. Spike Lee gives him as much help as he can, by giving him a huge cast of supporting actors, all of whom had name recognition. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson playing a psychopath, was very funny, and definitely injected some much needed humor. Oldboy is one of those films where it all comes down to the ending. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won't say anything other than to tell you, that it is bizarre and twisted, with an ending the likes of which you couldn't possibly have imagined. Even if you start to watch this film and don't really like it, stick with it, because the ending really is that good."" ]"

Much like in his first film, Neill Blomkamp is examining a modern problem with a futuristic story, and once again, he isn't offering any solutions. As with District 9, Blomkamp is showing how an unsolved issue, left to it's own devices, will eventually cause chaos. In 2154, Earth is overpopulated and in ruins. The rich have built a utopian society on the largest space station ever conceived, and as you may have guessed, it's called Elysium. The story focuses on Max, an orphan and ex-con, who has always dreamed of living in paradise on Elysium. His plans to earn his way take a dramatic turn, when he is injured in an accident at work. Max knows he'll never survive on Earth and the only way to save his life is to get some of the advanced medical treatment available on Elysium. The two stories are very different, but the setting could have been exactly the same. The story itself was pretty good, there was a lot more action then in District 9, yet the similarities are unmistakable. Matt Damon stars and played the role he was asked to play. Max had a lot of potential to be an interesting character, perhaps one with an agenda, instead he was written as this dumb guy, who was anything but a savior to the people of Earth. Max was out to save himself and did what was necessary to survive, but he should have been more. The people all turned to Max to help solve a greater problem, but all he cared about was himself. Jodie Foster also stars, but has a surprisingly small role, that definitely did not fit her personality. Much like District 9 before it, the story of Elysium is used as a forum for the Writers agenda. The two stories are very different, but the technology, locations, and even several cast members are the same. The result is a slightly better movie than District 9, that will give you an eerie feeling of deja vu throughout."" ]"
thor-the-dark-world;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""It's no secret that I've always hated superhero movies. I find them to be cliche, over the top, and so far from reality, that often time the stories are just the lowest form of Science Fiction. The only movies of the superhero genre that I've ever truly enjoyed are the recent Batman trilogy and some of the recent Marvel films. That being said, I hated the first Thor film, because it came directly from a comic book and lacked any kind of background story whatsoever. Thanks in part to the Avengers and the development of the Loki character, that all changes with the second film. The story isn't directly from a comic book, but rather based on one. In this film, the characters are more established and there is a lengthy background story that only enhances the film, and the series. In the second film, Thor is tasked with stopping a deadly weapon, possessed by an all but extinct species. This weapon has the power to destroy the entire universe and as always, the focal point is on Earth. Unable to stop the weapon and save his girlfriend at the same time, Thor turns to an unlikely source for help, his now imprisoned brother, Loki. Given the magnitude of the story and the power of the enemy, I'm a bit surprised that they didn't keep this film to be used as an Avengers sequel, as it has all the makings of an epic sequel. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and this time he is beyond terrific. His role in the Avengers really enhanced the popularity of a character that most people were unfamiliar with, and the tremendous start to the film really set the framework for Hemsworth to take Thor to the next level. Even the supporting cast steps it up a notch as Natalie Portman is more used to the idea of a boyfriend from another world and being involved in things she couldn't possibly understand. Finally, Tom Hiddleston tops of the story, with his portrayal of Loki. I may be going out on a limb here, but I thought Hiddleston was even better in The Dark World than he was in The Avengers. Going into the Avengers, next to The Hulk, Thor was the weakest of the introduction films, and the least known and appreciated character. That all changed with the Avengers and in his second film, the Thor character steps up to a level that rivals even Iron Man. If you're not that into the series and have only selectively seen a few of the films, make sure you include the Dark World, as it is essential to fully understanding Thor and his impact in the future of the series."" ]"
the-hunger-games-catching-fire;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Fans of the Hunger Games were dissapointed with the first movie and rightfully so. The film was pretty good, but didn't do the book justice, as it was extremely toned down and nowhere near as in depth as the book was. With a new director for the second book, they did not make the same mistake twice. As someone who has read all the books, I can tell you that Catching Fire is page for page exactly like the book. It was so amazing how much of the book is captured on the screen, as I actually saw the scenes play out the exact same way they did in my head when I first read Catching Fire. Everything down to the last detail is perfect! Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson return and are both fantastic, so good in fact, that I really wonder if Suzanne Collins had them in mind when she wrote this series. The casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, and the direction is perfect. For those of you who never read the series and didn't really see what was so special about the first film, I really suggest that you give this film a chance. I won't give anything away, but this isn't what you expect, especially the ending, and while there are two more films remaining, this will be your last look inside the arena. After Catching Fire, the series turns into something completely different and that's what I love about it. It would have been simple to have three books about the games, but the games are actually a small part of the second film, and won't take place in the next two films. Rarely do I give a film 5 stars, but the second Hunger Games film is done so much better than the first. They don't hold anything back in this one, and you are introduced to a whole other set of unique characters, that you will be seeing in the other films. The cast is brilliant and new Director, Francis Lawrence, manages to capture essence of the book and bring it to life on the big screen, with unbelievable detail. If you didn't read the books and just don't understand what's so great about this series, go see this movie."" ]"

It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird  I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation."" ]"
iron-man-3;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I know, I'm a bit behind on my Marvel films, but to be honest, after Iron Man 2, I really wasn't looking forward to seeing another one. There's no doubt that Marvel films have gone from simple stories about superheroes to epic adventures with the best writers and actors in Hollywood, but the fact is Iron Man 2 was your typical disappointing sequel. In the third installment of the Iron Man adventure though, the franchise bounces back in a huge way, as we get a story that not only rivals the original, but in my opinion knocks it on it's ass! Iron Man 3 finally answers the question does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces his toughest enemy yet, the one with the greatest reach, that no one sees coming. With his team and gear in ruins, Stark is left to lamb it in the middle of nowhere, and in a sense start over and find himself all over again. After playing Tony Stark for so long and appearing in just about every film Marvel has made in the last decade, Robert Downey Jr. knows everything there is to know about the character, and it has never been more apparently than it is here. Writers utilize cannon from various comics, graphic novels, previous movies, and really delve deeply into the character like never before. I also like the fact that it wasn't just another film with Stark in his lab full of toys. This time he's stranded in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by new people, having to start from scratch, it gave the whole thing a much more realistic feel to it, and finally there's the villain. While I loved every second of the Avengers, the truth is that the bad guys are aliens and aren't all that realistic. The Mandarin is a really bad guy and he's as real as the rest of us, needless to say I loved it. If you're not the huge fan I am and you only decide to see one of the Iron Man films, I'd choose this one. Rarely do I ever suggest seeing anything but the original, where it all started, but in this case, the effects are better, Downey's knowledge of the character is better, the writing is much better, and it's not the same old tagline you tend to get with introductory films."" ]"
hellion;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Coming of age films are a dime a dozen, and what it really comes down to is the stregth of the young actor or actress. The way it usually works out is that the better they are, the better the film is, and when it comes to Hellion, casting was dead on, but there was also something else that made this one special. After losing his mother, Jacob Wilson (Josh Wiggins) started acting out. Maybe his fathers transformation into a full blown alcoholic had something to do with it, or maybe it's the fact that he's left to be the adult and take care of his little brother that's the problem, but whatever the case it gets a whole lot worse. After stupid teenaged behavior causes his younger brother to be taken away and placed with his aunt, Jacob has to become the adult and convince his father to clean up in order to bring his little brother home, a herculean task, when you consider the fact that Jacob himself is still a wreck. The young star of the film, newcomer Josh Wiggins is absolutely terrific, outshining multiple award winning actors and actresses in this film, but he's not the only difference here. Hellion takes on the dark southern poverty stricken surreal feeling of other similar films that have become extremely popular in recent years. Similar to Winter's Bone, Joe, and Mud, there is an aspect to this film that is methodical and real. It's almost like you aren't watching a movie, you're just seeing real life unfold in front of your eyes. This combined with an extraordinary young talent made this extremely enjoyable to watch. Everything was very raw, emotional, and just real, a credit to both the writer, director, and cast involved in Hellion. This style is fairly new in cinema and has really defined the 2010s era, to see it combined with something that was so relate-able made for a very special film."" ]"
the-dark-knight-rises;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Most of the regular readers of this blog will know that I loath superheros, except for Batman. I've always felt there was so much more then meets the eye when it came to that character, but even I didn't see Batman's full potential until Christopher Nolan took the reigns. In all 3 of his Batman films, Nolan made the Dark Knight as realistic as possible, with characters we can relate to, real situations, and real dialogue, that's free of all the ridiculous puns it's predecessors loved so much. The third installment takes places eight years after the events of the Dark Knight, when Gotham has been safe, and the Batman wasn't needed. That is until the powerful Bane shows up. Unlike the first two, this script does not follow the original comic story and skews off in several different ways. Unless you're a longtime fan of the series, you won't realize it, but for us fans, there are some very unexpected developments, which I assume were thrown in to throw off even the most die-hard fans. As for the film, it was amazing in every way possible and was everything I expect from Christopher Nolan, but still, it lacked something and that something was an extraordinary villain. We were all spoiled in The Dark Knight with one of the best performances of all time, and while this film is remarkable, it's lacking a stand out performance from one of it's stars. I can find very little fault with this film other than the fact that no one character really stood out and made themselves as memorable as Heath Ledger did in the Dark Knight."" ]"
divergent;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""When I first heard about Divergent, I though the first Hunger Games rip off was upon us, and besides that the whole story seemed somewhat confusing. It is Science Fiction and Directed by Neil Berger, the mind behind Limitless, so I decided to give it a shot, and it was the best idea I had in a long time."", ""In a post war America, the city of Chicago is fenced off from the rest of the world, and has split into five factions of people. At the age of 18, all citizens must take an aptitude test, to determine where they belong. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) is one of the girls taking the test as the movie starts, and her results show that she has an aptitude for all five factions, making her Divergent. Divergent's are highly intelligent, rebellious, and seen as a threat to the Government, so she hides her results and joins Dauntless, the equivalent of the National Guard in Chicago. During her rough training, the now renamed Trice, meets up with Four (Theo James) who she has an instant connection to, but who is also a threat to her secret identity. One thing that was never explained is why these people have to take the aptitude test, if they are allowed to join whichever faction they choose. It's a major plot hole and the only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars, as I really hate plot holes. Shailene Woodley stars as Trice, making the jump from TV to film, and she has done it with a bang. In much the same way Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect choice to play Katniss, Woodley was perfect for the role of Trice, and brought so much more to the film than I ever thought she would. Theo James is also terrific as Four, the mysterious trainer and love interest of Trice, and together the team is the perfect pair. Divergent is highly original, really well written, and introduced Hollywood to a whole slew of new stars, not to mention it's Director, Neil Burger, is on one hell of a successful run of films. Divergent has everything I look for in a film and in my favorite genre, and for that it is now one of our must see movies!"" ]"
when-the-game-stands-tall;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The one thing you can always count on when watching a football film, is that it's going to be exciting. It doesn't matter if it's a true story, like When The Game Stands Tall, or a made up one like Friday Night Lights. It doesn't matter if the team has won 100 straight games or lost 100 straight games. Every film about football is going to be exciting, so what makes one better than the other? The personalities involved, it all comes down to who the film is focused on and this film has it's eyes on the prize. Jim Caviezel stars as Bobby Ladouceur, one of the most successful high school football coaches of all-time. Ladouceur became a national celebrity, not only because of a big winning streak, but also because of the way he incorporated family values and religion into his coaching, trying to make his player more well-rounded individuals. Caviezel was outstanding, as he is in everything, but after watching six seasons of Person of Interest, it's almost disappointing seeing Caviezel in a role where he doesn't kill anyone. The other focus of the film is Alexander Ludwig, who portrays Chris Ryan, a kid who has all the talent in the world, but has to decide, if he's pushing himself toward greatness for himself or because of a psychotic father. Ludwig always gets second billing, but as with the Hunger Games, nothing would be as good without him. He is the unsung hero of this film as he rounds out the emotional roller-coaster. When The Game Stands Tall has action, emotion, conflict, religion, family, love, hate, a little bit of everything and believe it or not, at the heart of it all is a simple, stupid little game called football. This film was great, it reminded me a lot of the TV version of Friday Night Lights and it's an absolute can't miss for sports enthusiasts."" ]"
into-the-storm;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Many people say that Into The Storm was too much like Twister, but that is only partially correct. Twister was the story of storm chasers, trying to beat another team to the punch in getting data from inside a tornado. Into The Storm also has storm chasers, but they're only a part of the story, as it also features the town caught in a super storm, and a family caught in the middle. If you want to compare this film to twister, simply because of tornadoes and storm chasers you can, but Into The Storm still wins, as it features a better background story, better special effects, and is overall much more intense. Richard Armitage stars as the High School's assistant principle, that goes into the storm to find his missing son, and save other people in the path. While the British Actor isn't known for anything more than The Hobbit, he showed real intensity and fortitude, making the film so much more exciting. He's paired with storm chaser turned rescuer, Sarah Wayne Callies, best known for her roles in Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Callies usual plays the strong female character with great ideas, the leaders right hand if you will. In this film however she is little more than a follower, leading to a performance that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. When you have a film with the popularity of Twister, anything else that features anything even remotely similar is going to be compared to that film and ultimately called a rip off, and parts of it could be considered that. When watching the film and now reflecting on it, I prefer to think of it as updating a great idea with a new cast, story, and effects. You are free to disagree and if you're one of those people who think of it as just another rip off, I'd still recommend seeing it for the special effects, if nothing else."" ]"
the-maze-runner;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The Maze Runner series really appealed to me and long before it was a movie, I read all four books. I was hoping that like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner would be a page for page telling of the story, but it wasn't and in fact several important elements crucial to the sequels were left out. The story begins with a boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in an elevator, surrounded by dozens of other boys. Thomas has no memory other than his name and quickly learns that none of the other boys do either. They are all trapped in the middle of a maze with no idea why or how to escape. This film was done well, but compared to the book, it is like a seventh graders book report. All the players are the same and the events are relatively the same, but all those little things that made this series so special and unique were left out. The film is just a simple story with some terrific special effects, but the book was really extraordinary and non-readers will never have any idea of just how good this movie could have been. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars and really was the perfect choice to play Thomas. Unlike some of the other casting choices, O'Brien really seems to jump right from the pages to the screen in a defining role that almost seemed made for him. Thomas was the same in the movie as he was in the book, but he was the only one. It's very hard to be objective about this, because if I hadn't read the book, I still would have enjoyed the film, but realizing just how much of the story is missing really bothers me and skewed my review of the film. The story is unique, the special effects are great, and their some very good young actors here, I still highly recommend The Maze Runner, but if you are a reader and you enjoy Science Fiction, by all means read the book first."" ]"
felony;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""After the biggest drug bust of his career, veteran Detective, Malcolm Toohey (Joel Edgerton), enjoys a few drinks with friends before driving home. On the way, he barely clips a paperboy on his bike, but what should be a minor incident, becomes big trouble when the boy is badly hurt in the fall. Toohey calls the police, telling his fellow Detective, Carl Summer (Tom Wilkinson), that he was driving home and found the boy laying there. Summer believes him and lets Toohey on his way, but his young partner, Jim Melic (Jai Courtney), doesn't believe the story and despite his bosses orders, refuses to let it go. The story here is pretty solid, the investigation and police work that go into it are very interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie isn't focused on that, as its mostly about Malcolm Toohey and his conscience. We watch as the man turns into a shell of his former self, as he struggles with what to do next. This should be an interesting sub-plot, but not the whole premises of the movie, as it slows things down tremendously. This film moves at such a snails pace, that the terrific and unexpected ending, become almost farcical. Joel Egerton is really terrific in his role, showing how one split second can change a persons life forever. The whole cast was really good and it's a shame that such talent was wasted. It's not that Felony is bad, it's just slow, and lacks the action a police drama should have. That being said, if you're into watching people battle their inner demons and fight their conscience, you might enjoy this film, but to me, it was somewhat boring."" ]"
alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""When something fresh and successful comes along, everyone wants a piece of it. Shortly following the films release, a number of copycats emerge and to be honest most of them are terrible. Maybe it's because we tend to compare it to the original or maybe it's because the scripts are rushed and just aren't that good. In any case, after the release of the Wimpy Kid series, we saw a lot of these family comedies, centering on the not so popular kids, and as expected, most of them were awful, with one notable exception. Alexander's bad day focuses on a young man whose birthday coincides with his first day of middle school, which doesn't go so well. After receiving no sympathy from his family, Alexander wishes that they all had their own bad day, and the results were hilarious. This isn't the typical PG family comedy you see from Disney, as it was quite raunchy for them and really pushes the boundary of that PG rating. Ed Oxenbould stars as Alexander and fits the role like a glove. Oxenbould looks and sounds kind of awkward, after all it is a strange age, but watching him gave the feeling that he's not all that unfamiliar with being unpopular. Possibly playing on real life experience, he rivals Alex Gordon with a performance that was not only believable, but it was also very funny. Another advantage this film has over the Wimpy Kid series is that the young cast has help from some of Hollywood's elite, as co-stars include Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner. The pair give a lot of support and the producers use them to break-up the middle school monotony that would has surely ensued. While not my usual genre, I loved the Wimpy kid series, but Alexander's bad day is more than an adequate alternative for those who are looking for something a little bit different."" ]"
captain-america-the-winter-soldier;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""What can you say about Marvel films that hasn't been said already? When Marvel started making movies, with the exception of Batman, I hated superheroes, I hated everything about them. I had written them off as the lowest, cheapest form of  science fiction, and the first few Marvel films did little to prove me wrong, but then they started getting better, and arguably the best films in the franchise, or at least my favorites have been the Captain America films. Chris Evans is just terrific, he has this innocent naiveté about him surrounded in a childlike wonderment, but when the time comes, he can still kick some ass and even crack a joke, Evans just fits the role like a glove. There's not much point summarizing the story, because if you're not into the whole Marvel scene, you're probably not going to understand or see this film anyway, and that's a shame, because from a visual stand point alone, The Winter Soldier rivals anything Marvel has put out to date. On that note, the one draw back to this film is there is a lot of Avenger story line involved. This is supposed to be a stand alone film, fans of the series loved it and rightfully so, but what about the people who just like the character and aren't into the whole genre? All the other Avenger/Shield/Hydra stuff and other characters from other series could make the story for them more than somewhat confusing. In watching this film, you almost have to have some kind of background knowledge of the characters involvement in other films in order to be in the know and that doesn't sit right with people, particularly kids, who just want to see Captain America. For the fans, however it doesn't get much better than this, it's slightly longer and rougher around the edges than The First Avenger, but it is still a great film, and a must see for anyone is trying to keep with the Marvel franchise."" ]"
nightcrawler;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""There was a huge buzz on the internet about this film, because of Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film. Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did."" ]"
white-rabbit;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Coming of Age films are among my favorite types of movies, but if you're a fan of the genre, you know there are often a lot of strange stories out there, perhaps none stranger than White Rabbit. This film follows Harlon Mckay (Nick Krause), who is a very strange kid, one that is often bullied. Harlon is very easily influenced by other people, as is evident by the scenes with his co-stars. When he's with his best friend, whose immature, they do kid things, and when he meets a bad girl, who doesn't stay in on place very long, Harlon gets into some trouble himself. There's no doubt that Harlon is strange, but so are the circumstances surrounding him. Newcomer Nick Krause plays the troubled lead and he really was terrific. In ninety minutes, this kid must of changed personalities a dozen times, and all of them were tremendous. White Rabbit is very weird, a little creepy, and nothing special until a shocking ending changes everything. Sometimes how you see a film can be changed by an ending that just blows the mind and answers a million questions at once. That is what happens here, and that is the only reason I recommend watching this film. As I've been saying, it's really strange and some parts are hard to sit through, but in the end, you'll be left thinking about what you just saw and wondering about each and every scene. Honestly, it's the kind of film you really need to see more than once if you're hoping to catch everything."" ]"
tracers;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Taylor Lautner may always be remembered as Jacob, the annoying werewolf boy from the Twilight Series. People have a hard time seeing him as anything else, but Tracers is the second action film I've seen him star in, and this kid has the perfect make up to be a huge action star. Lautner is more than just another good looking actor, as he can speak several languages, is a martial arts expert, and an avid parkourer, all skills he uses in his latest film, Tracers. Lautner plays Cam, a down on his luck bike messenger, who comes to befriend a group of parkour enthusiasts. What they do fascinates Cam and he wants to join them, but when he does, he realizes that they aren't just clowning around, they use their skills to commit crime, and once he's in, Cam has no way out. Original action films are hard to come by, as most people are satisfied with all the special effects and dead bodies. It's a genre that really doesn't call for originality, that's why when you come across a film like this, it's a breath of fresh air. The stunts and moves you see in this film are nothing short of magic, and it's star Taylor Lautner did them all himself. We are so used to seeing Lautner as the sensitive love interest in some romanticized film, that it's hard to even imagine him as an action star, but that changes 10 minutes into this film. It's the stunts, the attitude, his characters whole personality, that makes his a unique a-typical action star, and it is really something to see. On the surface, Tracers may be nothing more than another story about a group of burglars, but what they can do is extraordinary, and was really fun to watch. This film is original, fast paced, and brings to light a new action star, who isn't in his sixties or the WWE. It may not have all the bodies and explosions normally associated with this type of film, but as I said, It was a lot of fun to watch."" ]"

Most writer/directors don't hit a homerun their first time out, but in this case, with the help of a young up and coming cast, that's exactly what Bradley King did. This film is very engaging and has you on the edge of your seat, combined with an utterly shocking ending, this is the kind of film that you will still be thinking about days later. It's amazing to me that something of this quality was never released in theaters, but it is just as good, if not better than any thing you'll see on the big screen. The one drawback is that it does take a little while to get moving, hence the bad reviews from people who can't give a film more than twenty minutes, but once it gets started, Time Lapse quickly grabs hold and never lets go. It is refreshingly original and has a young cast that is every bit as intense as the film itself."" ]"
batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Marvel's Avengers was written in such a way, that if you'd never read a comic or seen any of the lead in films, you could still follow what was happening, DC was not so forthcoming with Dawn of Justice. Batman v. Superman is a relaunch of the Batman series, taking place long after the events of The Dark Knight Rises, and it's a direct sequel to Superman: Man of Steel. It would be impossible to give an adequate plot description without spoilers, so let me just start by saying this. The beginning of this film, switches back and fourth between Gotham and Metropolis, shoveling in as much backstory as they possibly can on the two characters in an hour. It is this confusing mix of flashbacks, dreams, and current events, that just leaves your head spinning, after that the movie gets pretty enjoyable until the inevitable fight scene, which was just entirely too long, and shoots off in a direction you wouldn't expect it to. If you're not familiar with the characters from previous films and comics, I assure you that you will have no idea what's happening for most of this film. For those who are more familiar, you'll understand what's happening, but will you care? The way they bring these two franchises together is just an utter mess and the cast from Gotham, in particular, don't make things go smoothly. The cast of Superman has worked together before and Henry Cavill was fantastic, his counterpart however, Ben Affleck, was just as horrible as was expected. I've said it before and I'll say it again, he is a terrific Director, but a complete joke as an actor. Batman is a very difficult role for anyone to play, because it requires two personalities, Affleck barely has one, and I was just awestruck by how someone with his reputation actually may have been a worse Batman than Val Kilmer. On the flip side, Jesse Eisenberg, portraying Lex Luthor, was a revelation! Similar to how people felt when Heath Ledger was cast as the Joker, people laughed at Eisenberg's inclusion, but I found him to be the best part of the whole film. The bottom line here, DC saw how much money Marvel was raking in with the Avengers and wanted to jump on the bandwagon. They didn't want to go the same route as the Avengers did, but their way was far too confusing for the general audience, and only somewhat interesting to the fans of both series. In the end, I think the second film will clear up the mistakes of the first and will be much more enjoyable, but as far as this one goes, I could take it or leave it."" ]"

The allure of this film is the terrific characters created by Luc Besson. The mysterious driver with OCD is back, but is well into his retirement. Instead of helping the bad guys get away, Frank Martin (Statham) is driving rich people around, but he's forced into action when their young son is kidnapped. The story here is somewhat simplistic, but the bad guys are as creative as you will ever see in this type of film. I'm not sure where they found Alessandro Gassman and Amber Valletta, but they were so much fun to watch. He is a self-obsessed drug lord, with ridiculous moves, and big plans, while she is a deadly assassin, whose ability with a gun would put John Wayne and Clint Eastwood to shame. When Statham is added to the mix, you have the perfect formula for one intense movie. Transporter 2 was terrific in that it never stops moving and you will see things you never thought were possible outside of CGI, it was unbelievably entertaining. From the stand point of a film aficionado, while these amazing moves and characters make for a lot of fun, the story and dialogue are severely lacking. This film is not for people looking for a great story or loveable characters, it's made for adrenaline junkies who want to see explosions, long fight scenes, and intense thematic action. If you're all about the action, you won't find much better than this, but if you want there to be some greater purpose, a worth-while cause to fight for, or want to see the world become a better place because of all that happened, you'll be disappointed."" ]"

Quill is a thief, nothing more, nothing less. He is hired to steal something and does it the same way he's done hundreds of times before, only this time, there are a bunch of other people trying to take it from him.

Together with the other renegades, Quill decides the best thing to do is to stop these men and make sure the item is never able to be taken again. Chris Pratt stars and gives the performance of a lifetime. I remember first seeing Pratt in the show Everwood, and thinking that this guy has no personality, amazing how things have changed. Finally able to be himself, Pratt shows that his personality is larger than life itself, and twice now in his young career, he has turned that gift into two of the best characters I've seen in years. Paired with some of Hollywood's brightest young stars, an incredible team of writers, and special effects that are out of this world, Guardians of The Galaxy had all the tools it needed to become the companies biggest earner. This is a film that a lot of people are never going to think of as anything more than a comic book turned into a film for children, but it is so much more than that. From the music to the storyline, to the stars themselves, this film has something for everyone, it was my top film pick of 2014, a must see movie, and something that any true fan of cinema shouldn't miss."" ]"

People thought he was crazy, but the vulgar bear quickly gained a cult following and was a rousing success. The first film was really nothing more than an introduction to Ted, that showed just how extreme a talking teddy bear could be, but it lacked a real story line, and the jokes quickly got old. That however is not the case with the sequel. In Ted 2, the newlywed bear is not getting along with his wife. To save the marriage, they do what many couple do, and decide to have a baby. After failing to obtain \""celebrity\"" sperm, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt, but the state has other ideas, as they determine, Ted can't adopted because he's not a person, he is property. From their Ted has to use every means at his disposal to prove he's a real person. This sequel has an interesting story and Seth MacFarlane finally decided to play on his strengths in regards to a film. Instead of these long drawn out jokes that seven people in the world get, he utilizes cutaways, the same way he does on Family Guy, and it really makes a difference. Half way through the first Ted, I was bored of it already, but Ted 2 is genuinely funny and can hold your interest throughout. This is the kind of film I always expected to see from Seth MacFarlane, and even people who hated the first film, will not be disappointed. Ted is certainly a unique character, but when he's portrayed in the proper setting, he becomes exactly what he was originally intended to be, hilarious!"" ]"

It's not that Age of Ultron was a bad film, in fact there were many parts of it that were very impressive, but what bothered people was how Age of Ultron wasn't geared toward general audiences. In the first film, even if you'd never seen a Marvel film, you could follow the story and enjoy it, but that's not the case with the sequel. Age of Ultron is aimed more at the comic-con crowd and parts of it were very confusing to those of us who aren't familiar with the comics that the film is based on. There are a lot of new characters and new technologies introduced in this film, without any kind of background information given, and as the film progresses, it did become confusing. The story begins with the Avengers as a separate faction from Shield, centering on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) working to develop a new type of artificial intelligence. The pair believe that if they can create this intelligence, everyone can retire and won't have to fight anymore. As always there is a problem though, as the A.I., known as Ultron, comes to life and fails to see the distinction between saving humanity and destroying the planet for the protection of humanity. The film then becomes a race for the clock as the mighty Avengers try to stop Ultron from destroying the planet. We all know that sequels aren't as good as the original, because the creators change things too much and Age of Ultron is no exception. The story isn't even close to as strong as the first film, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. The special effects are even better and the chemistry between the large cast is much more important then it had been previously. These things set the foundation for a better film, but the story fails to deliver. The Avengers is a monumental undertaking for cinema, with so many well known actors and characters trying to come together as one. The idea is ingenious and the technology behind the whole thing is nothing short of magic, but as far as films go, while I loved the first one, I could have done without Age of Ultron."" ]"
love-the-coopers;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Over the past decade, we've seen a recent phenomenon in film, where producers cast many big names in a clip film, that all comes together in the end. While this may work well with superheroes, it has yet to be successful in regards to comedy. That is why the film, Love The Coopers can be defined with one saying, too many cooks in the kitchen. This film features a large and impressive cast, and the previews looked terrific, but I assure you, Ed Helm's little girl calling him a dick, is just about the only truly funny moment in this film. The story here has a lot of different angles, and they do come together quite nicely, but this film is not what it was intended to be, as the last thing I would refer to it as is a hilarious holiday film. A lot of people are going to see this film because of it's cast, and from young Timothee Chalamet to veteran Alan Arkin, this cast is remarkable, however the story is not, in fact this whole film was fairly dull. I expect a lot from the cast, but even Hollywood's best and brightest can't make a film work when the writing just isn't there. I love the concept and I really wanted to like this film, but in the end it's just a big disappointment."" ]"
maze-runner-the-scorch-trials;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The Maze Runner trilogy was one of the best book series I've read since the Hunger Games, but unlike the Hunger games, the transition to the big screen has not been an easy one. The first film in the series, was nothing like the book, as it completely failed to demonstrate the comradery among the boys, as well as eliminating key elements from the story. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who noticed this, as The Scorch Trials made sure the same mistakes didn't happen twice. Of course the same elements that were ignored in the first film had to still be excluded for the sake of continuity, but the rest of the film was dead on. In the second film, the boys learn that their rescue was only short lived, as they are still under the control of Wicked, and are about to face their second test. The group is to be dropped into the most unforgiving part of the earth, a place where the disease runs rampant, and cranks are everywhere, the Scorch. If they can survive the Scorch, the boys will have a better idea of what they are up against, and Wicked may just be able to get what they need from them to finally find a cure, that is if they make it to the end. Unlike the first film, Dylan O'Brian finally embraces the leadership role that Thomas is supposed to play in the series, and gives the film the hero to root for that it was sorely lacking. The additions of Jacob Lofland and Rosa Salazar further move the story along, as the film starts to pursue the side angles much in a way the novels did, something the first film also ignored. The narrow focus of the first film, combined with it's rushed nature, and missing elements, made it seem like a cliff notes version of otherwise terrific novel. The sequel however takes the time to properly tell the story, explore the angles, and was much closer to the original story. If you're not a reader and you were turned off by the first film, I don't blame you, but give the sequel a chance, it's a much more accurate depiction of the story."" ]"
mission-impossible---rogue-nation;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Believe it or not, until now I have never seen a Mission Impossible film. While I love action films, the premise just never appealed to me, but when I heard Christopher McQuarrie would be Directing this latest one, I had to see it. McQuarrie, the brains behind Persons Unknown, always tells imaginative stories, that while aren't that believable, are still extremely entertaining. In the fifth installment of Mission Impossible, the franchise is anything but stale as it is every bit as fast paced and extreme as I thought. I was expecting the action and for Tom Cruise to play his usually arrogant self, but what I wasn't expect was just how intense and in depth the story was. There is also the villain to consider, who was so much better than I hoped he'd be. I had always thought of Mission Impossible as sort of a mix between Get Smart and James Bond, and was presently surprised to learn that I was way off base. Rogue Nation is actually a very clever story, that isn't is as comical or as over the top with espionage as I thought it would be. In fact, the only thing that really was what I expected was Tom Cruise. While he's not my favorite actor, he's not a bad one either, I just never liked the fact that every character he plays is just so full of themselves. No matter the situation, Ethan Hunt was always so sure he had all the answers and knew exactly what to do, and even when he was wrong it didn't deter him from getting right back into it. Rogue Nation taught me a lesson I never seem to get, in that you really can't judge a book by it's cover. Certain stories may appear to be one thing, but you can never know for sure unless you sit down and watch them."" ]"
ant-man;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""As the Marvel franchise has grown to epic proportions with it's unique and compelling take on superhero movies, some of the lesser known characters are starting to emerge and gain popularity, with Ant-Man possibly being the most unique of them all. I don't know how the story in the comic was, but I can tell you this, Ant-Man is the perfect character for the big screen. The special effects are nothing short of magic and take the concepts of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids to a whole other level. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) created a new technology, one that was so dangerous, he buried the research deep in his company archives, but when his successor comes across it years later, he develops it, despite warning from Pym. In order to stop this from getting out, Pym recruits an unlikely hero to help him, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Lang is one of the best burglars around and Pym hopes to use these unique skills to get back his work. The only thing is the company's lab is impenetrable to all, except bugs. Using his prototype, Lang becomes Ant-Man and that is when this film really gets fun. Paul Rudd is absolutely terrific in this movie, as a small, nerdy, awkward guy, he can be hysterical under the right circumstances and this was just the perfect role for his personality. Rudd is paired with Michael Douglas, who 10 years ago wouldn't have even considered doing a film like this, showing just how powerful and influential the Marvel brand has become. Out of all the Marvel films to date this is perhaps the most interesting one. The cast is amazing, the special effects are outstanding, and I may never see Thomas The Train in the same way again. If you're like me, and not crazy about superheroes, don't let that stop you from seeing this film. Ant-Man has a little bit of everything and goes way beyond anything I would have ever expected to see in film based on a comic book."" ]"
jurassic-world;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""It's setting records at the box office and is the most talked about film in years, Jurassic World, the thrilling true sequel to Jurassic Park. I loved Jurassic Park and felt that both sequels didn't do justice to the original, so when they announced that this film would go on the premise that the two sequels never happened, I was extremely excited. Like everyone else, I rushed to the theaters to see, the exact same film I saw twenty years earlier. The tech is better, the effects are better, but the story is almost identical, to the point where each character has an equivalent in the original film. In Jurassic Park, the T-Rex escapes while the kids are in a car, touring the park. In Jurassic World, the Adominus-Rex escapes while the kids are in a sphere, touring the park. This is just one example of literally dozens of parallels to the original film. The only real difference is Chris Pratt, as he is a hell of a lot more believable than Sam Neill was, and his infectious personality makes him the type of guy that everyone wants to be friends with. From his simple start on the WB's Everwood to becoming a Guardian of The Galaxy, Chris Pratt has established himself as one of Hollywood's brightest future stars, but aside from his performance, this is the same film! The Jurassic franchise has the benefit of being created by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. It is produced by perhaps the greatest Director of all time, and once again it introduces moviegoers to some amazing new special effects, but none of it matters when the story just isn't there. With this film people were hoping for something new and exciting from the franchise, a turn in a whole other direction, instead they got a film that is little more than a remake of the original, and a disappointing one at that."" ]"
criminal-2016;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Twenty years ago, a similar film called Face Off debuted, and while the story seemed ridiculous, somehow it worked. Criminal is in the same boat, as audiences have been kept away by the complicated plot, which also seems to work quite well. The film starts with the brutal murder of a CIA agent, who has a secret vital to national security in his head. Out of desperation, the CIA turns to a doctor and an experimental procedure, which will allow the agents memories to be transferred into someone else's mind. The only problem is that the procedure requires a certain type of mind, the mind of a psychopath. Against his will, Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner) is transferred to CIA headwaters and given the agents memories, but will he become the good agent and help save the world, or will he return to his murderous ways? Kevin Costner stars and reminds us all of what a terrific actor he truly is. It's hard to remember, considering that for the passed two decades he's done mostly romantic garbage, that you couldn't pay me to sit through. Costner returns to action as if he'd never been gone and does an amazing job playing this deeply conflicted, flawed man. Paired with an all-star cast, that features a ton of cameos, Criminal never slows down and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's not really the CIA crisis or the science fiction that keeps your interest throughout, it's the conflict growing in Jericho Stewart's brain, as he has essential turned into a person that is both good and evil. Yes, the story is a bit complicated, but it is fairly easy to follow, and Kevin Costner gives his best performance in at least a decade, making Criminal well worth the price of admission."" ]"
interstellar;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Christopher Nolan is the smartest writer/director in Hollywood, so smart that a lot of people claim his films are over their heads. The master of twists and deception made Batman real, showed us how dreams work in Inception, and brought us inside the dangerous world of magic in the Presitige. In his latest film, Interstellar, Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive. This film does have a great twist in the end and some terrific special effects, but beyond that it is one of the longest and slowest moving films I've seen in years. Once again, Humans have finally destroyed Earth and have gone looking for a new home, but outside our solar system, things are much different than they appear. Time and gravity are different concepts in different regions of space, and the effects on the crew, who had hoped to one day see their families again, diminish with each passing day. Matthew McConaughey stars and as is the case with most of his films, he's terrific. Based on some of the poor choices he made in his younger years, he has a bad rep among critics, but the fact is that he's always fun to watch, and is one of the most intense actors out there today. As for the rest of the film, it's usually Nolan's genius that makes the film unique and special, but in this instance he was too smart for his own good. The story moves very slowly and at times is more than somewhat confusing, not to mention at nearly three hours long, it's a challenge to sit through to even reach his famous twist at the end. Nolan films are something I always look forward to, as they are different and both entertain me and make me think, but in this case, I was just beyond bored and fed up with the whole thing. I guess sometimes even genius takes a holiday."" ]"
deadpool;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Deadpool is the most anticipated Marvel movie since the Avengers and for good reason. If you are unfamiliar with the character, Deadpool is the outcast of the superhero world. He's got the moves and the abilities, but rarely does or says the right thing, for that matter, he doesn't get along much with anyone either. Ryan Reynolds stars as the not so super hero, and he is literally perfect for the role, it's as if the comic book was written last week with Reynolds specifically in mind, it was that great of a match. There is certainly a ton of hype around the character, the actor, and where it may eventually lead, but the truth is that the story really isn't anything special. I assume the film is meant to be about the character and how funny he is, making the story an after thought, but how can that be in a major motion picture? The film is your typical, guy falls in love, loses his girl because of a bad guy, and then goes looking for revenge, a common theme in every Marvel film. There is nothing different, exciting, or shocking about the story. For the purposes of Deadpool, it's all about the character. He curses, he kills, he makes fun of other Marvel films, and yes he's very funny, but to me, it was also a bit over the top. Since being acquired by Disney, Marvel is trying more and more to appeal to adult audiences and wants to show that its films can be just as bloody and crude as anybody elses, point made. The first time I watched Deadpool, I thought it was a weak story and a little over the top, but the second time I saw it, I thought it was a weak story and really over the top. The bottom line, the character is great, Ryan Reynolds is amazing, there are some great one-liners and laugh out loud moments, but as far as the story goes, it leaves a lot to be desired, as it was predictable, weak, and has been done time and time again."" ]"
x-men-apocalypse;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""What is everyone complaining about? I am by no means a superhero fan, in fact, aside from Batman and the X-Men, I really don't care, but as someone who has been into X-Men since he was a kid, and seen just about everything, the day it came out, I really can't understand all the bad reviews and the complaints about violence towards women! This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it! Apocalypse might not have been as good as First Class or Days of Future Past, but it certainly wasn't a stinker on the level of Last Stand, the way that most critics portrayed it to be."" ]"
middle-school-the-worst-years-of-my-life;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Based on the best selling novel by the same name, it was widely believed that this would be the next Diary of a Wimpy Kid, sadly it was not. Griffin Gluck was fantastic is his first starring role, but the rest of the cast really didn't have much chemistry, and overall the film just wasn't all that funny. Rafe Katchadorian (Gluck) is a troubled kid, who is sent to his third and final Middle School in the district. It's very strict and if he doesn't follow the rules, he could be headed to military school. Once he gets there, Rafe learns that his principle (Andrew Daly) is beyond strict and decides to get back at him by anonymous breaking not one, but all his rules, causing a school wide rebellion. The story seemed like a good one, but the truth is the pranks weren't all that extreme or funny. The kids in the theater laughed more at the preview before the film than they did at the pranks in the movie. There were also times in the film where you expected the typical crude middle school humor, and while the writers set it up, they never delivered the punch line. That's not the only issue with this film, the kids had some chemistry, but the family didn't. Lauren Graham was terrible, as her character was completely different than that of her kids. She had no connection to them or any idea what was going on with them. But for as bad as she was, it was nothing compared to how awful Rob Riggle was. I have never been a fan of his, but he was beyond annoying in this film, his personality is just so obnoxious and over the top, that the last place he belongs is in a family film. Finally, the whole animation angle brings the movie to a dead stop. Gluck's character is an artist and likes to draw, and at times throughout the film, his drawings come to life in his imagination and take the place of what's happening on the screen, often at the worst possible times. The bottom line, for young actors in a family film, Gluck and Thomas Barbusca did a terrific job, but the story fails to live up to expectations, the humor just isn't there, and the whole thing was full of scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor."" ]"

Lex Luther is supposed to be the most refreshing villain in comic movie history because he always keeps his cool and is a perfect politician.  But Jesse Eisenberg being the 1 trick pony, turned him into the typical weird nerdy genius that is in just about every other comic movie.  If you don't know about the missed opportunity, think Little Finger from Game of Throne, but even smarter and more powerful.  Every scene with Lex in this movie is a total disaster and the clash of ideology was watered down by the meddling.  Another foolish thing is... they made batman have a anger tantrum...  it's not just the trailer exaggerating. Batman really has just a stupid anger tantrum as teenage-immature as in the trailer.  just facepalm all over.  It's a reimagining of batman... that turn into crap.  Batman's only unique \""super power\"" was his near perfect control, planning and life-experience over all others.  They took that away in this movie. This is especially important in Justice League situation.  If every fricking character in Justice League is an emotional hot head who throws anger tantrum... well... it's going to turn into a sht mess and there is no longer character differences... just costume and power difference... that completely pales in comparison to why Marvel movies are good."" ]"

The story is fast paced, humorous, visually stunning and emotionally gripping, ensuring director JJ Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan have successfully returned us to a galaxy far, far away. Whilst each member of the original cast was brilliant, it was the new cast that stole the show, particularly Daisy Ridley’s portrayal of Rey, and Adam Driver’s terrifyingly powerful yet human display of Kylo Ren. Such characters were subject to magical settings and themes and more fantastical elements displayed than ever before, and it was brilliant. Whilst no film is perfect, demonstrated as a few characters were underdeveloped and will hopefully play a bigger role in future acts, no character is expendable however and whether they are on screen for thirty seconds or an hour, each has a part to play in the progression of the story. The magic of the force, the magic of the lightsaber, the magic of aliens and starships, the magic of the Star Wars blockbuster, the magic has all returned and promises to thrive for years to come. The Force Awakens exceeds all expectations, and with perhaps one of the most emotional and spectacular final shot’s in any film to date, the audience is left both wanting to immediately watch the movie again and wanting to watch Episode 8.

The knock on Ben Affleck is that his acting has a bit of an emotionally restricted range to begin with, and thus playing a character with a high-functioning form of Autism is right up his alley, but it works for him in this movie, so who cares.  Anna Kendrick shines, and makes the most out of a somewhat limited role.  Hopefully, we will start to see more movies with her in a lead role."" ]"

Set in current day rural west Texas, the movie paints a bleak landscape of small towns with vacant store fronts and ranch lands dotted with For Sale signs.  Average citizens struggle to make ends meet, and not a single character in the movie has a future to look forward to. Their lives twist slowly in the wind, and the slow pace of director David Mackensie’s movie left me feeling much the same way. The economic disparity between the Haves (banks and the oil companies) and the Have Nots has become so burdensome that Toby (Chris Pine) and his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) have nothing to left lose by going desperado.  Jeff Bridges plays a deft and skillful sheriff on the verge of a retirement that he’s not looking forward to.  He jokes to his partner about going out in a blaze of glory.  His fatal flaw is a lack of cultural sensitivity which, when combined with an unalterable sense of right and wrong, make it impossible for him to comprehend the cultural and moral schism that is occurring.   The story embodies the kind of social injustice message that Hollywood loves.  Yet, this movie can’t be dismissed so easily.  The message is delivered with more subtleness than blunt force, and the ending is not what you would expect. The acting is solid on all fronts, and there are some guilty pleasures to be had in watching the vigilantes take in on the chin.

However, the 3D doesn’t really add much to the movie, so feel free to see it in standard format.  The most unrealistic aspect of the movie is probably the way the climbers are dressed.

Most of the events in the movie are ‘pre-storm’ and I thought more time should have been spent depicting events that occurred during the storm.  This lack of detail left me confused about what really happened.

Spotlight painstakingly avoids the later and the typical Hollywood happy ending."", """", ""Instead, the movie is an introspection which attempts to focus on identifying how something so disgusting and so widespread could have gone on for so long.  The movie answers this question in an unexpected manner that is the ultimate indictment of Catholic orthodoxy, which seeks to imbue the faithful with a belief that the church is both inherently good and infallible in its decision making (and thus is not to be questioned) and that man, who is born sinful, should feel guilty about everything that he does (or in this case, doesn’t do)."", """", ""The only real tension in the movie comes when the audience learns that information about priests molesting children was previously sent to the newspaper many years ago, but the newspaper failed to act on it, and that someone may have deliberately buried it.

But it’s not necessarily the kind of movie that appeals to today’s younger generation (who, like Francis Gary Powers, seem to be a bit of an anathema).   I was interested in seeing this movie because, although I was just a kid, I was alive when the events depicted in this movie occurred and I have at least some, albeit vague, recollection about U-2 spy planes, how controversial the reconnaissance missions flown by these planes were, and about Gary Powers being shot down and captured by the Soviets.

The cast is deep (including Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Beneicio Del Toro, Maya Rudolph and Jena Malone).  Brolin is perfectly cast for his role, which is a send-up of the quintessential 1960’s LA police detective.

I find that both actors can be either really interesting or really tedious.  As a result I wasn’t expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie is much more watchable than the reviews would indicate.  Duval plays an aging small town judge with high standards and an impeccable record, who may have committed a murder.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the prodigal son, who left town many years ago with a chip on his shoulder and has become a talented and cynical lawyer who defends wealthy sleaze balls.  The story is more about the redemption of their relationship and finding their humanity for each other, than it is a courtroom drama.

The most depressing part of the movie comes when Margo and Boney ultimately recognize that they are completely impotent in affecting behaviors or outcomes.  Bolt seems to have come to this same conclusion sometime in the past, but sees it all a game.  The most memorable line in the movie is given by Bolt when, with a chuckle, he tells Nick that, “You two are the most f**ked up people I’ve ever met.”"", ""Around the two hour mark, the movie has a “Carrie” moment, where Amy returns home drenched in blood.

Where the movie falls short is in its direction and the lack of a particularly new or unique story line.  The film contains too many contradictions, which kill its credibility."", ""Director (David Ryan) seems intent on sending the message that death in war is totally random.  Paradoxically, everyone who dies in this movie is killed by a perfect shot.  We are shown many sudden violent deaths, but the large number of people who get stabbed cleanly through the eye socket or have their head blown off straight across the neckline, in a relatively bloodless and painless way, seems oddly unrealistic.  (About halfway through, you may find yourself wondering how many people have had their heads shot clean off.)  Compounding the problem, Pitt does most of his fighting on top his tank, rather than inside it.  The movie reminds us that in WWII American tanks had inferior amour plate, and we see tank after tank destroyed from a single enemy hit.  Yet, when Pitt’s tank runs over a mine buried in the road, it merely disables the tank tread.  Moments later we see one of Pitt’s crew running up that same road, apparently unconcerned about the presence of additional mines.  The final sequence is reminiscent of the movie 300, with Pitt fighting off dozens of crack SS troupes from on top of his tank.  None seem capable of hitting a fixed and exposed human target, except fora German sniper, inexplicably dressed in full camo gear (including a stringy face cover) despite the fact that it’s nighttime and pitch black outside."", ""Classic WWII movies from the 1960’s like Patton, The Longest Day, and Battle of the Bulge, though highly romanticized, have more interesting story lines about the history of WWII.  In the 1980’s, Platoon and Apocalypse Now showed us bizarreness and insanity of war.  In the 1990’s, Saving Private Ryan, showed us the real imagery and noise of war, reminded us why sometimes we have to fight, and the depth of the sacrifices that some individuals have made in the name of freedom.  The only unique sequence in Fury occurs when Pitt, after helping liberate a German town, protects two vulnerable women from possible rape and abuse from his own men, which may account for the final oddity of this movie: women seem to find this movie appealing."" ]"

her;9;4;Axgrinder;"[ ""‘Her’ is one of those movies that got snubbed by the 2014 Oscar nominating committee.  The first thought I had after seeing the movie was, “How did Spike Jonze ever think something like that up!”  The material is incredibly original, and it probably should have received a nomination for best original screenplay.  The movie is also well cast. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is first rate.  It’s too bad he doesn’t seem to be well liked by the Hollywood crowd.  While I’m not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, she is quite credible and does an excellent job of expressing emotion as a disembodied voice.  Having recently seen American Hustle I had a hard time getting used to the rather timid character portrayed by Amy Adams.  Though I’m not sure you would call ‘Her’ Best Picture material, it’s a far better movie than Wolf of Wall Street."", """", ""That being said, this movie is not for everyone.  It’s definitely different, but has the potential to become something of a cult classic.  (Think ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, with a more conventional ending).  The movie is set in the near future, but the future is a bit of a sterile, lonely and nerdy place.  People are hesitant.  They don’t interact with each other well, and when they do, their conversations are awkward and their behavior is forced.  (Some reviewers seem to mistake this for bad acting.)  Fashion has also taken a turn for the worse, as people in the future dress badly (especially the men who seem to favor really high-waisted pants)."", """", ""Although the basic premise of the movie “Lonely man falls in love with the voice on his operating system” sounds a bit creepy, and might have been if Jonze hadn’t done such an excellent job, the movie really isn’t the least bit so.  The ‘sex’ in this movie is of a variety that is intended to make you a bit uncomfortable.  There is only a brief bit of traditional (gratuitous?) female nudity, and no traditional action scenes, which again may discourage the average viewer. But, if you are still reading this, then don’t be discouraged about seeing it, it’s a terrific movie.  It’s a story about loneliness.  It’s about the basic need for companionship, the struggle to fulfill that need, and the mistakes we make along the way.  If you’re open to that kind of story, then I highly recommend this movie."" ]"

It’s a curmudgeon movie.  Bill Murray’s Boston accent takes a bit of getting used to.  Is it a bit predictably?  Yes, but this is not a thriller, so it doesn’t diminish the fun.  Is the story original?  Yes, it didn’t remind me of a bunch of other movies I’ve already seen.   Is it a kid’s movie?  Nope.  The themes are mostly adult.  Is it vulgar?  The humor is ribald at times, but the movie avoids the kind of blatantly crude, shock humor you see in today’s typical comedy.  Why didn’t it get higher ratings from the critics?  It’s the kind of movie that professional critics find uninteresting.   It doesn’t break new ground.  It’s not epic.  There is no unusual cinematography.   It doesn’t contain any biting social commentary.  It’s not about our dystopian future.  It’s doesn’t contain senseless violence and a tragic ending.  This one is pure enjoyment.  Unless you're crankier than Bill Murray's character, it's hard not to be entertained by this movie."" ]"

The majority of the scenes involve Witherspoon by herself so if you didn’t like Gravity because the film centered on Sandra Bullock then you may not like this flick either.  The movie is based on the true story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman unable to cope with her own life.  Weighed down with frustration and grief from the death of her sweet, but white trash, mother (Laura Dern) and unable to connect emotionally with her nice guy husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski), her only release comes from engaging in some seriously self-destructive behavior.  But, Paul ultimately her leaves her for her infidelities and she realizes that she’s no longer in control (not that she ever was) and that she’s allowed her life to spiral down dangerously close to the edge of the abyss.  She tries cut-rate psycho-therapy for about 5 minute before giving up.  When the therapist asks why she does the things she does, she responds by saying, the only time life doesn’t hurt like sh*t is when I’m fuc*ing someone or shooting up.  As an act of desperation, and despite the fact that she has no backpacking experience, she leaves home (Minneapolis) to hike the 1,100 mile Pacific Crest Trail - which runs from the Mojave Desert in California to Washington State - by herself.  The movie is about her trek.  The movie has a grittiness and real-life feel to it.  The only odd moment occurs in the closing scene where, despite the fact that the journey proves to be her salvation, Cheryl tries to embrace her past rather than renounce it and claims that she doesn’t seek or need forgiveness or redemption.  It’s a prideful “broken but unbowed” final speech, which I found interesting given that her survival appears to be founded as much on luck and the kindness of strangers as it is on her own inner strength.  But, despite Cheryl’s lack of humility, you still feel good that she makes it through both the Pacific wilderness and her own personal wilderness and through to other side.  Stay and watch the credits for some interesting photographs of the real Cheryl."" ]"

There are no milestones in his life to celebrate, no tragedies to mourn, no joyous moments, no outbursts of anger; just long periods of monotonous existence.

He sees his kids on weekends, tries hard to engage them in conversation, and gives them the kind of talks that you would expect from a Dad in a movie like Sixteen Candles.  The speeches come across as odd because Dad lives with a professional musician in a dirty apartment complete with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts and a little drug paraphernalia.  Thus, his words are completely incongruent with the life that he lives."", """", ""Mom’s life is like a twisted version of Ground Hog Day.

The injustice suffered by Alan Turig (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is so horrific it’s hard to image that what happened to him occurred little more than 60 years ago.  Unfortunately, the movie just isn’t as interesting as it should be. It feels slow because the story is told in a very safe and old fashioned sort of way.  I felt like I was watching Tinker Tailor Solder Spy except there wasn’t any intrigue and I didn’t have to engage my brain to try and figure anything out.  Cumberbatch is very believable in the role of a gay, socially awkward and self-absorbed genius.  Charles Dance (in something of a reprise of his role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones) plays a powerful military commander who simply doesn’t like Turig, much in the way that Tywin Lannister doesn’t like his son Tyrion.  Kiera Knightley is okay as Turig’s genius, old-maid colleague, but her character is rather boring.  The most interesting character is that of Mi6 spook Stewart Menzies, (played by Mark Strong, also from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), who knows who everyone is and what they are about, but is using them all for his own purposes and doesn’t really care what they do in their private lives.  I liked the movie because it tells an important story about WWII that I didn’t know, but the movie itself just didn’t “wow” me."" ]"

The firefight scenes are exceptionally realistic, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, but with slightly less intensity.  On that basis alone, I would consider American Sniper to be one of the top 10 war movies of all time.  Bradley Cooper gives a solid, but emotionally range limited performance of a rugged individualist who never waivers in his understated, but rock-solid, patriotism for American.  Kyle’s primary mission is to use his sniper rifle to guard and protect his fellow soldiers who are tasked with doing the door-to-door fighting in the streets of Iraq.  He is so good at his job he ends up with the rather burdensome nickname of “The Legend”."", """", ""Kyle comes home for good after 4 tours of duty having killed more men, women and children than he cares to remember, mostly after having viewed them through his long-range rifle scope.  Kyle is an extremely well-centered individual with exceptional mental toughness, but 1000 plus days of combat duty, combined with being so heavily relied upon by others for protecting their lives, is going to take its toll on you, and Kyle unconsciously copes with the stress by drying up emotionally and becoming something of a shell.  Kyle’s wife (Sienna Miller) recognizes Kyle’s emotional withdraw early on in their relationship, but sticks with her man anyway."", """", ""Unfortunately, Director Clint Eastwood spends so much time in Iraq, that there is little time left for the movie to explore Kyle’s post-war life.

We are shown only a very short scene in which Kyle meets with a therapist who tells Kyle that there are still soldiers out there (returning combat veterans) who need him to rescue them.  Kyle’s emotional recovery seems instantaneous, and Eastwood’s shallow treatment of the issue left me wondering what really happened.  The end of the movie comes quickly thereafter.

I’ve been told that the movie skips over large segments of Job’s life, and thus some feel the movie is unbalanced or an unfair in its portrayal of him, while others have told me that the guy was, in many ways, even more bizzare than what the movie shows.  All in all, I think it’s fair to say that the movie attempts to give you a sense of who he was without laboring over every detail.  I leave it to others to debate the accuracy of the material presented, but if you’re an Apple aficionado, you may not care for this movie because it colors pretty much all of the company founders as timid or inept buffoons who couldn’t run business selling beer to beach goers in July, much less a computer company."" ]"

This new one is much the same thing: a well-crafted, sometimes riveting thrill ride. Basically, it's an extended chase as she frantically pursues the kidnappers of her 6-year-old son. Much of it takes place careening down a highway with nail-biting driving and quick crashes. The subsequent encounters may strain credibility but they're equally fraught with tension. If you can forgive the gaps in the logic and some trite setups, you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat or even screaming at the screen!"" ]"
the-hero;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This movie was written for Sam Elliott and it's a blessing for us and him. He gives a performance of such beautiful subtlety and touching depth that he will surely appear on this year's awards nominations. He plays a 70+ actor who's iconic role was in a Western 40 years ago. He's still struggling to maintain, while smoking a lot of pot and dealing with a cancer diagnosis. His interactions with the rest of the excellent cast (including Katharine Ross, his real-life wife) intensify his longing and add underplayed passion to the story. The occasional venture into artsy dream sequences slows the pace and adds more pretention than meaning. Despite a script that's overload with the character's frustrations, the movie is worth seeing for Elliott's nuanced and moving portrayal."" ]"
the-beguiled;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This film takes place at a girls' boarding school in Virginia during the Civil War. When they give refuge to a wounded Union soldier (handsome, seductive Colif Farrell), his presence has a provocative effect on the women (including Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst & Elle Fanning). Although the performances are captivating and the interactions enthralling, it's director Sofia Coppola's delicate direction and cinematographer Phillipe Le Sourd gorgeous images that stand out. The pacing may be too genteel for people without patience and the drama never realizes it's emotional fervor. Still, it's restrained world and the drama that develops is quietly compelling. (There was a lot of moss on those Central Virginia trees, something I've never seen and I've been in VA for 50 years.)"" ]"

The directorial debut by Geremy Jasper is sometimes flashy, but he manages to capture the frustration and energy of his characters' world (the music's not bad either).

baby-driver;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""In his first major film role (\""The Fault in Our Stars\""), I described Ansel Elgort as \""cute, charismatic and charming.\"" Now, you can cool action star to that list. He plays a getaway driver extraordinaire, who listens to music while he performs amazing getaways and impressive stunts. The crooks he works with (including Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx & Jon Hamm) add all sorts of conflicts. Then there's his love at first site (a lovely and charming Lily James). While the crooks gets to chew on the scenery, it's Elgort's sweet style that holds it all together. What really makes the movie such a winner is Edgar White, who's written a sharp, engrossing vehicle (pun intended) and infused it with outstanding stunts, clever directorial touches and a killer soundtrack. It's popcorn fun from the impressive opening chase to appropriate ending. The most fun of the summer, so far."" ]"

A group of space explorers land on a remote planet where lives \""guess who?\"" There are some electric encounters that seem more intense and extended that in the past, but there are also plenty of concentrated dialogue passages (and more emotion). Since the scenario's a given, it's up to the filmmakers to offer something new. They didn't. But this film still plays out with grand visuals and a sprinkling of violent, tense alien encounters."" ]"
war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""You may recall that the last movie in this series was less an action film and more a political conflict. This one puts even more emphasis on the drama, almost to the exclusion of any big battles. Caesar fights back against a human army (led by Woody Harrelson), but there's more heart-felt conversation and sneaking around than full out fighting. That being said, the animation of the apes is even more impressively effective in conveying emotions (led by another remarkable performance from Andy Serkis). While much of the interactions are compelling, almost every scene plays out too long.  Once again, Michael Seresin's cinematography turns some stunning locations into beautiful images and the simian characterizations are enthralling. While Matt Reeves' distinctive directorial vision is engrossing and at times unique, it's more about emotion than action. (This much ape interaction means lots of subtitles to translate their hairy gestures.)"" ]"
the-lovers-2017;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""This film should be considered a melodrama, not because of the traditional definition, but because of the wretched orchestral accompaniment that pervades this film like a soap opera. Debra Winger and Tracy Letts play a long-time couple in a stale marriage. Both of them are having an affair and headed for divorce when they re-discover their love for each other. Since the plot is relatively simple, it's up to the performances and direction to make it work. Luckily, Winger and Letts are both wonderfully nuanced as the couple in a complex situation. The filmmaking is less successful. In addition to the music that's distracting as hell, the plot meanders thru the interactions with an \""adult\"" pace (meaning slow). Still, this film tells a mature and appealing story."" ]"

He returns to make amends and catch up with the gang. Much hasn't changed for them or for director Danny Boyle. He still crams the film full of vibrant imagery, flashy editing, a pounding soundtrack and mildly extreme moments. (The Scottish accents are still sometimes hard to crack.) Flashbacks from the original add poignant moments, but the guys are as spunky as ever. There's not a lot of plot…just interactions between them, but it still holds up as a flashy cinematic reunion."" ]"
spider-man-homecoming;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The big question for this newest reboot of the franchise is: how is it different from all the others? Primarily, it's Tom Holland, who brings a fresh-faced charm to the character. He's still in high school, while working to get accepted as a superhero by the Avengers. Since he's also adolescent, he's awkward and impetuous, which gets him in several scrapes. The action sequences seem more lighthearted and the villain (Michael Keaton) is less threatening. Still, Holland's awkward spunk and endearing appeal, combined with a lighthearted script and energetic approach make this iteration enjoyable. BTW, the plot picks up after the last Captain America movie (which featured a fun cameo from Spidey), so if you didn't see it, some of the references may be lost, but the movie still works. NOTE: As usual with Marvel flix, stay thru the credits for one last gag."" ]"

Sixteen years later, the teen (Asa Butterfield) travels to Earth to meet a girl and find his father. This is an interesting blend of typical science fiction, adolescent romance and getaway flick. While there are holes in the plot (and the science), there's enuff mild adventure and fish-out-of-water humor to keep it interesting. It only bogs down with syrupy drama a few times. In addition to those incredible blue eyes (that often look like they're crying), Butterfield charmingly creates a sweet, smart character. The chase part of the plot strains credibility and the final outcome isn't expected, but there's still sufficient entertainment to capture the imagination"" ]"

john-wick-chapter-2;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Keanu Reeves returns as a severe hit man. As with the first movie, this one is more about style (cool locations and blasting music) than story (minimal, hackneyed dialogue).

When they return home from their production of \""Death of a Salesman,\"" an unfortunate incident launches the drama with grief and suspicion. In American hands, this would be a high-pitched angry drama, but in the apprehensive culture of Iran and the underplayed style of the director, it's rendered as a more sober experience. There's virtually no music. The pacing is deliberate. Tension rises slightly during the compelling final encounter, but it remains emotionally subdued. This film provides interesting cultural insights and subtle performances, but the meandering pace requires patience."" ]"
i-am-not-your-negro;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""James Baldwin was a distinguished black writer and an outspoken critic of race relations in America. There are elements of a traditional doc in this film, but it's more an artistic treatise using Baldwin's eloquent words (quietly voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and charismatic on-screen appearances to delineate his musings on the subject. It's supported with disturbing historical photos and excerpts from Hollywood films. There is a focus on 3 great leaders of the civil rights movement (Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King), but the extended analysis sometimes becomes repetitive or seems to ramble. Even so, this is a forceful examination that sadly still rings true more than 50 years later."" ]"

We watch his daily routine: he gets up, drives his bus (and pens his poetry), spends the evening with his devoted wife, walks the dog and drops by a local bar for a beer. This is a low-key character study from deadpan director Jim Jarmusch. While it's always interesting, almost nothing happens…just observations of his life and love. (The dog provides some delightful lighter moments.) Driver's soulful eyes dominate his sensitive portrayal and the final scenes are truly moving. Jarmusch's quiet observations and poetic montages combined with quietly compelling situations create a sweetly affecting cinematic poem."" ]"
walking-with-the-enemy;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Inspired by a true story, this film follows a brave young man (Jonas Armstrong) who poses as a Nazi officer to save other Jews in Budapest. This well-constructed (if not somewhat formulaic) film depicts German cruelty and the bravery of those who stood up to them. It's attractively shot, well acted and directed with passion. Although the drama sometimes gets a bit heavy-handed, it remains an absorbing fim with a charismatic leading man. My minor beefs: everyone speaks with accents (in their own language!) and Armstrong always has a 5 o'clock shadow (which the Nazis would never tolerate)."" ]"
patriots-day;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""Mark Wahlberg plays a police officer involved in the search to find the terrorists behind the Boston Marathon bombing. This is one of several POVs in this gripping drama: It also explores stories of several survivors, the law enforcement procedures behind the pursuit and even the activities of the criminals. Director Peter Berg depicts the horrific event with electrifying skill and maintains the tension throughout the search, which includes several potent action sequences. The continual drone in the soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross helps keep the pressure up. The cast is uniformly outstanding with Wahlberg exploring new emotional depths in his best screen performance yet. Not only is this a riveting, suspenseful police procedural, it takes an empowering patriotic stance that ultimately yields a moving final message."" ]"

He's working as a chauffeur (driving a beautiful Chrysler limo) attempting to stay unnoticed in a near future world where most mutants have died out. When a young girl with special powers shows up, he's forced into take her on the run. This is a more intimate take on the superhero genre. Yes, there are several great claw-slashing scenes, but there's also a more personal drama and less flashy special effects. Writer/director James Mangold has given the film a bleak personal perspective and managed some nice twists to keep it interesting. While not breaking any new ground for cool visuals, it does break the mold with a more dramatically compelling (yet still action fused) take on the genre. NOTE: Don't be late. There's a funny new promo for DEADPOOL 2 right before the film."" ]"
jackie;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Jackie isn't a traditional biopic, but a searing, intimate and sometimes unflattering portrait of the former First Lady. It revolves around the interview she granted the week after her husband's assassination and features numerous flashbacks, mostly during the events leading up to and immediately following the world-shattering event. We see Jackie go thru many emotions and Natalie Portman carries them all off with astounding insight and skill. This is a condensed character study that's wrapped in an art film package. The soundtrack is heavy-handed and intrusive, but I think it was director Pablo Larraín's intention to make the whole experience less than comfortable. Even though, the portrayal and insights are fascinating."" ]"

Naturally, they escape and all manner of mayhem ensues. The visual effects are remarkable and the beasts are truly fantastic. On the other hand, the story isn't especially inventive and the direction lacks personality. Even Redmayne resorts to the gawky, awkward style that's often apparent in his work. While there are clever moments and a few mildly enjoyable characters, it's just a noisy, jumbled disarray by the end. The overall effect is visually dazzling and fun to watch, but not especially captivating on a human level."" ]"
wonder-woman;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""The DC comics universe has been trying to catch up with Marvel for years and this may be the movie that does it. This origin story starts on a secluded island where she lives among the Amazons. When a handsome spy crash lands (charmingly amusing Chris Pine), he brings the bleak reality of WWI, which motivates her to fight for peace. Gal Gadot is beautiful and vulnerable, yet tough in the title role. Perfect casting. Director Patty Jenkins has fashioned an adventure with strong visuals and beautifully stylized action. As with so many superhero flix, it could have been 30 minutes shorter. Also, the climactic battle fell back on the typical tropes of a tired superhero encounter. Still, it checks most of the boxes for a visually appealing and amply engaging superhero movie."" ]"
elle;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""This movie starts with a rape. The woman who's attacked (Isabelle Huppert), goes into stealth mode, playing down the effects of this act of aggression. There are some notable parallels: she runs a company that creates violent video games and a relative is a serial killer. This film seems like it's headed to a revenge narrative (it is directed by Paul Verhoven, who's no stranger to sex and violence in his work), but expands into a compelling character study of a seemingly stable woman harboring a number of issues. Huppert is always fascinating to watch, even as the character seems to spiral in unexpected directions. It's not exemplary, but it is an unusual, complex and interesting experience."" ]"

While Wilson's language borders on poetic, the father's unsympathetic character makes the situations hard to handle. Of course, the performances are superb with Davis' sensitive portray illuminating the screen. Director Washington has kept every moment of this long encounter compelling (it runs 2:19) with crackling energy and dynamic force. Still, it feels like a cinematic staging of a theatrical presentation with the attendant embellished dialogue, hyper-focused encounters and larger than life emotions."" ]"
get-out;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams make a cute couple: He's black and she's white. When they go to meet her parents, the extremely accommodating family and some weirdly off-kilter help cause concern..and more. Writer/director Jordan Peele has created a slowly mounting sense of fear that's more about racial tension than cinematic scares. Still, the sinister portent builds with steady apprehension that leads to a brutal outcome. While satirical observations on prejudice add humor (and some plot points strain logic), the overall effect is suitably chilling and completely entertaining."" ]"
hacksaw-ridge;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This film is based on the true story of a conscientious objector (played by Andrew Garfield) who saved the lives of 75 men during the bloodiest battle of WWII. Before hitting the battlefield, the narrative sets up the events that formed his beliefs, the woman back home who supported him and the intense antagonism he faced from the Army. His rich, yet subtle performance once again proves that Garfield is one of the finest actors of his generation. As for director Mel Gibson, the romantic and emotional elements are richly told (albeit in a traditional structure and style), but it's the staging of the battle that makes the strongest impression: The most gruesome and violently brutal depiction of the horrors of battle since \""Private Ryan.\"" Even though it could easily lose 30 of its 131-minutes, this remains a potent drama and an affecting portrait of a brave and principled man."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""You can certainly tell that writer/director Tom Ford is also a fashion mogul, cause this film is crammed with stylistic flair: beautiful people, lovely lighting, elegant locations and cool clothes. It's also a somewhat gripping suspense drama. Amy Adams plays a fancy LA gallery owner who gets a copy of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) novel, which is a thinly disguised revenge narrative. The film alternates between her reading it, the story being reenacted and flashbacks to their past relationship. The concept is sometimes clever as it pieces the parts together, but sometimes it's merely dominated by the beauty of the design. Adams and Gyllenhaal are both fine, but the standout performance comes from Michael Shannon as the sheriff.  Even though the movie is compelling and sensual, the drama doesn't always live up to the aesthetics."" ]"

Jennifer Lawrence plays the woman who shares this unfortunate accident and they set out to determine what changed their fate. Their plight manages to maintain interest and the futuristic design adds a layer of cool. Even though their chemistry is fine, this is really Pratt's movie: he beautifully manages to capture the confusion, longing, desperation and other emotions that plague his plight. Even though some of the plot elements give way to traditional Hollywood structure, the whole adventure is packaged in a wondrous sci-fi world that makes it fun to explore."" ]"
doctor-strange;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Benedict Cumberbatch is the latest actor to enter the Marvel Universe. He plays an arrogant neurosurgeon who suffers a devastating accident and resorts to mysticism for a \""cure.\"" This results in his acquisition of superpowers and a cool cape. Unlike many of these flicks, this one doesn't rely on typically destructive physical encounters. Instead there are trippy visual effects and cool superpowers. There are also several tedious scenes of metaphysical mumbo jumbo that stop the pace and a sometimes confusing sense of what's actually happening. Cumberbatch ably handles his character's haughtiness with depth. There's also a touch of humor to keep things from getting too self-important. Overall, it's more original and better than many in the franchise, but it's still somewhat mystifying and overly talky. NOTE: As usual, stay thru the credits for a somewhat puzzling teaser."" ]"
loving;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""This film is based on the true case of Mildred and Richard Loving, an interracial couple who lived in Virginia (where the film was also shot) and ultimately challenged the miscegenation laws in the Supreme Court. This film quietly tells their story without overblown outrage or extreme emotion. Director Jeff Nichols lets images, especially faces, poignantly tell as much of the story as the minimal dialogue. With the sweetly touching, skillfully underplayed performances by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga (both of whom will surely see Oscar noms) their situation is rendered even more poignant. Some may find the pace slow, but I found it quietly compelling. In addition to the historical significance of the case, this film beautifully portrays the enduring love that made their relationship transcend racial boundaries."" ]"
the-accountant;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Ben Affleck plays a math savant on the Autism spectrum who spends his days as a quiet CPA, but freelances for major criminal organizations and even mortally dispatches some of them. The narrative also involves flashbacks to his father's influence, a sympathetic clerk who arouses his affection (Anna Kendrick) and a government agent who's out to stop him (J.K. Simmons). The premise seems a bit preposterous and it's not really clear how the plot's complex machinations happen. Affleck stays pretty stone faced thru it all, registering as a mysteriously-connected mastermind and a sure-shot action hero. There's enuff complexity in the story to keep it interesting and a few moments of action to add some fun. If you can get past the ludicrousness of the story, you may enjoy watching it all unfold."" ]"

Three actors play him as a boy, a teen and a man and they're all exceptional, finding the character's soul with few words and expressive eyes. Our heart breaks as he struggles with his addicted mother, bullying classmates and his own sexuality. First time writer/director Barry Jenkins let's every scene play out with compelling quiet: Simple and underplayed, but with an underlying intensity that's achingly bittersweet. This is a somber, poetic film experience with tender, yet powerful performances . An unexpected drama from an insightful and gifted director."" ]"
deepwater-horizon;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""The focus of this film is not on the environmental damage caused by the titular oil explosion, but on the crew members who fought and died during the disaster. Mark Wahlberg plays one especially heroic worker, but the true star is director Peter Berg (look for him in a cameo when the helicopter lands). He sets up the culture with quick-cut macho exchanges, but his magnificent recreation of the chaos and calamity makes the experience exceptionally gripping. It's a dizzying outburst of devastation. While the film clearly indicts BP as the greedy villain, the epic endeavor to avert, then survive the disaster, is riveting."" ]"
the-birth-of-a-nation;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""For those who don't remember their history, Nat Turner (played with poignant power by Nate Parker) was a slave and preacher in 1800s Virginia, who led the country's largest slave rebellion. This film, which is a masterful first effort by writer/director Nate Parker, doesn't revel in the violence or extreme cruelty. Even though there are appropriately brutal moments, he's chosen to focus on the emotional experiences that led to Turner's transformation. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are forceful. It takes a bit too long to build momentum, but once it does, the film builds to moving and powerful final image."" ]"

Like the predecessors, this film is breezy and fun. The women in the audience were laughing a lot more than I did, but I was still entertained. The pace is spritely and the situations amusing. The men are charming and her dilemma is sweet. Fans of the series will likely find themselves warmly rewarded."" ]"
florence-foster-jenkins;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Meryl Streep creates another memorable character: This one is based on the real woman who was rich and loved music, but was a hilariously horrible singer. She makes the character delightful, sweet and touching. As her devotedly protective husband, Hugh Grant is solid and charming, but it's Simon Helberg, as her pianist, who steals the movie with his hysterical physical comedy. The scene where we hear her sing for the first time is a comic highlight of the year. She's blissfully oblivious to her lack of talent and decides to play Carnegie Hall. Thus spins the conflict that anchors the plot. Yes, her singing is astonishingly bad, but director Stephen Freer's loving approach elevates the film above a one-joke song."" ]"
sully;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Those expecting a tense \""disaster flick\"" re-creation of the “Miracle on the Hudson” may be disappointed. This film is more about the investigation into Captain “Sully” Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) after he saved 155 people by landing his plane on the river. The structure alternates between his struggles with the sudden attention, the inquiry itself and the fateful flight. The flight is staged several times in a very rational manner, never wildly tense but more procedural (not surprising considering director straightforward Clint Eastwood's style). However, the visual effects are stunningly real. While the behind-the-scenes story is fascinating and Hanks maintains his steely resolve, this is more an examination than an experience. NOTE: Sit thru the credits for footage of the real crew/passenger reunion."" ]"
hell-or-high-water;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""When the movie starts, you assume that the brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) are just out for a bank-robbing joy ride thru the forlorn, foreclosed Texas midlands. As the plot develops, it becomes clear that there's more to their plan. While they go from bank to bank, the sheriff (Jeff Bridges in a crotchety comic role) pursues them with quiet patience and logic. This is NOT a wildly-violent crime caper or a Tarantinoesque script with snappy repartee. It's a smartly-written, well-directed drama with involving characters and exceptional performances all around. A clean action film with that's intelligently crafted to rise above the genre."" ]"
bad-moms;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Mila Kunis stars as an overworked, underappreciated mom who decides she's had enough of the constant pressure to be perfect. She makes 2 friends (Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn, who creates the movie's most enjoyable character) and they set out to make the title come true. This is the ultimate chick flick. The audience was almost exclusively women and they were loving it. The script crammed full of F-bombs and wacky acts, much of them funny. As is the fate of many modern movies, it sometimes tries too hard to be outrageous. The mom message gets a bit heavy-handed, but there are moments of genuine sweetness that adds to the appeal. Fun for moms and highly relatable with its amusing approach."" ]"

While the kids are all intellectually accomplished and physically trained, their encounters with civilization (and their mother's relatives) prove challenging. This unique story is filled with moments that are charming and captivating, thanks partly to the sweet, sensitive performances of the children (and Mortensen, of course). There may be scenes that strain credibility, but the way the story is told provides a fascinating and ultimately engaging look at a very special family."" ]"

There are parallel stories about his relationships with several slaves and a flash forward to a racially-charged court battle in the 20th century. A lot's going on and even with the deliberate pace, it manages to maintain interest. Writer/director Gary Ross has purposely let this sprawling story take place slowly and took advantage of McConaughey's star power with lots of lingering close-ups. The cast is strong and that helps, but this film is dramatic, solemn and noble…a mighty effort to make important cinema…and it somewhat succeeds. Plus, it's based on a remarkable true story, which makes it more interesting."" ]"

Her immense affection for music leads her to perform in a private club that puts up with her off-tune screeching because of her money. When she decides to go public, a number of sycophants rally around her, while her husband tries desperately to shield her from reality. Although this is billed as a comedy (and it does have humorous elements, esp. when she sings), it's really a gentle drama about a disillusioned woman, played with touching grace by Catherine Frot. The film could lose about 15 minutes and not miss anything, but it's still sweetly told with lovely period style."" ]"
the-nice-guys;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Ryan Gosling plays a struggling private eye in 70s LA, who teams up with an enforcer (Russell Crowe) to solve a complicated case. While the dialogue is sometimes fun and the action is capable, it's Gosling's physical flair and comic timing that's the film's best asset (this would be no surprise if you saw him on \""SNL\""). He and Crowe have decent chemistry, but it's young Angourie Rice (as the adept daughter) who adds character appeal. While the dialogue is uneven and the momentum falters, it's an enjoyable attempt at a quirky buddy comedy (writer/director Shane Black is best known for his involvement with the \""Lethal Weapon\"" series)."" ]"
green-room;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Jeremy Saulnier's debut writing/directing effort was BLUE RUIN (which I gave 5 stars). This one continues to exhibit his ability to craft an original approach to dark suspense. Anton Yelchin plays a member of a touring punk band.  He ends up witnessing something bad backstage after a gig at a gathering place for neo-Nazis. The group is first confused, then terrorized as the club's owner (Patrick Stewart) tries to deal with their inconvenient presence. Even before things go horribly wrong, the characters are compelling and the sense of dread starts to creeps in. While not resorting to expected results (or excessively explicit  violence), the tension builds steadily. It's not as original as his original film, but it still effectively maintains suspense and ups his promise as a new master of the genre."" ]"

Her attitude changes after her mother dies and she falls for the hot new (much younger) man at work (Max Greenfield). This is really a vehicle for is Field, who is sweet and funny in her wonderful, wacky ensembles of vintage clothes. There's lots to like in her character's spunky attitude and enthusiasm for life. Being embraced by a hip New York crowd may be pushing reality, but she manages to pull it off. Greenfield is charming and the supporting cast adds some spice. Even though it sometimes tries a bit too hard to be eccentric and clever, the pace is lively and the writing is humorous. Still, it's Field's engaging performance that makes the film so appealing."" ]"

Shannon portrays The King as a sincere, misunderstood and misguided character, while it's Spacey who gets to satirize the President with hilarious results. The run-up to the encounter unfolds effectively, but isn't especially funny. Actually, other than Spacey, there aren't a lot of laffs. It's more about quiet humor than big comedy. Still, this fictionalized version of what happened is fun to watch"" ]"

This is framed around tense discussions among government leaders about the political issues of collateral damage. Meanwhile, in Nevada, the remote pilot (Aaron Paul) is tasked with firing the actual bomb and risking the lives of innocents. While the debate and consequential dilemmas are compelling, there's not much on-the-ground action. This is mostly carried out from remote locations, rendering the film more a moral/political debate with real-life consequences. The performances and tight editing help make this predominately intellectual interchange an absorbing experience."" ]"

There's a constant sense of ominous portent, potential danger and unknown consequences. And the final payoff is pretty cool. The cast does a good job of taking matters seriously and the special effects are simple, yet convincing. This is a low-budget sci-fi thriller than poses more questions than it answers. Still, there's enough mystery and tension to make for a compelling experience. Not really sure why the title (based on the song) is relevant."" ]"

Their mission was to rescue 32 men who were stranded on a tanker that had literally split apart in the rough seas. The action alternates between the harrowing ride to the rescue (helmed by Chris Pine, playing a determined introvert) and the attempts to stay afloat by the tanker’s crew (led by an equally underplayed Casey Affleck). Toss in a heartfelt romance and you have all the ingredients of a classic adventure. The perilous challenge of the pummeling waves makes for formidable visuals, even though the obviously CGI source lacks a realistic edge. The personal encounters are clichéd and not especially compelling. It’s well made and sometimes bracing, but there’s an earnest formulaic feel that keeps it from being as involving as it might have been."" ]"

The host/capturer (John Goodman, who's wonderfully creepy but still charming) tells her that the world above has been destroyed. She and the 3rd resident (John Gallagher Jr) struggle to cope with their new reality. First-time director Dan Trachtenberg knows how to manipulate the action with dynamic images (and snappy editing by Stefan Grube). He also provides plenty of ominous worry (with a slight mid-point slow-down). It's completely compelling and has just enough twists to keep it captivating and occasionally frightening.

Both women superbly capture their characters: Blanchett is seductively alluring and richly conflicted, while Mara displays an innocence and longing that’s rich yet subtle. Director Todd Haynes has beautifully crafted a period world, while masterfully capturing the longing and frustration of their relationship. The entire mood is genteel and subdued, but the film is thoroughly compelling."" ]"

Director Adam McKay has utilized several cinematic tools to tell a complex and confusing story: entertaining montages, snappy editing, short scenes and clever comedy. He examines how the sub-prime mortgage crisis brought our country (and the world) to the brink of financial disaster and how a small group of smart investors managed to make big money on it. The short-attention-span pacing and McKay's wildly creative approach (with those absorbing performances) make the film entertaining and ultimately infuriating."" ]"

Their villian-fighting good becomes controversial because of the collateral damage left by their epic battles. As a result, the world votes to regulate their services, which causes a split in the ranks: some agreeing with the new controls, others resisting. Ultimately, a dozen Marvel universe superheroes duke it out, using their assorted powers to keep it interesting. At 146 minutes, it's too long: the dialogue often drags and every action scene (although edited with dizzying velocity) runs longer than necessary. In its favor are some expectedly neat special effects and a likeable cast. Each member gets to create a few moments of character (esp. the new Spidey delightfully played by Tom Holland). This movie crams a relatively simple story with too much clutter (vs. the cool simplicity of \""Deadpool\""). Fans of the genre will find plenty to like, but in the big picture (pun intended) this blends into the formula."" ]"

After her initial bout with homesickness, she blossoms, thanks to the devoted attention of a young man (Emory Cohen with quietly captivating charm and more than a hint of young Brando's essence). A return trip home complicates her life. It's a sentimental story with lots of tears and sweet moments. Some enjoyable supporting characters (esp. bossy landlady Julie Walters) add a lively touch. The period settings are attractively created and the fashions are lovely. It's deliberately paced and a bit too long, but it comes together in a gently compelling drama."" ]"

It's set in 1912, when the movement for women's right to vote was reaching a tipping point in London. Carey Mulligan suppresses her signature sweet smile to play a beleaguered working class woman who’s drawn into the fight to become an activist. The movie creates a bleak time with earnest detail, although the cinematography is sometimes muddy and the thick accents occasionally hinder comprehension.

Like most movies about social injustice, there's plenty of outrage at their plight (albeit mild in this case) and the inevitable brave stands required by others (again, lacking fervor). Moore keeps a lid on her portrayal, letting Page be the sweet center of this movie. Her performance is truly touching. The film unfolds effectively (although it could have ended earlier), but the direction is rather bland.

Not only are they gorgeous, but look completely realistic. On the other hand, the creatures have a more stylistic cartoon look, which is a bit of a mismatch. This is also the darkest film in the studio's history (lots of danger and death) and it rambles into weird territory (literally and figuratively). Despite its flaws, it still manages to some sweet characters and a gentle lesson.

Unlike what you might expect from Hollywood, there's not one chase scene or shootout, only an intelligently-written narrative of human conflict and determined accomplishment.

Their most famous story was about child abuse by Catholic priests and the cover-up by the church. This team (led by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo & Rachel McAdams) tenaciously researches and interviews, as they gradually uncover the explosive truth. Even though this is basically a press procedural, the performances are earnest and the writing is rigorous. The tightly-paced drama is in their diligent efforts and intense concern. Director/co-writer Thomas McCarthy (along with Josh Singer) has resisted making the church into threatening villains and overloading the film with emotional confessions, which makes it more a fascinating academic exercise than a moving drama."" ]"

Highwire walker Philippe Petit (appealing portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) narrates his story on camera with flashbacks that recreate his effort to walk on a wire between the World Trade Center towers. His tenacious resolve is recounted with considerable detail, but without much dramatic involvement. However, once he starts his incredible feat, the movie becomes riveting.

This intelligently-written film unfolds the complex narrative by withholding information, reflecting the agent's own confused state. The style of director Denis Villeneuve  sometimes calls attention to itself with atypical camera placement, but he also makes uncommon choices that heighten the drama. Blunt effectively pulls off the mix of tough confidence and vulnerable bafflement.

Wilson effectively plays a regular guy (and sweet father), who fights back without becoming an action hero. Director John Erick Dowdle has managed to keep each encounter and every chase tightly wound, although he and his brother (Drew) have forced the script's logic into some pretty tight corners. If you're willing to accept the highly improbable situations that keep piling up, you're in for a tense and often riveting ride."" ]"

Eisenberg plays the role of eager, besotted listener with his typical hesitant confidence. Even though this is primarily a duo dialogue, the skillful screenplay by Donald Margulies and controlled direction by James Ponsoldt help make every moment enthralling.

He and his best friend (RJ Cyler) also make parodies of great films, a subplot that provides some witty cinema in-jokes (stay thru the credits for a complete list of titles). The film's eccentric humor is often clever and fun, although it sometimes try too hard. Once the story hits rocky ground, things quickly fall into emotional drama.

This group and their rapid-fire reactions drive the movie and the comedy. When things get bleak, the trip turns peculiar and the story loses steam. The visuals are colorful, but not as dazzling as we've come to expect from Pixar. This creative slant on growing up and the complexity of feelings is an ambitious subject. While it's energetic, fun and sweet, it's emotional impact failed to connect with me. NOTE: Stay thru the early credits to enjoy the cleverest moments in the film."" ]"
san-andreas;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""America's most famous fault finally gives way…all the way from LA to San Francisco. Dwayne Johnson essentially becomes a super hero, setting out to rescue his wife and daughter from the increasingly intense catastrophe. Starting with the harrowing car wreck that opens the film, the devastation and derring-do get more and more amazing. The obstacles build, while the circumstances escalate with solid action and staggering effects. The human story at the center never gets in the way of the eye-popping destruction. Watching what cleverly-designed complication comes next adds to the fun. Grab your popcorn and hold on! This is the most spectacular disaster flick in years."" ]"
cinderella;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Disney has created a lush, but somewhat lackluster live action version of the classic fairy tale. Lily James glows with kindness and beauty in the title role, while Richard Madden make a dashing Prince Charming. Cate Blanchett brings old world elegance as the stepmother without adding much evil charm. Director Kenneth Branagh has emphasized the earnest emotional content, but it's really the visuals where this film shines: Dante Ferretti's art direction and Sandy Powell's exceptional costumes are simply gorgeous. There's not a lot of personality or comic relief in the cast, but the sincerity of the performances keeps it involving. NOTE: The animated short before the feature is a new song from the \""Frozen\"" sisters."" ]"
good-kill;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Most of this film takes place in a metal box on an air base in Las Vegas, where \""pilots\"" fly drone bombing missions over the Middle East. The other scenes follow Ethan Hawke with his wife (January Jones), as he tries to rectify his work and maintain his marriage. The tactical scenes are both compelling and unsettling, while the personal moments could have used more dramatic punch. In addition, the commanding officer (Bruce Greenwood) is asked rather transparently by the script to continuously supply the debate points surrounding this controversial procedure. While it effectively raises some contentious arguments on both sides, the film would have had more punch with a more potent emotional parallel."" ]"
pitch-perfect-2;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""After an opening number setback, the Bellas re-group to win an international competition. Every character gets a few quick story beats with Anna Kendrick as the leader and Hailee Steinfeld as the new member.

This film shows her at several public appearances, interacting with her husband and shopping for more clothes and accessories. Adding to the aging-defying stereotype is the director, legendary documentarian Albert Maysles, who's 87 himself. There's a hint of biographical background and a few other people peripherally involved, but the camera focuses primarily on Iris.

After a sluggish start, this one slams on the accelerator and speeds thru one outrageous sequence after another. Forget the laws of physics, the viability of human endurance, even common sense…this film is all about stunts that are hilariously over the top. Don’t worry about plot or dialogue and enjoy the macho posturing.

One endearing misfit (Jim Parsons) causes a calamity and teams up with a lost girl (Rihanna) to find her mom. This colorful animation starts with a fast-paced first hour: lots of eye candy and quick comedy. Once the inevitable emotion kicks in, the pace slows and the action is accompanied by tender songs.

After a taut, well-edited chase, the action takes on a cautiously apprehensive quality as the hunt becomes more intense. Expect to lose a portion of the dialogue (and subsequent plot) due to the thick Irish accents, but it doesn't interfere from appreciating most the action. While it's not riveting, there's a solid pace and forceful momentum that holds your attention."" ]"

Even though the situation's unique, not a lot about the story is original. Annette Bening provides a charming romantic flirtation and the granddaughter is delightful. It moves along with enuff pluck to occasionally amuse and gradually work its way into our hearts. One of the best things is the soundtrack, which is full of Lennon's wonderful songs. A sweetly charming addition to Pacino's resume."" ]"

Charmed by the younger couple's free-spirited approach to life, the 40-somethings develop a fast friendship and forsake the trappings of their mature mindset. Just when this film's age premise starts to wear thin, the relationships develop deeper implications. Stiller ably handles the humor in his character's dilemmas, but it's Driver quirky personality that charms the screen. Writer/director Noah Baumbach has created a sharply-observed satire on the generation gap that provides more chuckles than laffs. Still, this perceptive parody is fun.

The film is almost exclusively this duo in general conversation and intellectual discussion about the play, as they travel from a retrospective event in Zurich to a remote house in the Alps (surrounded by gorgeous scenery). With any lesser actors, this could be a tedious bore. With these two, it's always interesting, even though it's still lots of talk.

Sixty years later, she hires a young lawyer (Ryan Reynolds) to help her reclaim it, including the most famous painting, Gustav Klimt's \""The Lady in Gold.\"" All the fundamentals of a prestige film are here: a cast with chops, a noble cause, insurmountable odds and a troubled history (which alternates with the modern crusade). It has the potential and the outward traits of a stirring drama, but the writing is flat, the relationships are uninteresting and the emotion never hits home. While the story is appealing, the movie doesn't live up to the quality potential."" ]"

She plays an accomplished linguistics professor, who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. Needless to say, with a subject like this the journey is intense and it focuses closely on Moore's slow struggle to maintain her mind and retain the relationships with her husband (Alec Baldwin) and 3 children. The supporting cast is strong and the directing duo has fashioned a sensitive story. It does occasionally feel the need to provide us factual information about the disease, but mainly stays on course with many downer moments and lots of tears. This is not a great film, but it is a great performance."" ]"
selma;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""The 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery was a turning point in the fight for equal voting rights. This film examines the event from historical and personal perspectives. David Oyelowo remarkably inhabits the role of Martin Luther King, Jr., as he leads the campaign, while facing his own doubts and demons. The performances are universally compelling and director Ava DuVernay has masterfully crafted an authoritative work of cinema. Bradford Young's beautiful, intimate cinematography adds to the film's artistic appeal. Almost every encounter and speech could have been shorter, which would have helped build more dramatic tension, but this remains an important, ambitious historical drama."" ]"
mr-turner;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Although this biopic is about British painter J.M.W. Turner, it's more about his peculiar personality and unconventional life than his art. He spends lots of time observing nature and painting it, but he also visits important patrons, storms thru the Royal Academy and has time to sexually use one woman and fall for another. Timothy Spall gives a bravura performance in the title role, gruffly grunting his way thru all of his encounters. It's a fascinating portrait with plenty of eccentric supporting characters (as is common with director Mike Leigh). Cinematographer Dick Pope has infused every shot, including the lovely landscapes, with a soft palette and lustrous glow. At 150 minutes, I was rooting for him to die before it was over, but other than the extended length, the film presents a fascinating portrayal of an important artist."" ]"
big-eyes;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""In the early 60s, Keane paintings of pitiful waifs were all the rage. Turns out that Margaret (Amy Adams) painted them, but her charismatic husband (Christoph Waltz) took the credit. He also revolutionized the commercialization of popular art. Their first happy, then tumultuous marriage takes a repetitive long time to get to the courtroom showdown, which also goes on too long. Adams turns this halting, insecure character into a nuanced and compelling performance. Director Tim Burton minimized the bizarre flourishes expected from his work, to tell a straightforward narrative. While it's a fascinating story and Adams is worth the ticket, the film feels more like an informative historical replay, than a moving personal drama. NOTE: Look for the real Margaret in a conspicious cameo on a park bench behind Adam's easel in an early scene."" ]"
top-five;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Chris Rock wrote/directed/stars in this examination of a popular movie comic who attempts to restructure his career as a serious director. The film is structured around a discussion/interview with a New York Times reporter (Rosario Dawson), as he goes thru the day promoting his film's opening (and runs into a variety of entertaining cameos). Most of the comedy comes from Rock's signature irreverent insights, even when they come out of the other actors' mouths. Much of it is amusing and sometimes funny. Rock's performance and his direction have a robust energy, but the film is more a small personal project than a riotous big-screen comedy."" ]"

into-the-woods;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""This movie of Stephen Sondheim's musical mashes up the plots and characters from several fairy tales into a wonderfully amusing and dark entertainment (although a little more Disneyfied and less dark than the original). The cast is in great voice, but their performances (and the ability to clearly hear the brilliantly clever lyrics) make it a delight. Meryl Streep brings her authenticity to nuanced and touching brilliance as the Witch and Chris Pine's arrogant prince reveals his comic charms better than \""Horrible Bosses 2\"" does. Director Rob Marshall successfully shortened it. He keeps it grounded in the humor and humanity, without resorting to dazzling cinematic tricks. Lovers of the stage show will be pleased with this spirited and smart adaptation. Note to parents: even though it's not lascivious or violent, this is not a typical fairy tale family film."" ]"
horrible-bosses-2;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Charlie Day, Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis are back to launch their own business. When they get screwed (by Christoph Waltz), they hatch a plan to kidnap his son (Chris Pine). The leading trio still has great comic chemistry and their non-stop banter provides most of the laughs. Jennifer Aniston provides some outrageous moments and Jamie Foxx gets in a few, but the plot and supporting roles take a back seat to the quick-witted leads. It feels like an opportunity for them to go on an extended improvisation, but the brisk pacing keeps it from ever feeling self-indulgent."" ]"
foxcatcher;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This is one of those dramas where everybody pulls out their best acting chops and in this case, it paid off. Channing Tatum plays an solemn Olympic wrestler, who's solicited to train with eccentric, rich John du Pont (Steve Carell). Mark Ruffalo is the older brother, whose relationship is crucial. Carell not only appended the giant schnoz to transform his look, he also assumed a halting, dark demeanor that's both compelling and creepy. Ruffalo turns in an expected involving performance and Tatum's jumped to a new level with his physical and emotional transformation: touchingly tough and sweet. The story moves at a deliberate pace and could get tedious if it weren't for the riveting performances and astounding story (which is based on fact)."" ]"
mad-max-fury-road;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""Director George Miller has returned to the character that made him famous 36 years ago. The landscape is bleaker and the action is more pumped. Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron play rebels who are trying to escape the evil overlords, or at least outrun them, but forget story and dialogue: This is all about spectacular stunts, incredible art direction and furious action. The relentless pace and virtually non-stop clashes are sometimes so hectic that it's hard to figure out what's happening. The thick accents and noisy sound sometime make the dialogue a challenge, but it doesn't really matter. The massive soundtrack by Junkie XL adds another level of intensity. This film is inventive in the extreme and dizzying in it's bravura direction."" ]"

Jon Stewart wrote/directed this film featuring Gael García Bernal and he did a pretty good job. The basic structure is solid and there are creative touches that show a sound understanding of the medium. It's an effectively told story, but lacks the emotional punch that would have given the days in solitary more impact. Still, it's an interesting story and a promising first effort that includes an earnest message about the freedom of speech and plight of political prisoners."" ]"

Those traits still reveal themselves in his remarkable portrayal of Stephen Hawking. The film starts when he was a promising Cambridge student, where he meets the woman who became his wife (Felicity Jones, who's also wonderful). Even though he was diagnosed with ALS at age 21, they continued their relationship, as he went on to become the famous physicist. Throughout the dramatic challenges of their life, the screenplay manages to inject humor and hope. Redmayne transforms himself into an Oscar-worthy performance and the film tells Hawking's story with warmth and honor."" ]"
whiplash;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Miles Teller plays a student jazz drummer whose ambition drives him to extremes, while he endures the abusive tactics of a teacher/band leader (J.K. Simmons). Much like director Damien Chazelle's extensive use of close-ups, this film focuses intensely on the personal dramatic conflict. Fortunately, Teller and Simmons create potent characters. The pace never lags, but the grueling encounters (and Simmons' character) sometimes push beyond reality. Still, it's a compelling character study."" ]"
big-hero-6;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""One of Disney's great animation traditions is to show a short before the feature. \""Feast\"" is a delightful look at a hungry puppy. Then comes the main event, an energetic and non-stop action adventure that follows a young man (Hiro) and his large, soft robot Baymax. They team up with a group of inventor nerds to form a super group that tackles a villain with a cool weapon. The pace is lively and the characters are interesting, but only one (voiced by T.J. Miller) provides any comedy. Most of that is left to Baymax's sweet size and lovable attitude. The visuals are bright, beautiful and dazzling, as Disney does best. Fun for kids and adults. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for one of the best cameo gags ever!"" ]"

Franco (creating one of his most delightfully funny characters ever) plays a tabloid TV host who travels to North Korea with his producer (Rogen) to interview Kim Jong-un. This is the type of madcap mayhem they do so well: lots of dick/ass gags, wacky interplay, outrageous stunts and homoerotic slants. The energy never slacks and the laffs are constant. If you like screwball comedy (with a definite juvenile sensibility), you'll be very entertained."" ]"

Director Peter Jackson is a master storyteller, able to deftly weave massive spectacle with moments of personal sentiment. Martin Freeman (in the title role) charms with his whimsical personality. The fantasy world is visually dazzling and the pacing seldom lags, although the battles and the concluding drama go on too long. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll be thrilled with this grand finale."" ]"
get-on-up;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Chadwick Boseman is dynamite in this biopic of James Brown. He's got the moves and the style, while creating a character who's convincingly arrogant and occasionally touching. The story unfolds in a non-linear structure that expects the audience to know some aspects of Brown's life, but that keeps it interesting. Even with the no-holds-barred depiction of his flaws, all of his hits are performed (with the real Brown's vocals) to make the experience a super-funky groove. The Godfather of Soul's genius is fully on display (especially on stage), but this film does a good job of detailing the emotional complexity of the man. Viola Davis, as his mother, is wonderful as always."" ]"
the-wind-rises;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Considered by many to be the world's greatest animator, Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Secret World of Arrietty) claims this is his final film. He's moved away from the usual fantastical subject matter to a biography based on the designer of Japan's most lethal fighter planes. The story begins with him as a young boy, whose lyrical dreams depict his obsession with flying. When it follows his plane designer career, the story is interesting. There is a tragic subplot about the love of his life, which slows down the pacing. Thru it all are Miyazaki's sumptuous visuals: the subtle observations, the stunning landscapes, the exquisite design. Despite the simplistic script (voiced by an impressive list of American actors) and the +2hr length, this film offers a dazzling look at an innovative and magical master at work."" ]"

Director David Fincher has crafted a smart & slyly suspenseful investigation into love and deception on any number of levels."" ]"

Considering the subject and the writer/director (John Carney, who did the same for \""Once\"") you can expect lots of music. The soundtrack is filled with pleasant poppy songs, none of which are memorable. Ruffalo is interesting as always and Knightley may be the most charming she's ever been. Adam Levine co-stars as her ex and does fine as an actor (of course, he sings). The situations are predictable and the dialogue isn't especially sharp, but the appealing actors and plentiful music make it likeable."" ]"

John Leguizamo joins the trip to add some enjoyable spice. The first half spends too much time with Favreau's character blustering and **** but once he hits the road, the story takes on a sweet charm. This is the kind of small personal film that started Favreau's career (before he became director of blockbusters like \""Iron Man\"") and it's a welcome return to a heart-felt, charming little gem. The music's great fun too. NOTE: Stay thru the credits to see the real chef giving Favreau some technique tips."" ]"

A group of genetically evolved apes leads a peaceful existence until a band of human survivors appears. This film spends more time in the ape world than it does with humans, which, considering the technology, makes it a mostly-animated film. Although there are a few moments of action, it's primarily a political drama. All that being said, they've managed to craft a compelling story and create a pretty convincing world. The storytelling can get a bit heavy handed and predictable, but it's still an effective adventure."" ]"

The story is as aimless as their lives. There's no real structure, just scenes of wasted (literally) youth. The only major adult character is Franco who plays an inappropriate coach,  Even with though it feels like an MTV reality show, the young actors impressively create natural and complex characters and director Gia Coppola has an ability (like her aunt Sophia) to capture quiet observations and create compelling situations. Look for Jack's dad Val and Gia's great aunt Talia Shire (as the guidance counselor) in cameos."" ]"

His new wife (Nicole Kidman) discovers that his torturer is still alive, so he sets out for revenge. The mood of this film starts somber and gets more dismal from there. The story alternates between his despondent present and his awful past, while most of the intensity comes from the prison camp (naturally). Performances are all around strong and the story is compelling, but the film fails to pack an emotional wallop."" ]"
blue-ruin;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""A seemingly homeless man (Arlington native Macon Blair in a touching, nuanced performance) sets out for a revenge that grows out of control. Comparisons to early Coen Brothers are inevitable: a sly objective point of view, careful pacing, interesting observations, understated emotion and abrupt violence. Jeremy Saulnier (also an Arlington native), who wrote/directed/shot shows a mature mastery of style and cinematic confidence that augers well for his future (especially after the mess that was \""Murder Party\"").

muppets-most-wanted;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The Muppets get a new manager (Ricky Gervais) who promises them success in Europe, but is really out to stage a massive heist (along with a Kermit imposter). The plot is just an excuse for each character to do its bit and to allow a few famous people to pop up for cameos. The human stars, including Tina Fey & Ty Burrell, are working hard to be funny, but don't generate lots of laffs. There are plenty of fun moments and some cute, catchy tunes by Bret McKenzie, but the script isn't that sassy. While the movie is energetic and entertaining, it falls short of being as funny as it could. NOTE: There's a zany short from the \""Monsters\"" franchise before the feature."" ]"

This is one of those roles that gives a classy actor a chance to play against type and Law approaches it with gusto: cussing, ranting and violently attacking every one and every scene. While it's fun to watch (and sometimes too much), the character doesn't draw much sympathy until it's almost over. The writing and direction are solid without elevating the film to exceptional, but Law's energy makes it worthwhile."" ]"

Don't expect any of the horror or bloody tropes, these are accomplished intellectuals who get their blood from antiseptic sources. Guess I should mention that it was written/directed by Jim Jarmusch (Ghost Dog, Mystery Train, Down by Law) who brings his low-key, off-kilter skills to the film. It's attractively shot, a somewhat fascinating approach and features Swinton, who's always wonderful. On the other hand, it moves at a snails pace and spends a lot of time in anemic ruminations. Unique but tedious."" ]"
locke;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The entire movie focuses on Tom Hardy, driving on a journey that affects his career, marriage and life in permanent and ruinous ways. The artistic cinematography and active editing keeps the limited setting from being a hindrance, but it's Hardy's controlled performance that makes the film work. On the down side, even when the situation gets more acute, the emotion never escalates. Sure, he cries a bit, but the intensity starts out and continues at a constant rate. Instead of being an involving drama, this is more a compelling character study and cinematic curiosity."" ]"

The poor huddled masses at the back (led by Chris Evans) decide to plead their case to the leader, so they undertake a mission to get to the front. At times it seems like an action film, but the fight scenes are often full of splashed blood and blurred action. At other times, it's an apocalyptic drama with bold statements about class and society. If you're willing to overlook the giant lapses in logic, you may find this movie to be an absorbing and original experience. BTW, Tilda Swinton is having great fun with her bespeckled, toothy character."" ]"

When he happens upon a scheme to collapse our economy, he's sent to Moscow to stop it. Needless to say, chases and violent encounters ensue. Chris Pine has moved into the lead and he's an assured, solid action hero. Even though the plot has no surprises, director Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the bad guy) has crafted a taut little mission. Unfortunately, the blurry camerawork obscures much of the action. The attractive Russian locations (inside and out) are a bonus and the movie's momentum makes it entertaining. NOTE: Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov has a cameo."" ]"

Ralph Fiennes heads up the cast of zany eccentrics as the concierge of the titular establishment. He includes the new Lobby Boy on his escapades, which include stealing a painting, escaping from prison and eluding the invading forces. Visually, this is a symmetrical delight: the locations are gorgeous and the detail is exquisite. The deadpan dialogue and comical staging keeps the pacing on its toes.

After interviews and research he sets out to create his own version of one of Vermeer's classics by working from a real environment.

About 10 minutes is devoted to the actual deluge and it's pretty cool. Much of the rest of the time is all about drama and family conflict. Darren Aronofsky (\""Black Swan\"") is known for his singular, dark vision and it's manifest in this imaginative adaptation (the evolution of Earth and the montage of violence are standout moments). Like so many epics these days, this one could lose about 30 minutes and be a more compelling film. As it stands, it's a moderately involving drama that puts a pretty unique spin on the Bible story."" ]"

Four Navy SEALs set out to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan, but the mission goes horribly wrong. The film takes some time to set up, but once the action kicks in, it's a gripping ordeal (especially those remarkable tumbles down the rocks). Director Peter Berg has crammed the skirmishes with confusion, astounding kills and high-tension pacing. These are some of the best battles in recent filmmaking. The cast is strong (in both senses of the word), while miming moments of emotion. A brutal, well-crafted and stirring tribute."" ]"
philomena;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Judi Dench plays the slightly spunky and entirely endearing title character: a women who searches for the son she lost to adoption when she was a teen. Steve Coogan tamps down his comic side, as the career-challenged journalist who helps her on her quest. It sounds like one of those dramas that could deteriorate into sentimentality, but under the assured direction of Stephen Frears it maintains integrity and heart. This true tale has enough turns to keep it interesting and Dench creates a character whose quiet demeanor reveals an appealing and confident woman. The narrative takes a little time to develop momentum, but by the end you'll be captivated by this sweet character and her engaging story."" ]"

As he so brilliantly showed in his last film (\""A Separation\""), director Asghar Farhadi has the ability to imbue even the most mundane moments with significance. As the conflicts develop, he elicits compelling performances from his entire cast (including the moving young Elyes Aguis). This is an intelligent writer/director: he lets the story unfold in small bits and never resorts to histrionics. There's no music or any other technique to manipulate the audience, just solid filmmaking and an absorbing drama. (In French with subtitles.)"" ]"
mandela-long-walk-to-freedom;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The title pretty much sums it up: a walk with Nelson from rural boyhood to his election as South Africa's first democratically-elected president. Much of the journey is taken up with his early fight against apartheid and the subsequent 22 years in jail. To anyone who hasn't read the autobiography on which the film is based, this will provide interesting details about his personal life and political struggles. Although Idris Elba (Mandela) and Naomie Harris (his wife Winnie) both create rich characters and the narrative is compelling, the whole thing lacks emotional power. The prison years are the most absorbing. It should take 2+ hours to chronicle a great man's life, but it feels too long and sometimes too simplistic. Still, an informative history lesson."" ]"

He's been trying for 20 years to obtain the rights and she's staunchly determined not to give in. Playing parallel to this charming story is an emotional examination of her life as a girl and the flawed father she worshiped (Colin Farrell in an uncharacteristic sweet role). The team's frustrating attempts at winning the writer's approval are classic Disney magic: cheerful, earnest and genuinely funny. The childhood flashbacks, although beautifully shot, simply go on too long and drag down the pacing (and the light mood). Even so, adults will enjoy this tasteful and well-crafted glimpse into cinema history with an emotional core. Be sure to sit thru the credits til the \""tape\"" runs out."" ]"

This isn't just about their seminal relationships (and Ginsberg's sexual awakening), but about the lethal act that caused a major fissure in their lives. Radcliffe does an impressive job, but all of the performances and the spirited pacing keep this freewheeling story interesting. While it's not a great film, it's the best I've seen on this subject and a cursory, yet fascinating glimpse into some complex relationships."" ]"

The transactions are complicated by a mouthy wife (Jennifer Lawrence) and an earnest politician (Jeremy Renner). Despite how complicated it sounds, this film is really about the characters and the brilliant actors who made the bold choices. Every actor has created memorable, enjoyable individuals and their performances are potent (Lawrence is once again a revelation). Co-writer/director David O.

This film has some of the Coen Brothers hallmark traits: interesting characters (and some hilarious ones), deadpan humor, as well as intelligent approaches to plot, situations and people. The songs are given extended play (with the actors singing live) and actors are all excellent. While this film is richly observed and enjoyable, it's a bit slight by Coen Brothers standards."" ]"

Since it's directed by Bill Condon you can expect exceptional performances all around. Cumberbatch's creation of Assange is compelling and totally believable.

There's a liberal sprinkling of in jokes and snappy grown-up references. The visual style is cluttered, none of the characters are particularly memorable and the many chases are lively but unfocused. The pacing starts to lag near the end. Still, the sometimes creative visuals and overall energetic approach should please eager young viewers, giving fans of the form plenty to play with."" ]"

McConaughey imbues his character with much of the swagger typical of his personality, but manages to show emotion once or twice. It's Leto who completely transforms himself into a sweet, sensitive woman and creates the film's most poignant peaks. The movie is a bit too long and repetitive in the setbacks, but it still manages to tell the story effectively with award-potential performances."" ]"

When he’s put into a super-security, supercool facility, he teams up with fellow inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger to make his break. The brain-teaser plot pushes credibility, but it still unravels without ever getting dumb or dull. The action is mostly average with a few moments of flash. You don’t go to a movie with these two expecting great drama or deep meaning, just some macho fun and a few laffs. It's enjoyable popcorn escapism, literally."" ]"

What stands out most is the animation: simply beautiful ice and snow design, lovely lighting and wonderful inventiveness. The story is romantic and adult, but the pace, visuals and personality may help it appeal to kids. There's a clever opening short featuring an early Mickey Mouse AND one last gag after the credits."" ]"

Johnny Knoxville disguises himself as 86-year-old Irving Zisman and takes a road trip with his 8-year-old grandson (Jackson Nicholl, who's already an amazingly confident and gifted comic presence). They play out the simple narrative in real places with real people getting involved and reacting to the outrageous things that Zisman does. The laffs are plentiful, as long as you're amused by gross bodily functions, genital humor and irreverent situations. Despite the craziness, Knoxville's talent as an actor adds realism and emotion to this expedition in crazy excess. Think Jackass meets Candid Camera."" ]"

A few rock stars (Springsteen, Jagger, Sting) offer their comments. It's fascinating to learn about the history and influence of these amazing vocalists. It's fun to hear them riff effortlessly and reminisce about the past. When the focus turns to their failed attempts at moving to the front of the stage, the energy turns dark and drags on too long.

Along the way, they encounter Helen Mirren, Catherine Zeta-Jones & Anthony Hopkins. Watching this A-list cast fight and kill with efficient aplomb is the biggest draw. The action sequences are plentiful and entertaining, while the humor comes more from attitude than lines (and Malkovich's funny faces). This is an old-fashioned spy flick.

2-guns;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Mark Wahlberg & Denzel Washington are undercover agents playing each other, until they both get double-crossed and have to work together. While the plot is typical, there are enough variations to keep it interesting. The chases and fights are competent without being exceptional. What makes a film like this work is the chemistry between the leads and these guys got it! The snappy banter helps a lot (this may be Wahlberg's best comic performance). Don't go expecting more than basic summer action fare and you'll be mindlessly entertained."" ]"
girl-most-likely;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""You might have high expectations for this film, since Kristen Wiig is the star.

After an unfortunate incident she ends up back at home in NJ with her mother (Annette Bening is a delightful turn). The film tries too hard to be one of those quirky character charmers, but it sometimes succeeds, although predictably. It's not hilarious, but sweetly amusing."" ]"

While there's a cop on the case (Jake Gyllenhaal), one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands (with some unpleasant results). This isn't really a revenge flick, as much as an often intense crime drama. The cast is uniformly excellent and much of the movie is compelling, but the 2 1/2-hour length could have used some cutting. Much of the middle simply drags on. That being said, it's a complex story that's effectively told."" ]"

Among them: the hospital where Kennedy and Oswald were rushed, Zapruder and his famous film, the travails of Oswald's family, the FBI and Secret Service in the aftermath. It blends a hand-held documentary style and hectic pacing to tell a compelling story. The large cast is peppered with notable actors, including Paul Giamatti, Zac Efron, Billy Bob Thornton and Marcia Gay Harden, and they help focus the impact. This is not a straightforward narrative, but a montage of events. Still, it proves a fascinating (and for me, informative) look behind the scenes of one of the most memorable days in 20th century America."" ]"

The intricate plot is as terrifying as it is far fetched, but the cast is chocked with strong performers that help make it work. Most of the hand-to-hand action is a blur, but the big effects are cool. After all, Roland Emmerich (:Independence Day,\"" \""2012) is directing. Mindless fun."" ]"

He's given the romantic comedy a more somber tone, shot it in classic B&W and injected some musical interludes (which he also wrote). The performances are all strong with Nathan Fillion adding in a delightful turn as Dogberry. If you enjoy the Bard, this contemporary restaging is attractive, well-crafted and entertaining."" ]"

She takes it upon herself to bring it to the stage (with the help of drama teacher, the always funny Nathan Lane). There are other supporting roles that add to the humorous momentum (notably the school administrators). This movie is as light and predictable as a TV episode and some of that could be the director, Craig Zisk, a talented veteran of the medium.

While some of the plotting and characters seem a tad overdone, the basic story is a predictable, but appealing romance. The focal character is really Dyrholm's and she gives an engaging performance (as does the rest of the cast). The lovely seaside scenery adds to the charms of this sweet summer trifle."" ]"

His turn to crime segues into part 2, when a good cop (Bradley Cooper) faces corruption on the force. Part 3 takes place 15 years later. Director Derek Cianfrance LOVES Gosling (they did the self-indulgent \""Blue Valentine\"" together). He lingers on his face in extreme closeups, while Gosling broods and emotes.

It's a mostly feel-good story about their mostly fun adventure, but the toll of racial discrimination always hovers. The script is sometimes clunky, but the performances are plucky.

This is a cross between old-school Godzilla and a variation on Transformers, but to enjoy it you must be willing to accept director Guillermo del Toro's imagination. The effects are exceptional and the action is pretty cool (although sometimes confusing). The trite attempts at character involvement only serve as padding between the battles.

The cast (including many real retired musicians) finds great fun in the lively performances by Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon and Pauline Collins.

Tobey Maguire (Carraway) is appropriately bland and the ladies are lovely. The soundtrack, a mashup of 20s period, jazz, hip hop and R&B, is outstanding right thru the credits.

Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones also turn in great performances and the entire cast is outstanding. Visually, it's attractive and full of period eloquence.

From the jarring opening image it's obvious that this is going to be heavy-handed and manipulative. The disaster is impressively imagined and their plight is certainly daunting. Even with all the pain and emotion, the frequently ominous direction and menacing music telegraphed the situations. Performances, including the 3 sons, are strong and special effects are convincing. There was something about it that left me flat. I was absorbed throughout, but never caught up in the drama. To me the 2006 HBO film \""Tsunami: The Aftermath\"" was better."" ]"

There is an occasional flash of spectacle, but the majority of the film's powerful songs are in close-ups, often one take. The intimate handheld camera adds to the intensity, but sometimes interferes when it's too jerky or causes shadows on faces. The actors run the gamut from revelatory (Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, Lucy Hale) to solid (Hugh Jackman, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter) to vocally weak (Russell Crowe). All of the singing is done live, so there's an intimate, expressive power that's distinctive. The narrative unfolds with intensity and grandeur, but this is basically opera, so it's more about emotion than logic or dialogue.

This historically-based story is told thru involving scenarios, some humor and a quietly tense escape. The characters are uniformly bland, but the hair and wardrobe were right-on 70s.

We ride along as they encounter minor and major crimes, but also watch them interact with their fellow officers and their women. This camerawork and editing have a big-budget grittiness that keeps the film rooted in reality, but doesn't get in the way. Performances are outstanding and David Ayer's directorial style has become even more sophisticated, while staying \""street.\"" A solid film with modern sensibilities."" ]"
savages;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Oliver Stone applies his distinctive directorial style to a by-the-numbers drug plot. Two men (Taylor Kitsch  & Aaron Johnson) are ying-yang partners in a pot enterprise: one is a hot-blooded vet and the other is the Buddhist business head. The only real twist: they share a girlfriend. Their lucrative business is challenged by a Mexican cartel that results in kidnapping, deception, murder and more. While there's nothing original here, Stone has given the film a muscular force that propels the action. There are a few violent or gruesome moments and some of his signature flashy flourishes, but nothing to make this film standout. The ending (which I hated) feels like it was tacked on after focus groups. But overall, it's brassy and full of fun performances."" ]"

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back and the only way to stop an Earth-threatening alien attack is for Smith to travel back in time. There, he meets the younger version of his partner (well-played by Josh Brolin) and proceeds to alter the future. Enough of plot. What we care about is cool creatures, neat effects and funny stuff. This one has plenty of it all! Some of the CG look cheesy, but there's much to enjoy, plus a touching story surprise. The most fun at the movies this summer (so far)."" ]"

It's a reality-based tale about a prissy assistant funeral director (Jack Black), who befriends a rich, mean old widow (Shirley Maclaine) and ends up killing her. The tale is told with some dialogue and lots of hilarious interviews with local residents (some of whom are real and some are actors). I'm not a Black fan, but there's none of his over-the-top antics in this quiet portrayal. Matthew McConaughey shows up in a non-glamourous role as the prosecutor. I doubt it'll be in town long because it's available on DVD 9/21/12, but it's lots of fun on any format. Stay thru the credits for additional soundbites."" ]"

The occasional laughs are provided by a teenage dude friend. Clooney's performance is one of his best and the rest of the cast is equally strong. Writer/director Alexander Payne has crafted a mature interpersonal drama set in the everyday world of Hawaii. While much of it is engaging, some of it is slow and flat."" ]"

All shot in a lush, low-angle, highly-lit version of Hollywood in the Golden Age. There's no denying that Speilberg is a master storyteller and this film has some spectacular sequences. It's also full of emotional twists and turns that left many in the cinema wiping their eyes. For me, I appreciated the craft more than I cared about the characters."" ]"

This revival of the franchise is not ironic: It gets its essence from wise-crack comedy, heartfelt emotions, numerous cameos and clever self references (including 80s nostalgia for the grown-up audience). While it's a delight to watch the old gang go at it, Segal comes off as too earnest and lacks leading man charm.

Although this device has been used many times before (most recently in \""J. Edgar\""), there's usually a clear timeline and a fleshed-out story. In this case, she's sometimes pitiful and haunted by the past. Streep turns in a complex, compelling performance and the rest of the cast is strong.

The film is visually interesting, often off kilter and intriguing on several levels, but some may find the deliberate pacing gets in the way of the film's power. Still, it's an unusual, compelling and slightly-creepy experience."" ]"
shame;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Director Steve McQueen started as a cinema artist and that shows in his commercial work. There are extended takes & minimal dialogue (hence, slow pacing) and episodes that add up to an impression (as opposed to a storyline). Michael Fassbinder plays a New York stud, who's obsessed with sex and afraid of intimacy. As a result, there two primary types of scenes: sex (including random pickups, masturbation & full-frontal nudity) and struggle (rueful staring and disaffected relationships). It's compelling on several levels, but too cerebral to be powerful. The most shameful thing is that the distributors had the conviction to release it in NC-17 (with all the attendant barriers) and it's not worth the risk."" ]"

Tom Cruise and his trimmed-down team has to run outside the system to stop a nuclear terrorist, but not before some tense and exciting sequences (especially the amazing climb outside the Burj Khalifa in Dubai). Simon Pegg adds just the right dash of humor, but it's director Brad Bird's ability to keep the accelerator to the floor that makes this film well-paced, non-stop fun."" ]"

Since this is a Clint Eastwood film, you can expect efficient storytelling and powerful performances, but this time there's an artistic flair to the period recreations and cinematography. Writer Dustin Lance Black has penned a multi-layered story that adds to the resonance.

He's hired by a wealthy old man to solve the mystery of his missing granddaughter, but discovers a series of brutal murders. Meanwhile, she's got her own problems, when she's enlisted to help him on his search. This film, which runs 2:38, unfolds with a slow anxiety, but never really manages much tension. Even the violent scenes are underplayed. Perhaps it's that cold Swedish outlook. The musical score is often pervasive and occasionally in the way.

Before the games begin, they visit the dramatically-modern capital city, where they're groomed for TV and prepped for the fight. Jennifer Lawrence soaks up most of the screen time as a serious, determined young woman who seems destined to dominate the pack. Once the match begins, her home-grown survival skills come to play. The action is sporadic with all the killings dispatched quickly and painlessly (for the PG-13 rating). The art direction is colorful and the drama unfolds with solid zeal. Fans of the books will probably appreciate the film more. I found it satisfying without being special."" ]"

It follows the adventures of a boy who lives in a Paris train station and has a fascination with all things mechanical. The plot and dialogue are minimal, making this an almost silent film. The visuals, on the other hand, are amazing. This is director Martin Scorsese's most stylishly inventive film and the 3D is spectacular.

Thanks to Kato, who designs cool cars/weapons and has real martial arts skills, they target crime. The dialogue is filled with irony and laughs. The slam-bang action sequences are full of fun stunts and smashing cartoon violence and director Michael Gondry adds his off-the-wall touches.

If you like this crew's antics, you won't be disappointed. There are even a few almost-arty slow-mo segments that magnify the impacts. Oh yea, I didn't want to spend the extra $ for 3D, so I saw it in 2D and doubt I missed anything."" ]"

This film is based on the true story of Aron Ralston (played by James Franco), who was hiking alone in Utah, when his arm got trapped under a bolder. To keep it involving, his attempts to free himself are intercut with his survival efforts, flashes of imagination, and even humor.

The film harks back to director Robert Rodriguez's early style (a la \""El Mariachi\""): jammed cuts, hard action and ironic humor. Danny Trejo plays a renegade lawman who slices his way through the bad buys with all manner of blades. There's a plot, but it's more about enjoying the sharply-crafted filmmaking. The grindhouse style is plenty violent, but the flashes of fun and great characters make it completely cool. How often do you see Lindsay Lohan in a nun's habit, shooting one of our greatest actors?"" ]"

A simply brilliant take on a remarkable phenomenon."" ]"

Navigating the financial details is a challenge, but the basics of love and revenge are pretty clearly spelled out. Director Oliver Stone is at the top of his game: rich locations, attractive cinematography, snazzy editing and uniformly rich performances.

Their relationship forms the story's emotional center, but the fact that she's a vampire complicates matters.

However, this isn't really one for kids: it's got the required ironic dialogue (much of it funny) and pop culture references.

He brilliantly examines all sides of this complex character. What's hard is that every scene goes on too long (which makes the movie too long) and Barney keeps repeating his bad behaviors (which makes the movie frustrating).

The movie basically becomes a heist flick that's bookended by two elaborate, action-packed chases. Sure, there's lots of fast driving, but it's not about racing.

battleship;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""This movie is based on the Hasbro board game and they actually manage to slip in a bit of the game's design into the plot. However, most of it revolves around an alien invasion that two scrappy groups must scramble to stop. After a slow first third that establishes Taylor Kitsch as a screw-up, it gets down to battling a superior military force. While nothing about the plot or procedures is original, the enemy's technology is impressive and the effects are convincing. There's plenty of cool combat to help distract from the cheesy writing. Overall, the action is solid, but not particularly novel or clever."", ""NOTE: Stay through the credits for an extended bonus scene."" ]"
magic-mike;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This semi-autobiographical story of Channing Tatum's own experiences as a male dancer casts him in the role of elder stripper, who introduces the newbie (Alex Pettyfer) into the biz. Of course, there is lots of buff male flesh, but nobody's taking it seriously. Director Steven Soderbergh has crafted the trite story into a winning narrative, but it's Tatum who's in every sense the star: his stature as THE leading man of his generation continues to develop, thanks to his charismatic presence and comic charms (not to mention his physique and flashy dance moves). As the boss, Matthew McConaughey turns in a enjoyable over-the-top performance that reflects the rowdy fun attitude of this movie."" ]"

Following the style of the previous Bourne's, there's flashy editing and blurry camerawork, which makes it hard to tell what's happening"" ]"

As it progresses, the definition expands in several ways. There's not really a plot here, more of a situation: she lives in an isolated bayou community with her father, but since it's told thru her eyes, everything takes on a dramatic and fanciful perspective. The remarkable performance by newcmer Quvenzhané Wallis has you alternating between wanting to comfort her and cheer her pluck. The film feels and looks low-budget (esp. the never-ending shaky camera), but there's a sophistication to the naiveté. This cinematic poem is charming, arresting and frustrating"" ]"

Finally, comes the big, noisy, kinda silly showdown: implausible on so many levels. Luckily, the cast is full of quality actors, so most of the interaction works. This is a classic big-budget summer flick with spectacular scenarios and flashy effects. Not the best, but not the worst.

Even with a few breather moments, the pacing never lags and there's enough variety to avoid repetitive peddling scenes. If you're wondering how a simple trip downtown can take up 90 minutes, you'll be surprised to see how strong editing and creative storytelling can propel it forward. This is not a major motion picture event, but it sure is action packed and fun!"" ]"

Mark Wahlberg plays a mid-thirties man who's still dependent on his teddy bear, which became his real-life best friend when he was a boy. This causes problems with his job performance and his human relationship (Mila Kunis). Having a cuddly stuffed animal that cusses constantly, smokes pot and is sex-obsessed is sufficient source of comedy for many, but writer/Ted's voice MacFarlane manages a steady stream of truly funny wisecracks (and no group is spared).

That project is \""Psycho\"" and the challenges of making it and the relationship with his wife take up the rest of the film. As any fan knows, **** dry, dark humor was his most enjoyable asset and this film gives us plenty to laugh about. His obsessions are also explored, but never too darkly.

That' the crux of this magical, magnificent film brilliantly brought to the screen by Ang Lee. The philosophy-laden run up and the mystical follow up must be endured to get the whole story, but it's worth the effort. The struggle for survival is spellbinding and Lee has created some imagery that's astoundingly beautiful. Where the real animals end and the CGI begins is seamless. The 3D doesn't really add that much, but most theaters don't give many alternatives. Whether or not you appreciate the metaphysical aspects, Lee again demonstrates that he's one of the great modern masters of cinema."" ]"

The script has plenty of humor and only drags for a few moments. Jonathan Levine, who succeeded in combining cancer with comedy in \""50/50,\"" shows a knack for staging offbeat jokes.

The trail starts with the torture of detainees that garners tiny bits of information, then follows a lead that results in the crucial raid. Keep in mind, this takes 157 minutes, a lot of which is spent in closeups of Chastain's frustrated face. Much of the early discussion is complicated and confusing. Even after they get a break, the time is spent in debate and delay. The final assault is played out with dramatic detail, without music or flashy staging. Director Kathryn Bigelow has crafted scenes of interest and occasional power, but the movie is simply too long. Much of the early setup could have been sacrificed to tell a more compelling story. It's never boring, but it sure is long."" ]"

Along their way, they encounter a wacky family and some other complications. While the plot points are obvious, there's a liberal sprinkling of humorous lines and comical characters.

This is a fast-paced, quick-witted character study about a man who's more of a mess than he seems. Gordon-Levitt has fully immersed himself in the character and it's a winner. His scenes of dinner with his dad (Tony Danza) are great fun.

This examination of aging and restrained relationships is directed by Alexander Payne with deadpan delivery and lovely black and white cinematography. It's one of those quietly observed indies with tapped down emotions and humor that's usually underplayed (except June Squibb as his amusingly feisty wife). The filmmaking is as reserved as the characters: no grand emotions or splashy performances, just a quietly sweet cinematic journey."" ]"

After that unpleasant expedition, they get dragged back into the 75th game. The first half of the film sets up the political and personal drama, while the jungle adventure is full of weird environmental challenges (as opposed to personal combat). Lawrence is grim and serious. So is everybody else for that matter. The effects are fine, but the only visual fun comes from Elizabeth Banks' fabulous fashions. The action is adequate without being especially exciting or remotely inventive. This sequel is a lot more about drama and relationships and much less about action and sci-fi dazzle. Probably more popular with fans of the books, since it serves to set up the coming conflict."" ]"

The cast is full of outstanding performances with Michael Fassbender and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o delivering memorable moments. Director Steve McQueen has incredible skills for observation and visual artistry. Every image is beautiful. Despite the stifling oppression and unflinching violence, there's a certain detachment that renders the outcome more observation than experience.

Scarlett Johansson plays a woman who accidentally ingests a substance that enables her to use increasingly large portions of her brain's ability. This gives her powers that allow her to control the world around her. The film is full of cool ideas that are illuminated with strong special effects. Johansson is up to the challenges of super skills, both mentally and physically. Writer/director Luc Besson has added his signature action (that crazy car chase) to give the visuals even more of an impact. A fun trip!"" ]"

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a fast-talking, self-confident new entrant into the field, who's determination for success crosses the line between objective observer and dangerous participant. His character is a smart, but not saavy charmer without a conscience and Gyllenhaal makes him fascinating with masterful skill.

The scenery is expectedly lovely and the complex sound design adds an almost trippy layer to her journey. This double-edged \""adventure\"" is continually compelling, but not as emotionally rewarding as you'd expect.

boyhood;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""You probably know the unique concept: This film blends real time and fiction as it looks in on the maturation of a boy and his family for 12 years, as he literally grows on camera. The time progress seamlessly, as life's everyday interactions take place between his family and friends. There are some landmarks, but more often it's the understated, mundane moments that blend into a quietly powerful portrait. Director Richard Linklater mines humor and emotion in the seemingly ordinary dialogue and the passage of minor cultural landmarks. The performances are uniformly natural and completely compelling. Even at 2:45, every minute captivates as only true life can. A modest masterpiece."" ]"

In the 50s, he was arrested and his solitary life took an unfortunate turn. Cumberbatch turns in a nuanced and touching performance without ever being pitiful (Alex Lawther is also poignant as the young Turing). The intelligent and sometimes humorous screenplay provides a solid groundwork for this compelling story.

The characters are interesting and the situations are inventive.

This alternates with his struggles to adapt to the civilian world of husband and father, presented by Eastwood with empathy but restrained emotion.

This is really just a cat-and-mouse romance with a BDSM twist. It's success depends on the performances of the 2 leads and the director's skill at maintaining tension in what's basically a dialogue. Surprisingly, Dornan is prettier than Johnson, but they both create characters that are complex and compelling. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has filled the film with sexually-charged stress and attractively erotic sex scenes. It's every woman's dream of a dazzling, devoted lover (granted, with some emotional complications) and it's played out with alluring skill."" ]"
love-mercy;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""This is not the standard musician biopic, but a fascinating and immensely absorbing examination of the artistic, emotional and mental struggles of Brian Wilson (the creative powerhouse behind the Beach Boys). The timeline alternates between his peak years, when he was starting to experiment with their sound (played by Paul Dano) and the period after his breakdown (played by John Cusak), when therapist Dr. Eugene Landy dominated his existence. Both actors are mesmerizing, brilliantly capturing Wilson's complexity and charisma. As the woman who saves him, the usually outsize Elizabeth Banks is a quiet revelation. Producer-turned-director Bill Pohlad has crafted a compellingly complex examination into the creative process and one of the most effective studies of mental illness ever on screen. Although the musician's oppressive struggles keep the film in a continual dark place (with a sometimes slow pace), the film's quiet power and artistic mastery create an enthralling cinematic exploration.

The film starts as a low-key romance, but slowly turns darker, as the young man discovers Escobar's evil power. From there, it transforms into a somewhat suspenseful ride, as he struggles to escape the web of cruelty and murder. Hutcherson nicely captures the bewildered innocence of his plight, while del Toro creates a subdued villain with a human side. This film's quiet power evolves into a disturbing journey. Subtitles when Spanish is spoken."" ]"

The duo stumbles across an abandoned cop car and go for a joyride. When the sheriff (Kevin Bacon) discovers his situation, he scrambles to cover his mistake. The innocent enthusiasm of the boys provides continual amusement, while provoking perilous caution from us grown-ups who better appreciate the dangers they face. The Coen Brothers' early films come to mind as the simple narrative develops into a compelling and quietly suspenseful ride."" ]"

He plays a boxing champ who loses virtually everything and struggles to recover his life and, more importantly, the custody of his daughter (an equally impressive performance by young Oona Laurence). Director Antoine Fuqua uses his mastery of the form to create many compelling moments and outstanding images. Expectedly, there are several extended, but not especially original boxing scenes. This film might have more effective if there were moments of humor to lighten the load. As it stands, the potential for a truly powerful picture is weakened by its relentless seriousness. Gyllenhaal's performance is impressive, but the plot's predictability, the director's heavy handedness and the harsh dark drama impede its full potential."" ]"

This promises some mind-stretching concepts, framed by confusing scientific discussions. You can also expect some cool visuals, although the camera often focuses more on faces than spectacular effects. As for the human aspect, it's all about his emotional connection with his daughter back on Earth. The power of love has its part to play and McConaughey cries a lot! Hans Zimmer's overpowering music sometimes gets in the way and some of the story clichés dilute the potential majesty of the voyage. Don't get me wrong, there's lots to recommend in Christopher Nolan's splendid film and the 169 minute length never bores, it was just less amazing than I expected."" ]"

The storytelling is solid and the battles are OK, but there's nothing especially original or innovative about this new world (even the popular BB-8 is a re-imagining of R2D2).

Tomlin is enjoyably cantankerous and cruel-mouthed as she runs thru her repertoire of old friends and flames (including Sam Elliott in the most sensitive performance of his career). There are only a few outright laughs (and most of them are in the trailer), but the spunky energy of the relationships and Tomlin's undeniable force tint the film toward upbeat humor.

The period recreations add visual appeal and the costumes are especially attractive (every tie is fantastic). The writing is snappy and involving, but the story sags in the middle when the drama drags it down. Still, a fascinating history lesson centered around Cranston's potent portrayal."" ]"
avengers-age-of-ultron;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The gang's all back (with a few young new heroes) to save the world…this time from a robotic villain with an unusual view of peace. There are lots of fast-paced, noisy battles with action so blurry you often can't tell what's happening. The dialogue is dotted with amusing one-liners and every character gets a few personal moments. What’s missing: any shocks, tension or surprises (including nothing at the very end of the credits, although there is one quickie after the closing title sequence). Even at 2:20, it never lags, but there's nothing spectacular or innovative in this sequel. Still, writer/director Joss Whedon has jammed it full of entertaining, popcorn fun."" ]"
straight-outta-compton;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""This is a biopic of N.W.A., the seminal gangster rappers who rose from the violent streets of Compton, California in the mid-80s. The first hour lays out their hood's brutal culture and their rise to national success. The next 90 minutes (yes, it's 147 minutes long) watches as the 3 major members (Easy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube) go their separate ways and struggle with their own success. Director F Gary Gray has succeeded in crafting an environment that effectively reflects their aggressive, intense world, while managing to create sensitive portraits of the main characters. It's noisy, brutal and decadent, yet informative, empathetic and affecting."" ]"

Without ever resorting to easy or expected devices, this film is sweet, touching, suspenseful and moving. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brilliantly created an intimate story that's powerful, yet understated. The best film I've seen this year."" ]"
the-33;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Most people will recall this incredible news story from 2010, when 33 miners were trapped for 69 days before being rescued. This cinematic retelling effectively captures the details of this incredible situation, while attempting to establish emotional connections with a handful of the men. The depiction the dire challenges is presented with dramatic incredulity and the personal moments are mildly involving. It's more fascinating than gripping, but still a well-told story. One weird Hollywood tradition still holds: this takes place in Chile, but everyone speaks English with Spanish accents. To make things even more confusing, there's one Spanish-speaking reporter and all the writing is in Spanish."" ]"
steve-jobs;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Unlike the typical biopic, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has set this one backstage just before the launch of 3 different products (Macintosh, NeXT, iMac). While the tech gets a nod, the focus is on the man and his relationships with 3 primary people (Steve Wozniak, John Sculley, his daughter Lisa). Sorkin has brilliantly combined a lot of information into a crowded, time-limited backdrop. Director Danny Boyle has added a frantic, intimate style to keep the focus on the people (all of whom are superb, esp. Michael Fassbender in the title role and Kate Winslet as his \""work wife\""). While demonstrating Jobs' genius, this film clearly shows his gruff professional style and challenges with relationships. A fascinating, informative and compelling glimpse into his life."" ]"
black-mass;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Johnny Depp piles on the makeup to play notorious Irish mobster James “Whitey” Bulger. This solemn film tells the story of his rise to power in Boston and the collaboration with the FBI that allowed him to become so ruthless. Depp's steely cold exterior results in a subdued portrayal that sometimes exposes the undercurrent of rage and violence. The entire cast inhabits their rough characters with unattractive authenticity. The continuous overtone of anger, mistrust and unhappiness pervades the film's every minute, but this is also its weakness. Some lighter moments would have added contrast and mounting tension would have made the experience more intense. As it stands, the performances are strong, but the constant low level of conflict never builds to any emotional or dramatic impact."" ]"

He became known as Lily Elbe, one of the first known transgenders to also undergo sexual reassignment surgery. Redmayne is perfect for the role, not only because he makes such a beautiful woman (more so than the real thing: see below), but because he’s such a gifted and brilliantly expressive actor. His delicate nuanced portrayal is exceptionally touching. But this story is about both of them and Vikander also turns in a moving performance. The locations are lovely and the dresses gorgeous, but every plot development takes too long to unfold. Even with the languid pace, this film is a quietly sweet and beautifully tender examination of love and self expression."" ]"

He determines to stay alive by using science, ingenuity and pluck, while NASA strategizes on rescue plans. Unlike \""Gravity\"" (which it will be inevitably compared to) this is more about science than suspense. Solutions are methodically discussed and tried with few setbacks. Despite this more intellectual approach, Damon's performance is spirited, amusing and occasionally touching. Director Ridley Scott manages to make the moving parts and technical explanations acceptable, while mining a bit of emotion and even humor in the interactions. Overall, it's a well-crafted and captivating tale of human survival."" ]"
in-the-heart-of-the-sea;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Since this is the truth-based story that inspired 'Moby-Dick,\"" you'd expect it to be all about the crew vs. the whale. While that's a big part, this narrative expands to become a story of survival at sea. The encounters with the CGI creatures, as well as a harrowing storm, are amazingly rendered. On top of that, the grand style of the cinematography and rich look of the art direction add a layer of visual majesty. Then there's the actual drama: It unfolds with encounters and relationships that are too trite, flashes back to the storyteller (which halts the pace) and never really creates characters that are compelling (even Chris Hemworth seems like yet another superhero). The film attempts to be grand storytelling in a classic vein (albeit with lots of quick cuts), but lacks the spirit to capture the heart."" ]"
macbeth-2015;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""You probably know the story, but it's never been told like this. First, it's been re-imagined with a more rustic, less grand style...often raw and dirty. Second, almost all of the dialogue is intensely introspective, no booming soliloquies here. Despite that, the performances are raw and passionate. The Scottish brogue sometimes makes the dialogue difficult to follow and the concentrated, deliberate pacing becomes a bit monotonous. Finally, the liberties with style are striking! In addition to the staggering Scottish landscapes, DP Adam Arkapaw has shot every scene with visual power that gives \""art film\"" a whole new meaning. The dialogue has been trimmed to make room for some beautifully shot (often in slo-mo) battles, quiet moments of ceremony and other evocative stylings. This is brilliant realization and masterful revelation of cinematic imagination."" ]"

Their relationship develops during that period, but the film is really about Smith’s performance. She’s not doing anything new here, just her usually spunky, prickly style, but she also manages a few moments of sweet vulnerability. There’s not really much plot, but depth is added thru flashbacks to events that formed her present state. Smith fans will not be disappointed, even though she’s much more crusty than stately in this role."" ]"
creed;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Despite the title (which refers to the son of Apollo Creed), this film is just as much about Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) as it is about the ambitious young boxer. When he decides to follow in his famous father's footsteps, he travels to Philadelphia to enlist the champ as his trainer. The plot follows a familiar structure: intimate personal moment, dramatic encounter, training montage, big fight…repeat. Fortunately, a massively muscled-up Michael B. Jordan brings a fierce energy and determination to his role. Surprisingly, the film's most compelling performance (and the only humor) comes from Stallone. Director Ryan Coogler (\""Fruitvale Station\"") has kept the interactions involving and made the fights forceful (especially the one that never cuts or leaves the close proximity inside the ring). This is a pumped-up version of the original, slightly too long, but big on heartfelt passion and personal power."" ]"
sing-street;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Writer/director John Carney has previously helmed 2 films about musicians and their creative process (\""Once\"" & \""Begin Again\""). This one revolves around a young teen in 80s Dublin who forms a band to impress a girl. The resulting group of misfits is cute in their awkward innocence, while the period style and music pervade the film's atmosphere. The band performs a number of original songs (by Carney) that prove to be catchy pop fun. In addition to the musical treats, it's a truly sweet story of a young man's efforts to express himself and his love. Sure, you can bask in the nostalgia of MTV's early days, but you'll also find yourself charmed by the film's buoyant youthful optimism."" ]"

On his journey, he meets some new animals (most enjoyably Bill Murray as Baloo) and has some perilous adventures. They've even tossed in 3 songs from the original film (plus a fun 2nd version of \""Bare Necessities\"" by Dr. John during the credits). As the final frame of the credits states, \""This film was shot in downtown Los Angeles,\"" but the lovely landscapes and slew of creatures is eye-catching and beautifully designed. The action is well-staged and the story comes together with lively energy. Still, it lacks that extra punch that would have made it wondrous and emotionally satisfying (and Sethi's performance could have been a bit more charming)."" ]"
me-before-you;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""If you're familiar with Emilia Clarke from \""Game of Thrones\"" (she's the blonde Khaleesi, Mother of Dragons) you'll be surprised by this dramatically different performance. Her character is an extremely cheerful, slightly kooky woman with a delightful fashion sense. She's hired as caretaker/companion for a handsome man who's confined to a wheelchair (Sam Claflin). He's pretty much given up on life until her smiling charms cheer him up. But keep your hankies ready, ladies, cause the outcome is not what you'd expect. This pretty much follows the \""weepie\"" formula with prominent music that contributes to the romantic mood (of course, it includes Adele). Even with it's familiar structure, the winning performances by the two leads and the upbeat writing make this a sweetly charming chick flick."" ]"

The show's producer (Julia Roberts) tries to maintain control and calm, as the hostage situation plays out live on the air. The performances are compelling and director Jodie Foster has crafted an interesting and mildly tense drama. She strives to minimize the script's indictments of our financial system and mostly succeeds in keeping the focus on the people. It's never especially riveting, but manages to be an absorbing entertainment."" ]"
the-meddler;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Established actors sometimes find movies with a quirky character that allows them to flex their acting muscles. This is the case for Susan Sarandon, as she plays a New Jersey mother who moves to LA to be closer to her daughter (Rose Byrne). As the title suggests, she can't leave anyone alone: She's driven to express her opinion, give advice and even offer money. Though it's promoted as a comedy, this is more a lite drama that examines a complex woman thru several sweet interactions. As expected, Sarandon has spunky charm, but she also manages moments of quiet poignancy. The cast is good (J. K. Simmons is esp. warm) and the pace never lags. Sarandon doesn't give a flashy performance and the movie isn't striving for hilarity, but its low-key charms are undeniable."" ]"

Their erotic retreat is upended when one of her exes (Ralph Fiennes) shows up with his daughter (Dakota Johnson). There's not a straight-ahead plot here, only a group of people enjoying the getaway…at first, at least. An undercurrent of attraction and jealousy adds to the tension that develops. As always, Swinton is thoroughly compelling (even though she barely speaks) and Fiennes shows a crazy energy that's both stimulating and creepy. This is unmistakably a foreign film: the interaction of the characters holds an enigmatic depth that's explored thru subtle, unhurried direction by Luca Guadagnino (\""I Am Love,\"" also starring Swinton). There's also quite a bit of casual nudity. Enjoyable, enthralling yet uncomfortable."" ]"

As expected, they end up with an equally-wild duo (Anna Kendrick & Aubrey Plaza). The filmmakers didn't fall for the current trope of outlandish jokes and gross-out gags. Instead, they allowed the characters (and occasional funny lines) to carry the comedy. Devine is the focus of the fun: his wacky, uninhibited antics make the movie. The others are enjoyable and add to the upbeat energy. While this isn't a breakthru in any way, it does make for an entertaining \""date.\"""" ]"

When tragedy strikes, he and his crusty \""uncle\"" (Sam Neill) set out on an extended adventure in the bush, which causes a massive manhunt. There's a quirky charm to the characters and a wacky edge to the story that makes is sweetly charming.

finding-dory;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The original had Marlin (Albert Brooks) \""Finding Nemo,\"" with Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) as a hilarious sidekick. When you try to make a sidekick the star, their casual presence doesn't always work as the focus. Dory, who has only short term memory, decides to go in search of her parents. This takes her on adventures all over an aquatic theme park, but the sequel is darker, literally and thematically. Where the first featured colorful, delightful animation, this one often takes place in murky, gloomy environments. Dory's search leads to continuous self-doubt and hesitation. The movie runs too long, partially because the story takes too many twists and turns (ebbs and flows?). DeGeneres' flippant way with a punch line still lands the laffs and there are the requisite new wacky characters. Although less delightful than the original, it still has moments of entertaining fun. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for an extended gag."" ]"

The interaction between the characters holds up the terse comic style that's kept relationships so enjoyable. There are the expected cool efx, amazing environments and neat creature makeup.

the-revenant-2015;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""Leonardo DiCaprio plays a hunter/tracker whose encounter with a bear is only the beginning of his struggle for survival in the frigid American northwest of the 1800s. This brutal journey is intensified by director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s masterful vision for capturing the harshness of nature and malevolence of men. Some of the sequences are technically astounding. Add to that the incredible scenery and immensely beautiful (mostly available light) cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. DiCaprio suffers with extreme commitment, but it’s the almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy, whose menacing villain is the acting standout. Even with the 3-hour running time, the intensity never slacks and the skillful storytelling creates a harshly compelling cinematic tour de force."" ]"
snowden;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""As the famous/notorious Edward Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quietly compelling (even though he adopts the flat delivery of Keanu Reeves). This biopic alternates between his covert meetings with the reporters who released the NSA documents and the career events that lead up to it. The details are interesting, but his relationship with his girlfriend (Shailene Woodley) drags on the momentum. Sure, the paranoia message is requisite, but director Oliver Stone let it become too didactic and too constant. As a result, the basic story is still fascinating and well told, but it's power is diluted by the film's 134 minute length."" ]"

Sasha Lane (also a non-actor) plays a young woman who runs away from her extremely dysfunctional family to join them. Her journey is not much about the magazines; more about her own stubborn, spunky attitude and the relationship she establishes with the lead seller (Shai LeBeouf).

Toss them in a blender and you have the inevitable fight to save the world. One of the things that makes this more enjoyable is that each hero's abilities are used in interesting ways, instead of the typical massively-destructive battles. The character interaction is usually engaging and best of all, there are no long scenes of metaphysical hand-wringing or interpersonal drama. Most of the encounters are brief and compelling. The action sequences are well staged, even sometimes cool. After 2.5 hours, the last 20 minutes drag down with muddy conclusions, but it's still one of my favorite superhero flix. Of course, stay thru the credits for a very confusing setup."" ]"

The spunky script peppers the continuous indignities and inequities that are heaped upon them with humor that adds warmth and humanity. Their performances are all winning. This film is fascinating in its exploration the early history of our space program, but it also delves into the discrimination against these women in an easy to swallow, entertaining package.

The story starts in 1939 Poland, where the titular character (Jessica Chastain) and her husband (Johan Heldenbergh) lovingly care for the inhabitants of the Warsaw Zoo. When the Nazi's invade, their secret mission to shelter Jews takes the story in a dark direction. All of the actors are strong and director Niki Caro has created a mostly-compelling experience. The inhumane treatment by the Germans cast the appropriate despair and the brave actions by the zookeepers are  intrepid.

It's full of quiet discussions with the potential candidates about her attributes and her confidence. Noa Koler's performance helps to keep the story interesting.

This is a sensitive story with loveably gruff characters who have a hard time expressing their feelings and often hurt instead. Affleck and Hedges are powerful in their subtlety and restrained emotions. The script by Kenneth Lonergan is intelligently crafted with eloquently mundane observations, while his authoritative direction is detached, yet sensitive (look for him in a cameo as a man on the street who berates Affleck for his lousy parenting).

Mara manages to capture the conflicting parts of her character with a combo of steely determination and weepy eyes. Despite the opportunities for crying and suffering, the emotions are usually subdued, which means there's no big tearful payoff.

Comparisons to \""Single White Female\"" are inevitable and Plaza effectively captures that creepy vibe. She also manages to make her character understandable, although not ever sympathetic.

The only real sincere character is played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr. who's appealing in his first role since \""Straight Outta Compton.\"" The film's desperate narrative pushes credibility in some of the relationships (esp. his), but it does tell a compelling story.

Both segments have moments of compelling drama and beautiful cinematography. They also both go on too long: the hopeless despair in India and the mental torment in Australia.

She teams up with James McAvoy, but more importantly, takes on dozens of men with painful blows and whatever object she can use as a weapon. The fight sequences are brutally forceful and even better, there's no blurry camerawork and flashy editing to hide the hard stunt work. It's all staggeringly evident. Meanwhile, the film enjoys a colorful 80s neon noir look and the period tunes provide a jammin' soundtrack. The rather conventional plot keeps turning on itself (as spies often do) and that becomes a bit much. This film is all about the well-staged chases and fierce fights."" ]"

The first hour sets up the characters with slow scenes of dialogue, then a riveting encounter happens to intensify the tension. The bleak Wyoming environment (actually shot in Utah) creates a forceful presence that adds layer of stark stress. It was refreshing to see such a strong supporting cast of Native American actors.

Ryan Reynolds is the perfect actor to play the role. He smartly nails every clever quip and witty observation, plus he’s easy on the eyes. The script is by the guys who penned “Zombieland,” so that gives you an idea of the non-stop wise cracks and smart pop culture references that fill the dialogue. The comic-book-style action is edited with a rapid-fire pace, but unlike so many modern fights, you can follow every punch. The approach is irreverent, sarcastic and very funny.

Very action-packed, and at times very gory.  The audience was screaming and squirming at times.  Great locales too, especially the catacombs in Italy.  The ending sets up another sequel and I look forward to it. The only real negative is that the bad guys can't shoot and kill John at close distances even when he is grossly outnumbered, but of course that happens in every shoot-em-up film of this genre.

If you make a film too realistic looking, does it take away from the animation experience?  The characters throughout the film had an animated look which was a stark contrast to the realistic landscape.  The movie felt like Roger Rabbit at times, which used animated characters in a live action film.  The plot, overcoming and facing your fears, has been used in many animated films before, but it had another good storyline as well, not jumping to conclusions before you know all the facts.

My favorite part of the film, however, was the look and style.  Loved the 60s hairdos and clothes, the cars from the era, and the exotic locations.  The film pushes the line into camp without going overboard.  All in all, not a masterpiece but a fun time at the movies."" ]"
inside-out-2015;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I enjoyed Inside Out.  Did I love it?  No.  Is it one of Pixar's best?  Not for me.  It felt a little long, and I was a little bored now and then.  I saw it in a theater full of kids and there was some restlessness, which doesn't happen for the best Pixar films.  It isn't a bad film, but it certainly isn't as funny as some of Pixar's films.  It mostly deals with a little girl's depression about moving to a new city with her family.  In fact, I only remember one laugh out loud part, where we get a glimpse into a boy teenager's mind when he tries to talk to a girl.  I would rank this one somewhere in the middle of all the Pixar films, which means it's still way above average compared to most animated features, but not a classic."" ]"
the-spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I'm a fan of the SpongeBob TV show.  I enjoyed the film, although it wasn't as funny as some of the TV episodes.  The TV show where SpongeBob sells chocolate door to door make me laugh so hard my stomach hurt.  Nothing in this film is quite as funny but it still was humorous and held my attention throughout.  The animation itself was fun to look at.  It really held the attention of the kids in the theater as there weren't any squirming talking kids while it was on.  I do wish Squidward was featured more as I like his cynical personality.  The 3D effects were good as well.  It will be a Blu-ray purchase when it comes out."" ]"
ex-machina;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Probably my favorite film about Artificial Intelligence.  Much better than last years \""Her\"".  I enjoyed the slow pace and the lack of a constant annoying loud soundtrack like most movies have.  A constant interplay between the two intelligent main characters (three if you count Ava) will have you guessing to the end.  I thought Oscar Isaac was great in the Coen Brothers film \""Inside Llewyn Davis\"" and he is the standout in this film as well.  The entire film, including the few humorous moments, had a creepiness to it that I enjoyed.  I wish more films were made in this style."" ]"
paddington;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""I was surprised at how much I liked this movie.  Certainly not the greatest kids movie ever made, but not the totally predictable movie I thought it would be.  There were a few laugh out loud moments.  Nicole Kidman was perfect as the \""bad guy\"" as well.  I enjoyed the English humor and there were politically incorrect moments that may not have made it into an American film that I appreciated (such as getting someone inebriated on purpose).  The interplay between the live actors and the computer generated bear was flawless which is a tribute to the actors involved, and the film looks great."" ]"
into-the-woods;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The cast of Into The Woods is very enthusiastic, and that is what carries the film.  All the actors carry off the singing with no problems but make no mistake, the star is Meryl Streep.  The best part of the entire movie for me was Meryl's performance towards the beginning of the film when she sang to the couple indoors.  The word play was terrific.  I also have always liked the song \""Children Will Listen\"", especially the version Barbra Streisand does on one of her CDs.  The rest of the songs, however, were not very catchy or memorable, and that is the one issue I had with the film.  Some of these songs might translate better live on a stage.  Chris Pine was also a standout for me, and he has an excellent singing voice.  I like Emily Blunt in everything she does.  The few children that were in the theater were antsy and fidgety, although there were moments when they were quiet and paid attention, particularly when Meryl Streep was on the screen.  The film's look (sets, costumes and makeup) is stellar.  If the songs were better I would rank it higher."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""If you've read the books, you already know going into this latest installment it will be a downer.  There are no more games, so the movie focuses on the interplay between Katniss and the Capital, and trying to get the remaining districts on board with the rebellion.  The installment is very faithful to the book, and the look and feel was exactly as I pictured it when I read it.  As a stand alone film it may not be successful, but who wants to watch one film in the middle of a series without watching the rest of the series?  Personally I was never bored watching it.  A little depressed, maybe, but The Hunger Games is not an uplifting series to begin with.  Jennifer Lawrence was stellar as usual, and carries the entire film.  I also liked Julianne Moore as President Coin and Elizabeth Banks as Effie.  Women actors are really dominating this series.  The look of the film is also terrific.  If you read the books I think you will enjoy this latest installment."" ]"
the-zero-theorem;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""With Terry Gilliam's films it's all about the ride, not necessarily the destination.  Christoph Waltz gives his usual stellar performance, and the acting throughout is excellent, but my favorite performance in the film is by Mélanie Thierry.  If you've seen his other films, especially Brazil, you will have a sense of Deja Vu, as Mr. Gilliam seems obsessed with finding the meaning of life.  Visually striking and always interesting.

the-hundred-foot-journey;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""While watching The Hundred-Foot Journey you will get feelings of predictability, especially if you've seen as many films as I have.  Hollywood has been making films about clashes of cultures for a long time.  At least the clash between the two restaurant families resolves itself a little over the halfway mark.  The rest of the film is the journey of the gifted Indian Chef.  I enjoyed the film overall, especially Helen Mirren, but there isn't enough here to warrant repeated viewings."" ]"
the-wind-rises;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I've seen all of Miyazaki's films.  This certainly looked like a Miyazaki film, but it didn't feel like one.  Usually his films are full of fantasy and imagination.  This is a slow moving, straight-forward love story set during a war about a man who is passionate about designing and building airplanes and falls in love with a woman with TB.  All of his other films were aimed at children, but young kids will get fidgety at this one, especially since it is 2 hours in length.  You will also have to explain to your child why the leading man is a chain smoker and why he wants to design planes that drop bombs on other countries.  In other words, this is a film for adults.  All that said, the artwork in this film is gorgeous.  I don't know how he draws buildings that look so real, and he is the absolute best at getting lighting correct.  The film will hold your attention on its look alone.  It's sad that this is the last film he will direct but I'm sure he will remain involved in Studio Ghibli and they will continue to release great movies."" ]"

chef;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Chef was an unexpected pleasure.  I have to admit, even though I attend movies all the time, I had no idea who Jon Favreau was.  Turns out he's both a talented actor and director.  The movie is about the relationship between a father and son, and choosing to live a life that makes you happy.  There are a few moments of unbelievability, such as his ex wife and girlfriend are two of the most beautiful women working in Hollywood (Scarlett Johansson and Sofía Vergara), and just when you think he finally realizes his relationship with his son is the most important thing in his life he nearly blows it yet again.  But that is nitpicking.  It's well written and acted and funny throughout.  Especially the road trip.  Really enjoyed it."" ]"
dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I really hated the first film in this new series.  \""Dawn\"" is a major improvement.  This is a movie you go to see for the visuals, not the storyline.  For the most part, the apes look real.  There are some moments when they don't quite move like a living creature would move, but overall a really good job.  The storyline is similar to the old Charleton Heston film, nothing new there.  The acting is pretty mediocre, but it's probably difficult to act when the ape your talking to doesn't exist in real life.  I did find it annoying when the apes spoke.  They usually spoke very slowly, but when the word came out it was perfect English, so not sure why they couldn't speak faster.  I know people love Gary Oldman but to me his performance was way over-the-top.  Overall there were more things to like than dislike so I recommend it."" ]"
under-the-skin;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""I was mesmerized the entire movie.  Thank God for directors that don't rely on a heavy classical soundtrack that annoys and distracts.  Natural noises, such as wind blowing, footsteps, clocks ticking are far more effective.  When music was used it was creepy and atmospheric.  The bleak Scottish cityscapes and natural beauty only added to the atmosphere.  There are scenes in the film I will never forget.  I thought Scarlett Johansson was terrific, although I'm already a big fan of hers.  I don't need a complete story tied up in a bow for satisfaction, this little slice of Sci Fi was excellent.  My only small critiques was that the story of an alien or robot becoming sympathetic to humans has been done before many times, and the Scottish accents were so heavy I couldn't understand some of the dialogue, but it was not distracting enough to ruin my enjoyment.  Not for everyone but if it is your style you will love it.  A director to watch for sure."" ]"
jack-ryan-shadow-recruit;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Chris Pine is the latest to play Jack Ryan, following Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck.  This latest version is made in the more modern style of the Bourne and Mission Impossible movies with a lot of action and noise.  Most of the movie is completely ludicrous, as are most movies in this genre, but it is well made and acted.  I was hoping before the movie even began that it wouldn't have the dreaded countdown timer at the end of the movie, but of course they had to throw that in as it seems to be a requirement in all these spy movies.  The scene on the airplane where everyone is trying to figure out where the bad guy is and where he's going to strike next is really ridiculous how they figure it all out in about 3 minutes so you really have to suspend all belief when watching a film like this.  Still, it's never boring!"" ]"

Sound familiar?  It's the plot of Terminator from 30 years ago.  Also the plot of this movie.  I hate time travel movies because they make no sense so I probably would have avoided this movie had I known.  They also use the dreaded Countdown technique where everything comes down to the last second, another overused movie technique in the last several years.  However, I'm still giving it a pass because the special effects are great and the actors seem like they care, and the 3D was excellent."" ]"
non-stop-2014;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is a good solid popcorn film.  The premise is totally unbelievable but it is frantically paced and fun.  These two guys are the fastest \""texters\"" on the planet, nobody can text that fast, and when the bad guy tells him someone will be killed every 20 minutes the hero touches one button on his watch and it is automatically in timer mode set to 20 minutes!  There are many other absurdities, especially the reason that the bad guys are doing this, but I still enjoyed the film because of its action and fast pacing.  Liam Neeson is always fun in this type of role."" ]"
lone-survivor;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""There is a little bit of testosterone overload in Lone Survivor, but that's true of most Hollywood war films.  The gun battle is brutally graphic and the men can't seem to speak without saying the \""F\"" word, so don't go to this movie if you're squeamish or prudish.  I thought it was a well made film, but it wasn't anything new that I haven't seen in other war films, especially war films set in Vietnam such as Platoon.  It certainly isn't a film I would want to see again as I don't find all the graphic violence entertaining, but the film is certainly a reminder of what our military personnel are going through to keep this country safe."" ]"
philomena;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Judy Dench and Steve Coogan play off each other well in this under the radar film. The catholic church once again does not look good in a film, although the atrocities took place 60 years ago in 1950s Ireland. Apparently nuns would take young parent-less women into their convent who had babies out of wedlock and eventually sell their babies to wealthy Americans (true story believe it or not). The story is about one mother who decided to search for her son that was taken away from her 50 years earlier. She accepts the help of an author who hears about the story from the woman's daughter. They have an adventure together, going to America to find the son. There is a surprising amount of humor in addition to the heartbreak. Very well acted and written and easily one of the best films of the year."" ]"
august-osage-county;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Don't be fooled by the trailer - this is not a comedy.  There are some comedic moments here and there, but overall it's a drama about a family who gets together after a family tragedy and the skeletons come out of the closet!  It is based on a play that I didn't see so I can't compare it to the play.  The film reminds me of a couple of Woody Allen's great dramas (\""Interiors\"" and \""September\"") from the 70s and 80s which had the same theme and ensemble feel.  Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are in top form in this film and give Oscar deserving performances.  The supporting cast is pitch perfect and there are no dull moments."" ]"

This film felt more like his animated \""The Fantastic Mr. Fox\"" than any other of his films.  It was like watching a live cartoon.  I really like the fact that he cares about every scene he films and attempts to film it in a way we have not seen before.  I would rank Wes Anderson up with the Coen Brothers for his craft.  I thought all the actors in the film were terrific and I had a grin on my face the entire time I watched it.  I was sorry when it ended, unlike many films I where I look at my watch several times wondering when it would end."" ]"
saving-mr-banks;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Saving Mr. Banks is a solid piece of entertainment.  I didn't love the film, but it was entertaining enough to keep my attention.  I thought the acting was solid throughout, and the depiction of P.L. Travers by Emma Thompson is the glue that holds the film together.  Ms. Travers was obviously an unlikeable, thankless character in real life, and her entrance into the sugary sweet Disney Studios is mostly fun to watch.  She insists on being part of the creative process of putting the film together or she won't sign over the rights to the film.  Her demands are exasperating (\""No Music\"") or ridiculous (\""No color red in the film\"") and she drives the creative team crazy.  Tom Hanks does a nice job as Disney, and even looks a little like him in the eyes.  Overall it was fun but not something I would want to see again."" ]"
inside-llewyn-davis;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Only the Coen Brothers can take such an unlikeable main character and make a completely watchable, entertaining film.  I loved almost the entire film with the exception of the road trip featuring John Goodman and his \""partner\"".  Those characters came across as kind of creepy instead of funny and didn't really add anything to the film.  Other than that, the film had a lot of scenes that made me think of the film long after I left the theater.  I had never heard of Oscar Isaac before this film, but he is totally believable as a frustrated, gifted musician who makes one bad decision after another.  The movie is simply a week or so in a folk singer's life in the early 1960's, and how some struggling musicians lived and survived in the New York Bohemian scene.  It also reminded me a little of the documentary \""20 Feet From Stardom\"" that focused on the mystery of why some talented people never become stars despite having obvious talent.  Loved the black and white photography and I really appreciate the Coen Brothers for thinking outside the box on some of their camera shots.  Overall, definitely one of my favorite films of the year."" ]"
all-is-lost;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""The movie gets no points for originality as we have all seen survival films before, including \""Kon-Tiki\"" from this past year, which was also set on a ship.  However, Redford is so good and the filmmaking is superb so I was riveted to the screen the entire time.  I think everyone can relate to the snowball effect of one bad thing happening after another and you can't catch a break.  The Redford character is relentless in his persistence to survive, and you can't help but root for him because he never gives up.  He keeps one step ahead of death due to his survivor skills.  Kudos to the filmmaking crew with all the close ups, underwater photography, and great ship/ocean noises making you feel like you're on the boat with him."" ]"

dallas-buyers-club;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Matthew McConaughey is nearly unrecognizable as Ron Woodroof, a man who contracts AIDS during the beginnings of the crisis in the 1980s.  He is straight, and homophobic, and when he first learns he has contracted the disease he sets off to Mexico to get medication that is not available in the U.S.  I think at first his intention was to make money selling the drugs in the U.S., but when he meets the gay people in the same predicament as he is he becomes compassionate and comes to the realization that gay people are the same as any other people.  Its a movie about tolerance, acceptance, and the fact that our FDA is more concerned with profit than helping people recover.  McConaughey lost a lot of weight for the role and gives a great performance.  Jared Leto is also in top form as a transsexual who partners with Ron to sell the drugs to the gay community. Overall a very moving film with great performances."" ]"
20-feet-from-stardom;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""This fascinating documentary focuses on the singing careers of 4 or 5 fabulous African American backup singers.  Most of them started in the 1960s and were backup singers on some of the most famous records of all time.  In a couple of instances, they even sang the lead on some hits but the credit was given to other singers who did not sing on the record at all.  These women are legendary within the music industry and certainly have the talent to be stars, but why haven't they?  The documentary tries to answer this question by interviewing big named stars that have used these ladies on their own records over the years.  The film features a lot of great music, and it makes you think about how many extremely talented people there are in the music industry and yet never become stars, and yet many of the pop stars of today can't sing at all and have to lip sync when they perform.  Highly recommended."" ]"

There is a lot of action in the film, and it is one of the loudest movies I have ever attended. Most of the action sequences went on a little too long for me, especially with the dragon in the last 1/2 hour, but there is no question it is a better film than the first installment of the series. The battle scenes are all preposterous, of course. You must go into the film knowing the Dwarfs will face epic battles against great odds but no good guys will die. I also had an issue understanding about 20% of the dialogue with all the noise and synthesized voices, a problem very common in today's special effects extravaganzas."" ]"
american-hustle;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I'm surprised at all the love given to this film.  The acting?  Superb throughout.  The story, however, was a little boring at times, and there really is no character you can root for.  Also, many critics are saying it is a comedy, and I chuckled a few times but neither I or the packed theater I saw it with laughed all that much.  In the end, the great acting throughout made it a passable film, but it does not have the repeatability factor for me.  I have no desire to see it again.  As a footnote, Jennifer Lawrence may be the best actress in Hollywood.  The movie came to life every time she was on the screen."" ]"

I guess you either enjoy the low brow humor of the minions or you don't.  I think they are hilarious.  The 3D is better than average, and at the end of the film while the credits are rolling they feature clips with the minions where the 3D really shines.  The animation is really excellent looking throughout.  It isn't quite up there with the best of Pixar, or even \""How To Train Your Dragon\"", or \""Kung Fu Panda\"", but it's close."" ]"

The animation is excellent, the 3D is excellent, but for me it wasn't funny enough to elevate it to greatness.  They also copied a little from \""Tangled\"", a superior film.  Tangled was funnier and had better songs.  As you might recall, Tangled had the comical horse.  Frozen has a moose with the same personality (but not quite as funny).  The Mickey Mouse short at the beginning was excellent, especially in 3D."" ]"

When the film ends you might be scratching your head and asking what certain people or events had to do with the plot.  I know I have several unanswered questions.  Still, this film was about 2 1/2 hours and I never looked at my watch.  I thought the acting was superb across the board, and the pacing excellent.  Good film to watch during Halloween time because it is creepy for sure."" ]"

She is watched like a hawk by authorities as someone who possibly may try to escape.  In the meantime, she is plotting an escape with her boyfriend who occasionally has to come to the East side of the wall for his work.  The depiction of the hospital and her living quarters is so stark and realistic.  She also begins to have feelings for her colleague Andre, who is apparently head of staff at the hospital.  The ending is not what you would expect.  The acting is great, and the cinematography is first rate.  The movie is German, so there are subtitles, but it is a slow paced film and the subtitles are easy to follow and don't detract.  Nina Hoss is wonderful in the title role and the film is sure to be a contender for best foreign film at Oscar time.  Highly recommended."" ]"
the-croods;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Dreamworks is making some great animation, and is currently better than Pixar.  The last two Pixar films (Cars2, Brave) were duds.  The animation and 3D of The Croods is excellent.  There are imaginative looking creatures all along the way, and the pacing is frenetic and funny.  It isn't quite as good as How to Train Your Dragon (so far their masterpiece) but it's close.  I thought it would bother me that they used Nicolas Cage as the voice of the father because his voice is so distinctive that it would be distracting, but it didn't turn out that way.  All the voice actors do a fine job."" ]"
bless-me-ultima;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""If you're tired of the usual Hollywood loud special effects films, or the extended bad sit-com movies, this might be an option for you.  Slow paced and dialogue driven, spiritual, and completely watchable.  The success of the entire movie depends on child actor Luke Ganalon, and he does an excellent job in the title role.  One day an elderly medicine woman (a \""Curandera\"") arrives at young Antonio's home to spend the final days of her life, and there is an instant bond between the two.  She teaches him the ways of her healing and magic, and the special relationship Man shares with the earth.  Curanderas are both revered and feared in their culture, and she is seen as an evil witch by some.  The only problem I had with the movie is that it is narrated by the older Antonio in parts, and it is never explained who he has become as an adult.  Still, a well done film."" ]"
the-impossible;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""The 5 members of this family seem real. I teared up several times. Kudos to the director who gets realistic performances from all the actors. It is particularly difficult to get good performances from children but he managed it. It is Naomi Watts, however, that is the centerpiece. The main crux of the film follows her and the oldest son on the path to safety. The Tsunami seemed real, and there is a cast of thousands around the hospital. Not sure how they filmed it but it is quite an achievement. I'm not sure I would ever want to see the film again - much of it is hard to watch, but overall a very affective film that I thought about long after the final credits.  Lastly, I would like to mention that the entire movie was given away in the trailer I saw for this movie which is a shame.  There is an art to making a trailer that makes you want to see the movie without giving too much away and more and more movies are giving away too much of the plot."" ]"

I'm docking 1 point for excessive violence which at times was WAY over the top.  I know QT loves violence in his films but really, I couldn't watch the scene with the dogs or the Mandingo fight.  There is also a scene discussing KKK hoods that seems right out of a Mel Brooks movie rather than Tarantino but it was hilarious.  For me, Christoph Waltz was the best thing about the whole movie.  I hope he and Tarantino continue to do more films together - it's a perfect match.  The film may have been written for Waltz as he is a German actor, and speaking German is a key component of the film.  There are strong performances from DiCaprio and Jackson as well.  Great directors get great performances from their cast.  All in all, a great combination of humor and violence, plus a strong depiction of slavery and its atrocities."" ]"
silver-linings-playbook;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""I loved this film.  A perfect balance between humor, drama, and quirkiness.  I thought the chemistry between Pat and Tiffany was through the roof.

I laughed every time his mother said it.  Pat and Tiffany's discussion about all the meds they've taken was hilarious.  I laughed a lot during the film and was rooting for these two to get together right from the start.  The best romantic comedy I've seen in years.

argo;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Argo starts interesting and gets better as it goes along.  A couple of things were confusing to me, however.  The Iranians were holding 52 Americans hostage.  Why was it so important to them to see if any had escaped during the takeover?  Why couldn't they simply get that information from the Americans they were holding hostage instead of having to piece together shredded documents?  I also couldn't quite figure out why we had to know that Ben Affleck had a son from a prior marriage - that part seemed tacked on and was never relevant.  Lastly, when the group entered the airport they all had a scared \""deer in the headlights\"" look.  If they were pretending to be filmmakers why weren't they all coached to talk to each other like people normally would?  The final chase scene on the tarmac is over the top Hollywood for sure but exciting nonetheless.  Overall a good film with some flaws."" ]"

A fascinating look at the political process of the time, some of which is still relevant today.  Well written and acted with great supporting roles, it never bored me.  They use some of the dialect of the time so I didn't always understand what was said, but it isn't hard to follow.  Tommy Lee Jones was great as usual.  I'm sure there will be lots of buzz at Oscar time.  The best Spielberg movie in a long time."" ]"
flight;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""I wanted to take a shower after this movie.  The snorting, shooting up, drinking, more drinking, and general drug abuse is hard to watch.  The acting and writing throughout is excellent, with especially noteworthy cameos from John Goodman as the drug pusher and James Badge Dale as a cancer patient.  Denzel is solid throughout as he always is.  The special effects (the plane crash) looked real and was intense.  Overall I thought the movie was a little predictable, and was such a downer that it loses the repeatability factor - I have no desire to ever see it again."" ]"
arthur-christmas;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Being a big fan of Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run I had to see this film.  I enjoyed it, although not as much as the critics.  There really were no big laughs, but there are many small ones.  The most impressive thing about the film are the visuals, and the 3D is top notch as well.  The worse part of the film is that most, if not all of the characters have an English accent and my friends and I couldn't decipher some of the things they said.  I also noticed kids getting restless in the theater, so this might be hard for younger kids to follow.  Before the movie I had to suffer through a Justin Bieber video who is trying to be a cross between Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson, but with a much worse voice."" ]"
looper;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I love Sci Fi, and like all the actors in this film, so I was looking forward to seeing it.  It was a mixed bag for me.  The film kept me interested, but turned out to be more about the telekinetic kid than anything else.  The child, played by Pierce Gagnon, is one of the best child performances I've ever seen in a film.  He is absolutely mesmerizing.  Unfortunately, the film ended up feeling more like a \""demon seed\"" scary film rather than an intriguing Sci Fi film.  I did not care for the whole telekinesis angle which seemed tacked on, and there is a sex scene in the film which was ridiculous and unnecessary.  There was also inconsistencies which made no sense.  The younger looper always shot and killed the future loopers the instance they appeared, and for some unexplained reason when the older version of himself appeared he hesitated before shooting.  There was also some very slow moments throughout the film.  Not a bad film, but it won't be a Blu Ray purchase."" ]"
men-in-black-iii;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""My expectations were low, as I did not like the second movie in this franchise, plus as a rule of thumb I do not like time travel movies.  I ended up liking this one as much as the first.  There was a lot of humor, and the special effects were good.  Josh Brolin does a great job of playing the young Tommy Lee Jones, and the chemistry is good.  I also liked the bad guy.  The movie isn't perfect - there are scenes that you've seen before in other movies that are overdone, but it had a sentimental twist at the end that really worked.  Overall I enjoyed it."" ]"
safe;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The plot is old school Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry, but with a lot more violence.  Bad cops, Asian Mafia, Russian Mafia, can't trust anybody, etc etc etc.  However, the action scenes are riveting and there are a lot of them.  The director uses the dreaded motion camera, but you can still see what's going on in most of the scenes.  I feel Jason Stathom is the Clint Eastwood of action films, a man of few words, but talks with his fists and facial expressions.  Clint was criticized a lot for making the same film over and over, but I felt every movie he did was entertaining in its own way, and I feel that way about Jason Stathom.  This is a well done, entertaining film."" ]"
the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Parts of the story you've seen many times before and are predictable (the romance between the hotel's owner and his girlfriend comes to mind) but most of the movie is fresh and eminently watchable.  The acting is superb across the board as you would expect with a cast of this magnitude.  The storyline of Tom Wilkinson's character is especially moving.  The exotic location of India and it's wonderful people make you want to visit the country.  Overall a nice movie-going experience."" ]"
bernie;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Jack Black was born to play Bernie Tiede, the town Funeral Director in Carthage, Texas.  He plays the guy who comes to town and steals all the old ladies hearts to perfection.  He sings pretty good also which he showcases many times throughout the film.  He befriends the town's most hated woman (played deliciously by Shirley MacClaine), then she takes complete control over him causing him to, well, you have to see it for yourself.  I haven't attended a film where the entire audience was involved and laughing like this in a long time.  Most of the theater clapped at the end and stayed for the entire end of the credits.  The interviews with all the town's inhabitants are hilarious.  Matthew McConaughey hams it up as the local D.A.  I really enjoyed this quirky, campy film."" ]"
the-artist;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I love Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, so I was looking forward to this modern homage to the silent films of old.  I found the film to be charming, but it was predictable and not as funny as I had hoped.  The reason Chaplin and Keaton were so great was because of their great physical comedy which required unbelievable timing.  This film has little to none of that, just a simple story with a few chuckles here and there.  The best things about the film for me were the dog and the soundtrack.  The music fit the scenes perfectly.  The acting and cinematography are very good but I would have preferred a more comedic script and more physical comedy."" ]"
clash-of-the-titans-2;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""\""Wrath\"" is much better than \""Clash\"".  The 3D for Clash is the worse I have ever seen, and they cleaned it up for this version.  The special effects are excellent throughout which is also an improvement from the first installment.  The pacing is good, it is never slow.  The biggest drawbacks are the accents that some of the actors have, particularly Sam Worthington.  I can't understand half the things he says, and he is the main character.  Another problem is the HORRIBLE \""Shaky Cam\"" throughout the movie.  Better take a motion sickness pill before this one.  You can't see what is going on in any of the major fight scenes.  Overall it was a mindless, fun action picture, and a pretty good one at that."" ]"
the-woman-in-black;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Wow - this is one angry ghost!  The story is typical of a haunted house film, but the look and atmosphere is much better than usual.  There were definitely scenes that gave me chills and goosebumps.  The director uses the technique of being very quiet then a sudden scream and face or ghost will turn up out of nowhere to scare you, but it works even though it's predictable.  No gore, just sudden loud moments where things pop out at you.  My friend and I both liked the film and thought it was entertaining.  Daniel Radcliffe plays the part well - the actual star of the film is the house and atmosphere.  Any decent actor could do the role."" ]"
chronicle-2012;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""You have to put up with the eye rolling teenage behavior that only Hollywood perceives teenagers to be, and of course the horrible moving camera, but it turns out to be an entertaining film.  The movie progressively gets better and better as it goes on so be patient.  I thought the special effects, for the most part, were great.  They could have made the teenagers a little more likable so that you cared more about the characters and their predicament, but for the most part they are annoying.  Still, I enjoyed it."" ]"
the-descendants;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Although I didn't enjoy this movie as much as Sideways, it is still an enjoyable slice of life.  The pace is slow and a little too even-keeled, but the acting is good throughout.  I also thought it was just a little too predictable.  I was a little disappointed by all the cussing throughout the film and I'm not a prude.  I just thought it was unnecessary.  The scenery was beautiful, of course, as it is set and filmed in Hawaii, and the Hawaiian soundtrack almost lulls you to sleep at times.  Overall I enjoyed it but I don't think it's the best movie I've seen this year."" ]"
the-adventures-of-tintin;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Motion Capture technology keeps improving, and the characters in this latest film don't look as creepy as they do in other movies using it (such as Polar Express).  Spielberg is channeling his \""Indiana Jones\"" phase, with the same type of chase scenes he used in those films.  Remember the scene in the second Indiana Jones film where they are kicking around a bottle on the dance floor?  He uses the same formula here with pieces of a clue only it goes on a little too long.  The 3D animation looks great, the pace is good.  I would have preferred more humor and less action but still enjoyed it.  Spielberg has even hired John Williams to do the soundtrack and you will hear similarities to Indiana Jones during some of the chase scenes.  Overall a good effort and the ending sets up a sequel which I will look forward to."" ]"
war-horse;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""There is an old movie called the Yellow Rolls Royce, where you see the various owners during the life of the car.  At one point the car is used in the war to transport soldiers.  This movie is basically the same plot but with a horse.  I was expecting a sappy family film based on the trailer, but instead saw a shockingly graphic war film.  This film is definitely not for kids.  Although the acting is good throughout, the star is the horse Joey.  The cinematography set in Devon, England is gorgeous.  You will wonder how he filmed some of the scenes with the horse.  When the horse falls, or gets intertwined in barbed wire it looks absolutely real, and horrifying.  As I stated, take kids at your discretion, I do not recommend it.  Although this is not a great Spielberg film such as Close Encounters or E.T., it is a good one and held my attention throughout."" ]"
the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The whole point of making the film for English audiences is so we can watch the movie with people speaking English.  So what do they do?  Make all the actors have a thick accent and mumble the lines so they are hard to understand.  I would say I missed about 20% of the dialogue due to poor enunciation and bad recording, not to mention the irritating loud electronic soundtrack which drowns out some of the dialogue as well.  There is a large cast of characters and it is important to hear what they are saying so you can keep up with the story.  Still, the acting was good to great (Rooney Mara is especially noteworthy) and the story was good.  I felt it was one of those never-ending movies, where you think it's over but it continues on.  Overall a solid movie, but not as good as others in the genre such as Silence of the Lambs."" ]"
mission-impossible---ghost-protocol;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Release all sense of logic, just sit back and enjoy all the over the top action sequences.  There isn't a dull moment in this edge-of-your-seat thriller.  All the high tech gadgets are fun and probably the closest nod to the original TV show.  The best was the screen of illusion in a hallway in the Kremlin, which is also the quietest scene in the movie.  Never a dull moment in this well made thriller.  Creative and fun and the cast seems to be having a good time as there is good chemistry in this gang of four.  You can talk with your friends afterwards for a good half hour at all the preposterous illogical sequences and that's part of the fun.  It's not meant to be believable, it's meant to be a good time at the theater."" ]"
the-ides-of-march;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Good solid film with very good performances.  It isn't great - I don't want to run out and buy the blu-ray when it becomes available, but it was entertaining.  I just wish the writers would have come up with something other than the obvious soapy twist about someone getting caught sleeping with someone else.  Ho hum.  Too predictable.  Still, really good performances all around."" ]"
moneyball;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Yet another sports film, but at least it isn't about boxing like the last few.  The story is simple, manager Billy Beane of the Oakland Athletics decides to put together a team of supposed misfits using statistical analysis instead of the usual methods because their small market team can't afford the expensive players.  There is a side story showing him with his daughter that adds absolutely nothing to the movie at all - I guess it was put in there to try and get women to see the movie.  It is well written and acted throughout, although there are slow moments.  I have to say, however, I was really happy at the ending.  For most sports movies there is a team or person who is considered the underdog and they come back and win it at the end.  That did not happen here (not a spoiler since the story is based on a real happening and the Oakland Athletics did not win that year).  Overall a decent day at the movies but won't be a blu-ray purchase for me later."" ]"
midnight-in-paris;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Being a huge Woody Allen fan I had to go see this movie even though, as I write this, it is in limited release.  That means driving about 30 miles for me.  Was it worth it?  Yes.  Woody has made many successful \""fantasy\"" films in the past (A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Alice to name a few) and I love all of them.  I haven't been a big Owen Wilson fan in the past, but he does a great job in the Woody role for this film.  You can't help but think of Woody when hearing this dialogue, however, because it is so similar to other Woody films.  I'm not going to give away any of the plot except to say that something magical happens at Midnight, and Gil (the Owen Wilson Character) learns about his current life from the experiences.  Everyone in the movie is wonderful.  Woody is one of those directors that is capable of getting the absolute best out of actors.  Woody is on a role lately with Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Match Point and Whatever Works being excellent films."" ]"
the-debt;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Although Helen Mirren, CiarÃ¡n Hinds and Tom Wilkinson get top billing because of their star power, they are actually the supporting cast.  Most of the film is about the three young actors that play them 30 years ago.  They go to communist East Germany to capture a former Concentration Camp torturer so they can take him back to Israel for trials for his misdeeds, but they bungle the kidnapping.  I thought the film was well acted and it held my attention the entire time.  The only problem I had was that the older actors looked NOTHING like they younger ones with the exception of Helen Mirren.  They should have found actors that at least looked similar to each other.  Some of this film is not easy to watch, particularily the Gynecologist scenes so be prepared.  It deserves its R rating."" ]"
kung-fu-panda-2;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The original Kung Fu Panda was more sophisticated in its humor making it very enjoyable for adults as well as kids.  It was also funnier, and didn't have quite so many fight scenes.  The producers have fallen into the Hollywood trap of having as much action as possible.  It needed more quiet moments like in the first film.  Still, it was entertaining and looked great, although the 3D was not worth it.  The entire time I was wishing I was watching it in the bright 2D instead of the dull, dark 3D.  It will make the Blu-Ray all that more exciting to watch I suppose.  Overall good, but disappointing considering the first one was so great."" ]"
warrior;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Good movie but I felt like I was watching Rocky 6.  Soap opera setup for the big match that could only happen in the movies - brother against brother for a 5 million dollar purse, winner take all.  All performances are good but Tom Hardy is the standout.  If it had any originality it would be a great movie but we've seen it all before.  Still, it held my attention and the characters were interesting.  As far as the fight scenes go, get ready for the moving queasy cam.  This director likes the horrible technique of moving the camera around so much you can't always see what's happening.  It's just a lazy technique Hollywood uses to fool the audience into thinking more is going on than your eyes can see.  Overall good but not great."" ]"
the-hunger-games;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""\""The Hunger Games\"" was one of my favorite books of recent years, and I thought the movie was very faithful to the book. Jennifer Lawrence in particular was perfect as Katniss. It is true, as some reviewers state, that the movie leaves a lot of the back story of Katniss and Peeta out, but there is enough in the flashbacks so viewers get the idea. At first I thought Josh Hutcherson was wrong for the Peeta role, but he won me over with his performance. Overall a very good adaptation of a very good book. Anytime you make a movie of a beloved book it can never live up to some people's expectations. I thought they did a great job.  My only major criticism would be the ever moving motion of the camera.  I really hate this stupid technique that directors are using these days.  You can get motion sick at the movies and it's annoying."" ]"
the-hangover-part-ii;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I laughed a lot at this movie.  Yes, the premise is the same as the first one, but the gags were different and I was entertained the whole way.  If I were seeing this film without seeing the first one I would rate it a little higher, but because the characters aren't new and fresh anymore it isn't as good as the first one.  There were a couple of hilarious scenes, a lot of mildly amusing scenes, and it has a monkey.  Who smokes.  I never expect sequels to be as good as the originals so maybe I went into it with lower expectations than other people, but I thought it was a success.  Did I mention it has a monkey?  :)"" ]"
cowboys-aliens;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""If you believe in aliens, then you know they have been around and visited the planet in other times, so why not a movie about them visiting earth during the wild west period?  Makes sense to me.  The movie works because it is played straight up, no camp, no comedy.  I liked the first half of the movie better than the second half when it turns into your basic alien shoot-em-up, but it is still attention grabbing and fun even then.  I do get tired of Hollywood portraying aliens as slobbery, dripping beasts with fangs and claws that don't even verbally communicate with one another, but I guess we're stuck with that.  You also have to open your mind to other silliness such as the aliens using a lasso to capture their victims while flying in their saucers at high speed.  Seems kind of low-tech for such a superior being.  Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are terrific and the supporting cast is at their level as well.  Overall an entertaining summer movie."" ]"
unstoppable;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Yes, it's predictable.  No, there will be no academy awards for acting.  But, if you want a good time at the movies it is totally successful.  I think the best part of the film was actually the soundtrack and of course the special effects.  These trains SOUND like trains and the wrecks look realistic.  Really a fun movie and definitely not boring.  I will purchase this one on blu-ray when it's released because it looks and sounds great."" ]"
tangled;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""I went to this movie with fairly low expectations because I thought \""The Princess and the Frog\"" from last year was mediocre.  I love animation so I check out most releases.  This turned out to be Disney's best feature in awhile.  It certainly helped that the music was WAY better than the Frog movie.  The humor is elevated high enough for both children and adults to enjoy, and some of the animation is amazing - particularily the scene where they let go of the lanterns while on the boat.  At first you might roll your eyes at all the impossible tasks the princess can do with her hair, but after awhile you just go with it.  It is a fairy tale after all.  The movie doesn't quite reach the level of \""Toy Story 3\"" or \""How to Train Your Dragon\"", but it's very close."" ]"
shrek-forever-after;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Although I love animation, I've never been a fan of the Shrek franchise.  This movie took me by surprise.  The first Shrek movie was good (not great) thanks to Eddie Murphy, but Shrek 2 was awful.  I never saw the 3rd installment.  I've never liked the weird Irish accent for Shrek that Mike Myers provides.  It doesn't fit for me and I find it distracting.  Why is he Irish when nobody else is?  My friend talked me into going to see this one and it turned out to be a good animated movie - maybe even the best of the Shrek movies.  The script is WAY better than Shrek 2 and had some good laughs and good animation and it held my attention the entire way.  The 3D was good, not great, and probably not worth the extra cost, as 3D mutes the colors due to the dark glasses."" ]"
knight-and-day;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Remember Kate Capshaw in the second Raiders of the Lost Ark movie?  She constantly ran around screaming hysterically like a Banshee and ruined the movie?  Well, Cameron Diaz is channeling her in this movie.  She's a little too much BUT not to the extreme that Kate Capshaw was, and thankfully Tom Cruise is good as usual, and the two do have some chemistry.  Not a great film, but never boring and completely watchable."" ]"
sex-and-the-city-2;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""People don't seem to get Sex and the City 2.  The creators wanted to make something over the top silly and fun, and the movie succeeded.  Yes, it has some eye rolling moments, but this movie is pure escapism similar to old movies from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  I laughed a lot at this film, and the scene where Charlotte and Miranda talk about parenthood in the bar is one of the best dramatic and funny moments in cinema this year.  Also, I don't think these critics were true fans of the original HBO show.  That series definitely had some silly moments as well.  I don't think the movies have been that different from the TV show.  I hope they make more sequels!  There!  I said it and feel EXHILARATED!"" ]"

The action scenes are great, the movie is well written, and it probably has the best usage of 3D that I've seen so far.  After these two gems, Dreamworks is almost at the level of Pixar, who I think slipped a little after last year's \""Up\"".  Pixar still makes the most original films, however.  This one does have the tired storyline of the protagonist that nobody respects suddenly becoming a hero, just like Kung Fu Panda.  Once Dreamworks does something totally original, such as \""Toy Story\"", or \""Monster's Inc\"", they will be at the level of Pixar."" ]"
toy-story-3;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""Toy Story 3 edges out \""How to Train Your Dragon\"" for best animated movie of the year.  It's my favorite Pixar film since \""Ratatouille\"".  You would think some staleness would start to set in since this is the third Toy Story, but not so.  Not only is Pixar the best at writing original scripts for animation, they are the best at getting great performances from the voice actors.  These characters have real personalities.  The dialogue is realistic, the pace frantic.  LOVE the mean cymbal playing monkey!  That was the biggest laugh I've had at the movies in awhile.  The ending was perfect."" ]"
fantastic-mr-fox;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""Wes Anderson instantly became one of my favorite directors after seeing this great animated film.  His quirky style was perfect for this story, and voice-overs were outstanding.  Clooney in particular was brilliant.  I am a huge fan of animation and I usually don't like it when I recognize an actor's voice because I only think of the actor while watching the film, but in this case the famous actors (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray) became the characters they voiced and were perfect.  The music was also brilliant throughout.  I hope Wes Anderson makes more animated films in the future.  BRILLIANT!"" ]"
inception;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""The trailer for the film was fantastic, and the fact that Chris Nolan directed it reeled me in.  I couldn't wait to see it.  When I saw it, I liked it but didn't love it like so many others.  I tend to see things black or white, so the story that so many people have blogged and argued and were confused about seemed pretty straight forward to me.  In fact, the characters explain what is going to happen when they are inside a dream, then when they dream it does happen.  Another problem I had with the film is that I didn't care about any of the characters, so I didn't care if they died or not.  A better film than this one in the same genre would be \""Dark City\"".  That one blew my mind AND I cared about the characters.  I also thought the loud soundtrack sometimes muted the dialogue.  Overall a good film with great special effects that might get better for me with repeated viewings."" ]"

In the future humans are controlled by medications, and unbeknown to THX his female roommate is slowly removing the pills.  He starts feeling emotions like love and lust that he never felt before and he and his roommate start having sex which is not permitted.  I was amazed at how cool the sets were for a film made on low budget in 1970.  I really enjoyed this film."" ]"
pi;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is one of those atmospheric, creepy movies that grabs you and doesn't let go.  I seem to love (The Wrestler, Pi) or hate (Black Swan, The Fountain) Aronofsky's films, but admire the visuals even in the ones I don't like.  I always look forward to seeing his next film, and I can't say that about every director.  The lead in this film,  Sean Gullette, is excellent, as is the rest of the cast.  I really liked the camera work and LOVED the soundtrack with the creepy noises throughout.  The story, how everything in the universe can be explained by mathematics was intriguing.  I really enjoyed the film and would watch it again."" ]"
whatever-works;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""I'm a huge Woody Allen fan and I think this is the best film he's done since his 80's heydays. Larry David is brilliant and I was laughing right from the start and kept laughing throughout. Some people were turned off by the pessimism and sarcasm of the Larry David character, but I thought he was hilarious. Even the other characters in the film ignored him and didn't take him seriously.  I liked it even better than Vicki Christina Barcelona or Point Blank - the other two great recent Woody films."" ]"
the-social-network;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is one of the few films I've ever seen that was riveting even though I disliked the main character.  Just goes to show that if a movie is made well it will be totally watchable no matter what.  I'm not sure this film has the repeatable factor for me as far as the story goes, so don't know if I'll buy the Blu-Ray at this point (thus the 9 instead of a 10), but I was absorbed the first time I saw it and couldn't wait to see how it turned out at the end.  This is film-making at its finest."" ]"
ponyo;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and have seen all his movies.  This is one of his more gentle fantasies like \""Kiki's Delivery Service\"" or \""My Neighbor Tortoro\"".  I enjoyed the political incorrectness throughout the film (the mother is a horrible driver, plus she leaves her 5 year old alone at home during a monster storm so she can drive to the senior center to check on their safety).  The real star of the film, however, is the fantastic drawings and color palettes.  This might be his most colorful movie he's made, and when you consider this is drawn and not computer generated some of the scenes are jaw dropping.  When you have a lot of fish in a single scene and each one is doing its own thing it must be a nightmare to animate.  Some of his movies can be a little preachy about the environment and balance of nature, but this one isn't too bad.  I do wish that animators would not use voices that are so distinctive.  Liam Neeson and Betty White have such distinctive voices that as soon as the character starts speaking, you immediately think of the actor.  I'm sure that was a Disney decision, plus actors want to voice in a Miyazaki film much like actors want to be in a Woody Allen Film because they recognize greatness.  This isn't a classic like \""Spirited Away\"", but if you're a Miyazaki fan you will probably enjoy it."" ]"
the-kids-are-all-right;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""I really liked this film, but a couple of things that happen seem unrealistic to me which keeps me from elevating the film to a 9 or 10.  First is the relationship between Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo - I don't think that would happen in real life.  Second, and most importantly, is the way the family treats the Mark Ruffalo character at the end.  The acting, however, is great all around, especially by Annette Bening.  She should lock up an Oscar nomination for sure."" ]"
red;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This movie is everything the trailer suggests it will be.  A funny, somewhat campy romp where the old guys outwit the younger ones.  The funniest part for me was seeing Helen Mirren in her formal dress shooting at the enemy on a humongous machine gun on a tripod in a parking garage.  It just looked funny.  Malkovich played the eccentric quirky personality to perfection and had some funny lines.  The movie was not meant to be taken seriously, but instead be a good entertaining diversion and it succeeds.  I also thought Bruce Willis showed some of his playful side (ala moonlighting) that I haven't seen from him in awhile."" ]"

I knew that Firth and Rush would be great together, but I was taken by surprise by the cinematography as well.  It was fun being inside the castles and palaces.  Colin Firth is really on a roll lately, Geoffrey Rush is amazing as always, and the supporting cast is as good as it gets.  Highly recommended."" ]"
the-adjustment-bureau;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""For me, this movie was a throwback to simple fantasy films of yesteryear.  It isn't meant to be a deep, complex movie like The Matrix or Inception.  It is simply a romantic comedy fantasy.  The film would not work if there were no chemistry between the two leads, but that is not a problem.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have great chemistry together, and I was rooting for them to be together the entire film.  I thought the film was fun, and unlike some of the other people reviewing this film I was never bored."" ]"
thor;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""First and foremost, I have never been a big fan of superhero movies.  I hated the Spiderman movies, liked but didn't love the Batman films, liked but didn't love the hulk movies, liked the first Iron man, hated the second.  But this film really looked and felt like a comic book to me, which is the whole point.  Most importantly, it actually had HUMOR.  How refreshing.  The special effects were great.  There were moments where the background looked drawn, especially Thor's world (or realm as he called it), but that added to the \""comic book\"" feel to me.  I saw it in Digital IMAX 3D, and it looked fantastic.  I can take or leave 3D but love IMAX so the 3D just came along for the ride.  At first the Natalie Portman character seems thrown in for the inevitable Hollywood love interest, but in the end I liked that he fell in love with a mortal from earth, and it sets up the sequel.  Newcomer Chris Hemsworth is terrific, and all the supporting acting is up to par.  Lots of action in the film - you won't be bored."" ]"
rango;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I'm giving it a 7 based on the fantastic visuals, otherwise it would be closer to a 5.  I saw this in a theater that was almost full and kids were bored and making noise the entire time so I don't recommend it for kids.  The biggest problem for me was the lack of humor.  The film will keep your attention because of the great animation, but this could have been great if the movie was funnier.  The script writers also pay homage to many other movies, (Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, High Noon and many more) by copying the most famous scenes from those movies.  The actors doing the voices do a great job.  Overall, a good animated film aimed at adults, but not enough humor to make it a classic."" ]"
fast-five;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This movie fits in well with the others in the series.  It is a well made action flick with great special effects that you will forget entirely in a couple of months.  The best part of the movie is the opening train sequence.  The cars pulling the safe at the end (not a spoiler since it is in the previews) will have you rolling your eyes in disbelief, but it is still exciting.  The Rock actually gives one of his best screen performances to date.  Not great but a fun movie."" ]"
bridesmaids;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""This movie proves that women can succeed with low-brow bathroom humor as well as the guys.  The movie seems to meander a bit in parts and seems unfocused, but gets back on track.  It could have used a little more editing.  BUT, when it was funny it was really, really funny.  The scene in the posh store when they are trying on wedding dresses was hilarious.  Not quite as good as The Hangover as an ensemble piece.  A couple of the bridesmaids are barely used and forgettable, so the chemistry as a group is not always there, but funny anyway.  A good comedy."" ]"
the-help;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""The good performances outweigh the flaws in this film.  All the main character performances are excellent.  The rest of the cast are interchangeable bigoted caricatures, which gives the film a feeling of unrealism at times.  My mother was born and raised in Mississippi and I can tell you not all southerners felt the way the bigots in this film do, although watching this film you wouldn't know that.  It would have been nice to have one or two more women, other than Skeeter (the main character), rebel against these atrocities.  I thought they were going to do that with the Celia character but she never really develops enough.  Still, the acting is great and you really feel for these people and root for them.  This is the kind of movie that Oscars love.  I just hope they don't forget Bryce Dallas Howard's fantastic performance as the hateful bigot, she was fantastic.  Many times the hateful people in films get ignored at Oscar time.  Lastly, if you are into interior design you will enjoy looking at the 1960s designs of the home's interiors.  They did a great job of set design.  It's kind of funny looking at the cars because they are all pristine!  Since they had to use restored cars from that time period there isn't a speck of dust on them!"" ]"

I cared about all the characters, even though the Rogen character was a little close to being over the top.  Levitt is absolutely perfect as the cancer stricken person holding all his emotions in, until he finally explodes the night before his surgery.  I haven't cried at a movie in years but definitely teared up at this one.  I'm glad the time of the year has arrived when the good movies are shown.  Highly recommended.  Deserves the great reviews it's getting."" ]"
pariah;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Adepero Oduye is wonderful as Alike, and the rest of the cast is wonderful as well.  A good coming out story.  You would think that gays and lesbians would be accepted by their parents in this day and age, but we are apparently still a long way off.  This movie has been done before many times with gay males, it was refreshing to see the lesbian version from a black family of intelligent, yet dysfunctional people.  Although it is mostly drama, there are humorous scenes as well."" ]"
melancholia;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is the best film I saw all year, and I go to the movies a lot. The first hour of the film (the wedding reception) is uncomfortable and even irritating to sit through. This is purposeful by the filmmaker.  He even uses the \""ever moving camera\"" technique that I wish filmmakers would stop using once and for all.  I should not have to take a motion sick pill before going to a movie.  We find out in the second half of the film, however, when it turns into a Science Fiction movie, why Justine (Kirsten Dunst) had such erratic behavior at her reception. The second half of the film is simply mesmerizing. Atmospheric, beautiful, scary, suspense building. Great visuals throughout the film - you will think about what you saw long after the film ends. Dunst is great in this film, but Charlotte Gainsbourg who plays her sister is equally wonderful. This film may not be mainstream enough to win awards at Oscar time, but it's not to be missed. I could write more about this great film, but I don't want to give anything away."" ]"
headhunters-2012;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""At first the protagonist is the bad guy, but you will soon be rooting for him.  This guy is like the Timex watch, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking.  There are difficult scenes that you will be watching through your fingers!  Very action packed, gory, and fun.  You're not sure who is trustworthy at first, even his wife is suspect.  A word of warning, it's a Norwegian film so you will have to read captions, and you will need to be a speed reader.  I'm sure I missed some of the action on the screen while I was reading the captions."" ]"
drive;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""What a strange movie.  People just stare at each other for what seems like hours before they speak, if they speak at all.  I thought the film was going to be driving and chase scenes, and there were a couple of those, but it is mostly a quasi mob movie.  It is VERY slow in parts.  It is strange seeing Albert Brooks in a mobster role.  Every time he spoke I thought of the father fish in Finding Nemo!  All the actors, including Brooks, do a good job, however.  There were some great scenes in the movie (the opening drive sequence, the motel shoot-out), and some ridiculous scenes (the mask, some of the dialogue, the music/songs, the elevator kiss, people's reactions to things), but at least the movie is different and not the usual predictable Hollywood fair.  Lastly, this is a very violent, gory movie.  It goes from very serene to explosive quickly.  Overall I recommend it, the good outweighs the bad."" ]"
moonrise-kingdom;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""I had to travel to L.A. (one hour) to see this film and it was worth it.  When I saw \""Fantastic Mr. Fox\"" I had a smile on my face the entire time, and this live action film captures the same quirkiness of that classic animated film.  I can't say enough about how great the two lead child actors this film are - Wes Anderson likes a certain style that requires both timing and a certain way of conversing, and everyone in the film captured it perfectly.  The story was kind of a modern day Huck Finn (although set in the 1960s).  I already look forward to his next film, and that is the best compliment I can give any director."" ]"
premium-rush;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""You will have a good time watching the film IF you can ignore all the implausibilities and over the top situations.  Example:  near the start of the film the bad guy is chasing a bicycle in New York gridlock traffic.  A bicycle would leave a car behind in it's dust in this situation as it can weave in and out between the cars, but somehow this car keeps remaining on his tail no matter what he does.  This is one small example of many other ludicrous situations.  You have to let it go and enjoy the high energy and exuberance of the film.  Although Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine in the lead role, the movie is stolen by Michael Shannon playing the bad cop.  He makes a good creepy bad guy.  If you like to see bicycles wipe out at full speed, you will really enjoy this movie."" ]"
frankenweenie;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Long live Whiskers the cat!  Loved that character!  Sometimes Burton's comedies aren't funny enough.  No problem with Frankenweenie.  I laughed a lot.  The stop motion animation is first rate.  The story is clever, especially when the animals get morphed together.  I like the decision to make it in black and white.  Good enough for repeated viewings, so I will be purchasing the blu ray when it's released.  This is my favorite Burton film since the underrated \""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\""."" ]"
prometheus;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""Wow, is this film gorgeous to look at.  Probably the best 3D I have seen as well.  I was NEVER bored during the movie and the time went by quickly.  I have never seen any scary film that didn't have people doing illogical things (including the earlier Alien films) and this film is no different, but I was still entertained throughout.  If you think about it, if these scientists really behaved like scientists the movie would be boring.  I really appreciated that the scary scenes didn't drag on and on and on and it didn't have any scenes where the bad guy just doesn't die, even when he should be dead (I HATE that).  The CGI is flawless throughout.  Personally, I think this film is a classic.  I was still thinking about it the next day after seeing it.  If this film doesn't win every Oscar for visual effects it will be a crime."" ]"
dredd;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Dirty Harry meets Robocop.  I really enjoyed this stark, graphic film.  The plot is simple, but it is done well and is entertaining.  It reminded me of a video game at times, but did have a comic book feel as well.  The 3D was done well.  If you're a fan of graphic violence and lots of things blowing up, you will enjoy it.  I really liked the overall grim look of the film and the action sequences, and even laughed at some of the extreme violence, especially the bad guy's head smoking and blowing up.  Watch out for Maw Maw!!!!"" ]"
rise-of-the-guardians;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Visually, the animation is outstanding.  Dreamworks already proved they were among the best animators with \""How to Train Your Dragon\"".  The 3D is also excellent.  Unfortunately, the story fell a little flat and predictable for me.  The moral of the movie, \""It's real if you only believe\"", has been done many times in movies, and as recently as \""Polar Express\"" a few years ago.  Polar Express was a better movie for me than this one.  Still, the outstanding visuals kept my interest the entire movie and I recommend it on that basis alone."" ]"
beautiful-creatures-2012;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""A friend of mine talked me into seeing this with him.  He knows I hate the Twilight franchise, and this seems like it's aimed for the same market, but I went anyway.  It turned out to be WAY better than Twilight.  The acting across the board was good, and the dialogue was believable.  It also had some humor throughout, unlike the over-dramatic melodrama of Twighlight.  Alden Ehrenreich was a charmer in the lead role, and the movie would not have been a success without him.  The film did feel a little rushed in its pacing towards the end, like they knew they had to wrap it up.  Overall, better than expected."" ]"
parker;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Being a Statham fan I had to see the latest entry.  I would rank it slightly better than average.  The plot is the standard where the protagonist is left for dead, then seeks revenge on all his betrayers.  We've seen this in other Statham movies, Clint Eastwood movies, and countless other \""revenge\"" action pictures.  It's a formula that works when done well.  The Jennifer Lopez character is really strange.  At first she is brave, willing to throw herself in a dangerous situation, then other times in the movie she is the stereotypical, overreacting hysterical female.  She seemed to have a split personality.  Recommended if your a fan of this genre."" ]"
man-of-steel;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Overall, despite all the eye rolling ludicrous moments and plot holes, I was entertained by this film.  The acting was good across the board, although I wasn't crazy about Michael Shannon's performance as the bad guy, General Zod.  Too one note.  I also get tired of people beating each other to a pulp only to get back up without a scratch on their body.  That is the norm in super hero movies, however.  I also felt the movie had one battle too many, and was way too destructive.  New York City is decimated in this film.  This film is LOUD!  The special effects were excellent and the 3D good.  Overall, a success, but not great."" ]"
life-of-pi;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""This film was truly \""movie magic\"".  Some of the visuals are astounding, and you will constantly ask yourself \""how did they do that?\"".  The film is well written and acted, and the 3D is the best I have seen in a non-animated film.  Do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen possible and definitely in 3D.  It even has an unexpected twist ending that I wasn't expecting (I didn't read the book).  This is the best film I have seen this year and I go to the movies a lot."" ]"
mud;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is the best film of the year so far.  The acting and writing is great, and the movie feels authentic.  I was never bored at the 2 hours and 5 minutes it took to watch it.  It is kind of a modern day Huck Finn story, with two boys helping a fugitive to escape.  The story mainly centers around Ellis, perfectly played by Tye Sheridan, who's world is changing with the impending divorce of his parents and his first crush on an older girl in town.  They live on a river boat and his parents have loose reins on his upbringing, which I appreciated.  He is free to live a very fun childhood with his best friend Neckbone, played excellently by Jacob Lofland.  Matthew McConaughey is also good as the fugitive.  If you like coming of age films like \""Stand By Me\"", you will like this one."" ]"
the-heat;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Even though the movie was completely predictable, Melissa McCarthy made me laugh quite a bit, so I am giving this movie a pass.  Sandra Bullock was also good as the nerdy straight man, or straight woman in this case.  I enjoyed their chemistry.  The movie also has some politically incorrect humor involving an albino, and a lot of other crude, low brow humor.  If you're at all prudish when it comes to profanity, stay away."" ]"
the-conjuring;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Amityville meets the Exorcist.  Although this movie is being hyped as one of the scariest ever, it wasn't that scary for me.  I hate gory films, and thankfully this film is not in that category.  You might scream from the suspense, but not from cheap gore.  The acting and writing is good across the board, and in general people don't do stupid things like walk into dark rooms without turning on lights, or back up to a window.  They pretty much behave normally with only one exception that I won't give away (it has to do with the mother and the cellar).  I had goosebumps throughout the movie and thought it had just enough of a scare factor to make it fun.  A nice creepy time at the movies."" ]"
nebraska;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""Nebraska is a slow, meandering quirky film that will appeal to anyone who likes that style of film.  I like the decision to film in Black and White which adds to the ambiance.  Although Bruce Dern will get a lot of attention for his portrayal of Woody, Will Forte is the glue that holds this film together.  His portrayal of as Woody's son David is pitch perfect as someone who at first feels distant from his father, only to grow closer to him as he gets to know him (mostly through other people) on their road trip together.  Then there is June Squibb as David's mother, who is the source of most of the humor in the movie.  In fact, two of her scenes are the funniest moments I saw in any movie this year  she's a hoot!"" ]"
blue-jasmine;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""Although Woody is a great comedic filmmaker, my favorite films of his are the dramas.  This film is a throwback to the great 80's films of his like \""Interiors\"" and \""Another Woman\"".  Cate Blanchett is mesmerizing as a woman who has lived in a bubble, and cannot face the real world.  She is only comfortable in her unrealistic world as the wealthy trophy wife, and cannot function when the marriage tragically ends.  The supporting cast is superb, but this is Cate Blanchett's vehicle to take all the way to the Oscars.  LOVED the ending as well.  Perfection."" ]"
thor-the-dark-world;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""I guess this was the \""Empire Strikes Back\"" edition of the Thor franchise due to the death scene and the twist ending.  The movie started out poorly with one of the worse battle scenes I've seen for awhile, but when the bad guy comes back the film finally gets its groove.  The humor, or attempted humor generally comes from the Character Darcy, played by Kat Dennings, who is the assistant of the Natalie Portman character.  I found her to be somewhat annoying rather than funny, and she certainly does not act like a normal person in dire situations.  Still, the overall look of the film is excellent and once the film got into second gear I never got bored."" ]"
the-hunger-games-catching-fire;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""I read all three books.  I thought the first movie was very good, but this one was even better.  The director managed to capture the look I had in my head when I read the books and that is very rare for movies adapted from a book.  I also couldn't think of anything that was left out from the book  everything was covered.  The acting is solid across the board, with special kudos to Jennifer Lawrence who captures Katniss perfectly.  Can't wait to see the final movie of the trilogy."" ]"

I rolled my eyes throughout this film.  Even so, I admittedly have to say the movie is well made and acted and held my attention.  It isn't a movie I would ever want to view again but it was interesting.  Although there are a few chuckles, I would not categorize this film as a comedy, it definitely leans drama."" ]"

magic-in-the-moonlight;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is Woody-lite.  That isn't a bad thing.  Every now and then Woody makes a light, non-serious movie that is simply fun to watch.  I have loved most of them.  I enjoyed all the performances and the wonderful cinematography.  My biggest complaint was the ending, or more specifically the conclusion about whether the Medium (played by Emma Stone) was real or not.  It could have been even more magical as the title implies."" ]"
love-is-strange;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Love is Strange is made in the style of a Woody Allen drama, but not as strong as Woody's best work.  Lithgow and Molina are wonderful as the two geriatric gay men who have lived together nearly 40 years, only to have to separate temporarily when one of them loses their job.  They each move in with a different family member, and each one has different problems with their new living arrangements.  Some of the camera shots seemed exceedingly long to me, and some of the characters and storyline felt underdeveloped, but I still enjoyed the film overall.  Not a film I would want to see again, as the various family members were very annoying."" ]"
guardians-of-the-galaxy;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Guardians of the Galaxy is refreshing in its fun and sense of humor.  It is mainly a comedy.  Although some of the characters seemed familiar (the lead actor Chris Pratt is very similar to Han Solo in Star Wars), the humor and writing was fresh.  The humor doesn't always work, but the zingers come fast and furious to keep you grinning.  The look of the movie is excellent as well, although Hollywood still hasn't perfected the craft of making computer animated characters look completely real all the time (the raccoon in particular).  All in all, very enjoyable."" ]"
john-wick;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Keanu Reeves is the latest in a long list of stars to play the man of few words with a lot of action (Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Liam Neeson, Jason Stathom, etc).  The plot is razor thin, someone does him wrong and he seeks revenge.  The action is ludicrous but a lot of fun and the movie certainly never bores.  All the costars seem to be having fun in their roles as well.  Since it is the first Keanu Reeves success in a while I would think they will make a franchise out of it.  I will look forward to the next one."" ]"
gravity;9;3;Bikerjames;"[ ""This movie is all about the visuals.  Be sure you see it in 3D.  Sandra Bullock is excellent, although somewhat panicky for a highly trained astronaut.  Even at the beginning before disaster strikes she is having a panic attack.  The astronaut played by Clooney is a stereotype you've seen before, but it doesn't matter as Sandra Bullock is the main focus.  You will be asking yourself how they are doing the special effects all throughout the film because it looks so real.  I was on the edge of me seat the entire time."" ]"
the-imitation-game;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role.  I can't think of anyone that would be better in the part.  The movie is compelling but you can tell when Hollywood adds a part here and there for emotional impact and you feel a little manipulated.  His personality reminded me of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, so maybe they were taking advantage of his current popularity as well.  The other actors were all fine, but Cumberbatch really carries this film.  The film looks good, too."" ]"
kingsman-the-secret-service;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Although I enjoyed myself, I do think the film had some issues. The fast edited fight scenes go on way too long, it's really violent, and the film can't really decide if it's an all out comedy or drama. At times it has \""Airplane\"" type of humor, like it's making fun of the spy genre, and other times heavy on the drama. At one point they even poke fun of product placement in movies with McDonalds, again showing the \""Airplane\"" style of satirical humor.  Somehow it all worked for me mainly due to the spirited acting by everyone involved. Not really a film I would desire to see again but fun for an afternoon."" ]"
the-boxtrolls;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The animation is great, the voice characterizations excellent as well.  However, when I watch an animated film I expect to laugh.  I never laughed out loud once, only a chuckle here and there when the boy interacts with his fellow humans for the first time during a party.  In fact, I laughed more during the preview of the SpongeBob Squarepants movie before this movie started than I did for the entire Boxtroll film.  I'm sure you will be asking yourself the same question I did - how did this boy learn to speak perfect English since he was raised by trolls that don't speak English?  I also thought the filmmakers were trying to cash in on the Minion craze, and Minions are much funnier.  Still, I appreciated all the work put into the film and I didn't get bored so I give it a pass.  Barely."" ]"
run-all-night;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""The movie certainly gets an F for originality.  The latest Keanu Reeves movie John Wick, which just came out a few months ago, had the exact same plot.  It was also somewhat annoying that at the beginning of this film Liam Neeson plays a washed up, drunken ex-hit man who can barely function, yet when the action starts he suddenly transforms into a sober fighting machine that can beat up anyone.  It also has the obligatory over the top ridiculous car chase that is now standard fair in any movie of this type.  That said, when the action started, I was on the edge of my seat.  It was mostly entertaining and a fun afternoon at the movies."" ]"

The movie is well made, the action sequences are thrilling, and it was fun to see all the characters from the original trilogy.  But ultimately, the movie is a carbon copy of the first Star Wars film (episode 4), and was almost jaw dropping how it completely stole the story line from that film.  It was so predictable throughout that it ruined the scene where Han confronts his son, because you knew what was going to happen.  Ultimately I left the theater feeling disappointed.  I'm hoping the next one has an original plot."" ]"
mission-impossible---rogue-nation;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""This franchise just gets better with each movie.  The best part of the movie for me is the casting - everyone is perfect in their role.  The sets and the action sequences are terrific.  The Mission: Impossible movies have been much better than the latest Daniel Craig Bond films because they have a sense of humor.  The only downfall for me was the much dreaded \""countdown timer\"" that is so overused in these action films, and the fact that people with machine guns in short range can't hit their targets."" ]"
the-lady-in-the-van;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This film succeeds due to the acting chops of Maggie Smith and Alex Jennings.

the-martian;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""This was a better movie when it was made 20 years ago and called \""Apollo 13\"".  Seriously, if you have seen a lot of movies in your life you will have a lot of De-ja Vu while watching this film.  The Apollo 13 film had the exact same plot, someone stuck in space and we have to get them home, so there is constant interplay between the Astronaut and NASA on how they are going to fix the problems that constantly come up.  That doesn't mean I didn't like The Martian.  If you have Ridley Scott directing and Matt Damon starring chances are it's going to be well made.  I really loved the look of the film, and it did keep me interested for the entire 2 1/2 hours.  It's just not a film I would have a deep desire to see again."" ]"
the-revenant-2015;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""First and foremost, it's great to see Native Americans in a film again.  Not sure why we only see Native Americans in period pieces, but I'll take it.  The soundtrack for this film is exemplary.  Music and sounds that enhance the movie experience rather than detract from it like most movies.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  The acting is great throughout and DiCaprio might even be upstaged by Tom Hardy's excellent portrayal.  Although I've never witnessed an actual bear attack, this one looked realistic enough to make it very uncomfortable to watch.  The battles also looked realistic.  There are a few things in the film that didn't work for me, especially the posse at the end composed of only two people going after the bad guy, and whether or not someone could actually survive the freezing cold in his condition, but overall I enjoyed the film."" ]"
the-jungle-book-2016;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""First it was all the Princess movies.  Now Disney is cashing in by making live action films of all their old animated classics.  I enjoyed this remake, although I still think the original fully animated film has more charm.  This is a darker version, and in fact some of the sequences may be too much for young children.  The boy who plays the lead, Neel Sethi, does a fine job and does not overact like so many children his age tends to do.  The visuals are the true star of the picture.  Animation keeps getting more and more detailed as time goes on which can create controversy.  If it is too realistic looking, you don't even feel you're watching an animated film anymore.  The voice-over work is also fine across the board.  Overall a winner."" ]"

After discovering it is directed by Spielberg I decided to watch it.  Glad I did.  Loved the first half of the film.  The second half, which gets really silly, not as much.  As always, Spielberg gets a first class performance from a child actor (Ruby Barnhill) and a terrific performance from Mark Rylance as the giant.  If you have a great subwoofer and want to show it off, this is the film for you.  When the girl first meets the giant his footsteps and movements will make your entire house shake!  Overall I really enjoyed the film."" ]"
finding-dory;8;2;Bikerjames;"[ ""As sequels go, Finding Dory is an unqualified Pixar success.  Colorful, funny, and moving with outstanding animation and 3D, there are no boring moments.  It's a little more \""frantic\"" than the original Nemo, and since the storyline is similar some of the freshness of the original is gone.  In the original Nemo had to find a way out of one aquarium.  In this one, fish are constantly hopping from container to container to container even moving from building to building making the story seem less believable.  The rescue scene of the Van on the freeway is way over the top and felt like a Looney Tunes cartoon rather than Pixar.  The animated short \""Piper\"" they show at the beginning, however, is outstanding and probably my favorite short they have done so far.  Incredible animation, maybe the best I've ever seen."" ]"
deadpool;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""Deadpool is not your typical superhero movie.  More a comedy/parody, the one liners are fast and furious.  So many, in fact, that many lines went right over the heads of the entire audience.  Lines that were supposed to be funny sometimes weren't.  You would have to have a vast knowledge of pop culture to get all the jokes.  Still, many lines were funny.  The film has a justified \""R\"" rating, for both language and violence.  Ryan Reynolds was terrific in the film and was definitely the right actor for the job.  The action sequences, like so many today, are so overly edited that you can't always tell what is going on.  I liked the movie, I just didn't think it was quite funny enough to be a classic."" ]"
valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets;8;1;TheWaffle;"[ ""A great science fiction romp. The film speeds by so many interesting visuals and ideas pulling you into the next one before you've barely caught your breath. However, this is definitely not a film for everyone, it is outlandish and bizarre and will often contradict its own world's rules several times in the same scene. You should definitely go in with more of a Monty Python mentality and less of a Star Wars mentality. The only major issue I had was with a 30-minute plot cul de sac right in the middle of the film. Rihanna shows up for a goofy and awkward side story that should have been completely cut from the final film; it merely provides a long distraction from the main plot and adds nothing to the overarching story. I love that she's bringing people into the theaters for fun action sci-fi films like Battleship and Valerian, but they're clearly creating custom characters for her that just aren't very good. I loved everything before she shows up and after she leaves."" ]"

Listening to the critics you would be convinced that this movie is a train wreck, and that is far from the reality. All of the criticisms are accurate, but all of the issues raised are very minor next to all of the great aspects of the film. The editing is weak, the scenes don't always flow logically from one to another, and I could have used a couple extra scenes setting up Wonder Woman's history (we've all seen Batman's origin a dozen times by now), but the action, story, and acting more than make up for the procedural errors."" ]"
snowpiercer;10;3;TheWaffle;"[ ""Director Joon-ho Bong has taken an outlandish premise and crafted a film that is beautiful and unforgettable. The themes are very thinly veiled and it's not difficult to see the convenient lies that we will tell ourselves to justify the status quo. We just rarely see them so close at hand as we do in Snowpiercer. The privileged chosen by birth, convinced that they belong and that those born into crippling poverty belong in the slums. Snowpiercer is the story of society, including the inhuman suffering that society is often built upon."" ]"
robocop-2013;8;1;TheWaffle;"[ ""A great reimagining of the original classic. There are a few head-scratching departures from the original (particularly Murphy's \""death\"" scene and the decision to go for PG-13 rather than R) and far too little screen-time for Murphy's partner played by Michael \""Omar\"" Williams, but this is a great action flick in the vein of Dredd and The Raid. RoboCop is fast-paced without feeling rushed, and the cast is fantastic, especially Jackie Haley, Michael Keaton, and Gary Oldman. RoboCop himself isn't stellar but he gets the job done.

In a universe with skull-shaped space stations and a walking house plant, their schtick has consistently great timing. Dave Batista feels sort of like an after thought as Drax, but he gets plenty of his own gags as well. There are plenty of goofy comic-book universe moments, but none that are really out-of-place in the last decade's series of entries. I get the sense that there was plenty of fan-service, but that all went over my head."", """", ""The movie's only real weakness is Zoe Saldana as Gamora, whose lady-ninja love-interest typecast is rapidly getting stale. Whether in Drumline, Star Trek, Columbiana, or Avatar, she's the exact same character, and throughout Guardians she seems to be the only character not enjoying the adventure. And based on the few scenes where we see her opposite Karen Gillan (playing Nebula) it's hard not to wonder if they miscast the two of them since Gillan conveys much more anger and power while Saldana seems to be the pretty girl that barely hits someone and sends their stunt doubles flying across the room."" ]"
interstellar;8;1;TheWaffle;"[ ""A great movie. Novel premise, grand scope and scale, and it's believable. Interstellar is definitely worth watching. I have a few minor critiques, the film takes a while getting to the meat. I'd gladly trade a few minutes of farmville 2080 AD for a few more minutes of the grand adventure that fills the last 1.5 hours of the movie. A few things take getting used to, especially Cooper's robot companions who talk with no hint of a robotic voice and whose design and function looks a bit bizarre (they're like walking soda machines). On their voice, it's supposed to be a practical humanized crew-member but it's distracting for a few minutes. Our adventurers make a few absurd rookie astronaut/scientist mistakes, but that's to be expected to spice up and generate conflict in sci-fi. My primary complaint is in a few areas that are starting to become major problems in Nolan's story-telling, for instance his characters love to explain things at length, long after the audience has gotten on board with an idea. We saw a ton of this in Inception, where almost every shot in the final dream sequence was of someone explaining the rules of Nolan's universe. Interstellar has Dr. Brand explaining the multi-dimensional science of love for too long, Dr. Mann ruminating on the nature of humanity, and Cooper reviewing the rules of relativity over and over. Nolan needs to trim each of these sequences down to the bare information for the audience. And then there's...spoilers to follow..."", """", ""--- SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS ---"", """", ""Nolan needs to get off his sunny-happy ending kick. Memento, The Prestige, and Inception messed with you through either pitch-black endings or ambiguity. And then Dark Knight came along, and all the talk of sacrifice evaporates when we realize that Bruce Wayne is going to retire at age 40 to live in Italy with Anne Hathaway. Interstellar plays the same game, pouring sacrifice on top of sacrifice, and then it mostly disappears to make way for a squeaky clean ending. Interstellar's ending isn't as disappointing as Dark Knight Rises, but it teetered on that edge."" ]"

The film is full of social policy statements but it's harmless stuff, material you've seen and heard countless times before. It's just packaged in a slightly different way than the very similar Logan's Run.

dark-shadows;4;1;EludiumQ36;"[ ""\""Dark Shadows\"" is an oft-filmed tale of shunned-love accented by revenge.  This version is largely set in 1972 when director Tim Burton was a teen so the soundtrack is basically a best of 70s hits collection. All the principal actors get to dress up in period fashion with lots of flattering makeup and hairstyles which I think really thrills the actresses.

moonrise-kingdom;4;1;EludiumQ36;"[ ""This was an odd film across the board mainly due to the visuals, the actors, and their acting. First, the story is just a run-of-the-mill coming of age story centered on some 11 year olds. It's the type of story you've seen a dozen times before on Lifetime, A&E, CW, etc. But this particular film stands apart from them because of the elements I noted above, but doesn't apart in a good way. The film is set in 1965 and the film is quality is intentionally set to be grainy with yellow tinting, so my Blu-ray experience was obviously dampened. Then the actors - the principal stars (two kids) are unknowns but the supporting adult cast are all-stars. You'd think that would be great, but not so much. In fact, none do any better than unknowns could've but then this would've been an art-house flick instead of mainstream. Finally, I have to agree with \""dafuq\"" below who notes that there's no emotion or passion in any of the performances. Much of the dialogue is done in emotionless monotones and it's just a horrible shame. Obviously director Wes Anderson did this intentionally but why ?? It's not a fully wasted effort but it could've been so much better."" ]"

looper;5;2;EludiumQ36;"[ ""I reviewed this 4 yrs ago and that's what follows this updated one from Oct 2017. Basing a movie on time travel is fraught with peril. The main problem is plausibility and that's very tough with time travel since it's so easy to fall into the paradox trap, and \""Looper\"" is no different. Time travel also has to carefully address who's affected by it and whether your characters are in an alternate timeline or not. It gets complex and that's why it shouldn't be done unless it's prepared to put forth a really good effort and \""Looper\"" doesn't. The film is pretty interesting and entertaining but that's not saying much. It's like saying a horror film with ghosts that can talk, that are dressed with nice hairstyles, etc is good when clearly that's all Hollywood fantasy. I just wish someone here in the 21st century could put together a well thought out time travel scenario without tripping on a paradox in the first 15-minutes. I'd do it myself but Hollywood wouldn't pick it up. I'd have to produce and distribute myself and that's way too expensive. But maybe Amzn, Hulu, ... (Prior review from 2013 --> Decent enough story but this still doesn't make time travel believable, not sure that can ever be done  the plausibility of it, that is. But I'm pretty sure people just appearing and disappearing isn't how it'll look. Same kind of thing with telekinesis, let alone being exhibited by a 10 yo kid.

Then there's the very final scene where he joins the Daily Planet which makes absolutely no sense in the context of this re-telling, I mean, the dude just saved the entire planet from some very bad characters so now he takes a menial job at a newspaper.

That would've made for a good edit since this film is a long-ish 2hrs. And I can't help but think that at the end of the race, if this was filmed in the 70s, the cop would've walked up to Tobey to arrest him with some amount of admiration, but these days you get the militarized, hyper-response with all guns drawn on a skinny, exhausted racer - pitiful, good film otherwise."" ]"
her;7;4;EludiumQ36;"[ ""This is a confounding film to rate but I'm rating on the positive side for the overall feeling I have through it and its end. My biggest problem is with its technical plausibility. Theodore acquires a retail version of newly introduced (meaning v1.0) OS1, an artificially intelligent computer operating system. Fine so far. However, the film's depiction of OS1 is super-hyper-idealized, it's flawless, something that shouldn't be attainable until like version 50 and then only after dozens of premium add-ons and upgrades. But if the director wants to go this way then that's his prerogative, but plausibility is important and can't be magically waved off. As Theodore's relationship with \""Samantha\"" evolves you can see scene by scene that they touch upon the highs and lows of normal, human relationships. It has an episodic series feel to it, like a short-run tv show that Netflix or Hulu would do. If you \""get into\"" the movie then you may need tissues at the end, but again you have to shut off the \""what the @#$?\"" side of your brain because how can a retail version of an operating system evolve to do what Samantha does at the end?! There's all manner of warranty and lawsuit claims that come from that. Again, setting all that aside, it was interesting and touching, not a waste of time, but I'd like to see a story with a more realistic, flawed AI operating system."" ]"

And of course it follows that Rey is \""a new hope\"", and dollars-to-donuts, with the Rebels', er Resistance's win, Episode VIII will parallel \""The Empire Strikes Back\"" with the First Order recovering and having another go at the Resistance.

This particular installment was the most CG action porn I've seen in quite some time. It was just so obvious that so much of this was done at green-screen, I'm not really sure the stars earned their pay! Seriously, I think all they had to do was run, jump, and roll a few times while the CG artists created all the mayhem around them. They're the ones that should be walking away with millions. My other complaint is just with the DNA of the franchise itself, all the snarky remarks from Stark, and the little bits and quips from the others just cheapens the gravity of the situation. Similarly, with the need to save/evacuate that whole city. Is there something in the comic book domain that says the Innocent Public must be preserved at all costs?! This may have been laudable in the '40s/'50s but in this Age of Terrorism we KNOW this to be different and it just wreaks of quaint naivety which again cheapens the overall experience.

When leads Owen and Claire go all \""Romancing the Stone\"" on us running through the jungle with no training and in street clothes, and when all the flying dinos get loose in the park mall, everyone's just running around in the open getting picked off one by one like Hitchcock's \""The Birds\"" on steroids.  Then the final dino fight scene could've been superiorly epic but the director had to keep weaving the leads in which just added more and more stupid.

These can never be outstanding/classic films because of that - there's no element of genuine surprise. Star Trek follows the same plot formula every single time, the only thing that changes is the superficial layers of plot and nods to all facets of diversity. This type of entertainment can only appeal to the pre-teen/teen brain that hasn't developed sufficient capacity to critique. It's a shameless yet surefire money grab for that demographic's money - it never fails, but it never advances the art either. Yet, the writers ultimately know this.

The special effects are impressive as is the acting of Ms. Gadot but that, unfortunately, is where the accolades end. The film is about 2 and ½ hours in running time (at least one hour longer than it should have been) which caused me to fall asleep at least once during its exhibition. To make matters worse, the plot is complicated, concocted and confusing, three “c’s which aren’t good for any film to have in its description.

Nicely directed by Lone Scherfig (“An Education”, “Italian for Beginners”),  the production values in the film are modest to say the least but nevertheless portray the efforts of the filmmakers within the film to achieve their propaganda goal and in the course of it, bring humor and sadness in unique combination as the umbrella of the blitz looms over every scene and occurrence. This is not a great film by any means but it does communicate the British grit as Londoners seek to persevere and survive a difficult time in the mid 1940’s and beyond. I give the film an 8 with special recognition to Ms. Arterton and Mr Nighy who, each in his and her own way, gave it “their finest”."" ]"

The “spoiler” title tells a lot of what this movie is about but it is indeed much more. Reaching beyond his traditional roles, Mr. Gere, in exemplary fashion, portrays the part of Norman Oppenheimer, a self-styled consultant/businessman who knows someone who knows someone else who knows another who can get you the contacts or deals you are seeking. The film takes us into the inner workings of smart east coast investors to the chambers and offices of the Israeli Knesset, its cabinet and its Prime Minister, and how Norman, by conniving and sheer “chutzpah”, interacts with them all. For those familiar with Yiddish parlance, he would be commonly referred to as a “macher”, or in English, an influential guy with great connections. The interesting point in the casting is that the actors portraying the Israeli members of the cast are, in fact, Israeli, but the other Jewish roles, including Norman, are played by non-Jewish performers such as Michael Sheen, as Norman’s nephew, and Steve Buscemi, as Norman’s rabbi. Make no mistake, this film is more universal in its appeal than the semitic nature of its script would imply for it deals with drama, political intrigue, thrills and a story that will keep the viewer interested, on edge and appreciative of a well performed and well written motion picture. I give the film a 9 snd, as Norman himself might say, “try it, you’ll like it”"" ]"

More to the point, it tells the story of a down on his luck salesman named Ray Kroc who by chance comes upon the hamburger and shakes stand owned and operated by the McDonald brothers (the real founders) and how he ultimately took their small enterprise and made it into one of the most well known and successful international food serving entities in history (and which, by estimate, is now serving approximately 1% of the world’s population). Alas for poor Mr Keaton who always seems to be so much better than the movies in which he appears. This film falls into that category except for the fact that this is, after all,  the story of McDonalds and how one man was able to create this huge enterprise and make it the most powerful force in the franchise food industry. Add to that the always dependable quality performance of Mr. Keaton and the film’s historical significance and it becomes a vehicle well worth viewing.

Unfortunately, the star value and the once good idea behind the screenplay fail to save this film from being slow and discombobulated as it strives to reach its unattainable goal. This, once again, is the classic case of the writer and director being one in the same  person with no 3rd party filter to help cut, edit and alter the film into something cohesive and easy to watch. Mr. Mills, like most who assume these dual roles, becomes married to his own material, is afraid to alter it and never really allows the audience  to properly see, forgive the pun, the “big picture”.  I give the film a 6.0 because yawning 3 times during the film and checking my watch 4 is testament enough to why it deserves such a low rating."" ]"

Simmons, the film tells in detail the efforts of law enforcement to track down and ultimately either capture or kill the two terrorist brothers responsible for the attack. One might wonder how a film can engender suspense and interest when its outcome is already known to most if not all of its viewers.  “Sully” is a perfect example that such a feat can be accomplshed when there is enough material and good writing to make it happen. Also, like “Sully” the coda at the end of the film introduces us to the real life people who were portrayed in the film which gives glaring reality to the events depicted in it.  I truly enjoyed the film, not only for the good writing and acting , but for the information imparted to the audience as law enforcement worked tirelessy and with speed to end the nightmare that befell the City of Boston.

The rape scenes are brutal in their violence and makes the viewing of the film an uneasy experience. What is more uneasy is the mind of the viewer as he or she recalls and tries to understand the theatrical presentation they have just seen for the story is complicated and made even more so by the subtitles. I am sure a French viewer would find the film easier to understand than his or her English-speaking counterpart. All that being said, this film is filled with suspense and mystery and, more than anything else, is a tribute and testament to the talents of Ms. Huppert.

I might also mention that one of the producers of the film, Julie Ansell, is the daughter of one of our readers,  Although Ms. Steinfeld’s performance, as with the other actors, is genuine and quite skilled, the film itself is more like a television movie than a full length theatrical motion picture, certainly as to the depth of the writing and the production values it seeks to achieve.

Virginia (which declared that marriage among any couple, regardless of race, was a right that the states could not deny). This decision laid the groundwork for the ultimate ruling by the high court acknowledging the rights of person of the same sex to also have the right to marry and so the film, and the story, goes far beyond 1967 to our present day human rights victories.  Defying the old adage that a writer/director cannot do both as effectively as if there were 2 separate individuals In those roles, Jeff Nichols does a noteworthy job in both capacities and brings forth from the actors subtle, low key performances that capture the strength and humility that are typical of so many of history’s unsung heroes.

I found that the film was too long and draggy and the scenes and chapters did not flow or segue from one to the other in an easy manner. Casting also became an issue but one would have to actually see the film to understand this comment.  Make no mistake, this is a powerful and important film showing the plight that so many lower class youths experience and how their intra-cultural encounters so often shape their low expectancy lives. Mr. Jenkins, as writer and director, has I fear bitten off a bit more than he can chew. However, with all that being said, he has given us an interesting and thought provoking product.

The film is based on the life of the real Florence Foster Jenkins.  Hugh Grant, as her dedicated and loyal husband joins. Ms. Streep in receiving accolades for his sensitive portrayal as her enabling spouse and companion. Unfortunately, as with most films based on real events, the writer and director are tied to the facts, whether they be interesting or not.

The film stars Tom Hanks, Laura Linney and Aaron Eckhart and was directed by Clint Eastwood who, like rare wine, seems to get better with each passing year. Told via flashbacks and background events, the audience is made an integral part of the fateful events that the passengers on the New York to Charleston flight experienced that cold winter morning as their plane departed from Laguardia Airport and ended up in the icy waters of the Hudson. The film is indeed a testament to the expertise of the pilot whose split second performance is later evaluated and scrutinized by the investigating agencies using the benefit of hindsight with their self-serving 20/20 vision. It’s always impressive to see a film where everyone knows the outcome yet a feeling of tension and anxiety can be so effectively created in spite of that. Kudos to Mr. Eastwood whose directorial skills show themselves in each frame and scene and make this a truly positive movie to see. A Washington Post article jokingly said that one should never travel with Mr. Hanks for as \""Captain Phillips\"", the Federal Express employee in \""Cast Away\"" and the commander of \""Apollo 13\"", his trips almost always seem to encounter problems. That being said, I urge all to travel this time with Mr. Hanks as Captain Sullenberger on his 280 second flight from land to water, It is a quality venture that the movie traveler most certainly will enjoy.

The director and cinema photographer more than adequately capture and depict the mood and lifestyle of Western Texas and of those who reside there. The film does, however, raise serious questions as to the morality of the times and how far a person or group, believing he or they have been wronged,  can or should go in order to seek his or their perception of  “justice”.

Walking a thin line between a pathetic pursuer and a mild mannered Fatal Attraction type, the movie, for me at least, was uncomfortable  to watch especially when viewing the unrewarded efforts of this spinster trying to go where few real life and especially movie heroines dare to tread.. More comedic scenes and less sad and serious ones might have made the film easier to watch and maybe even enjoy but, for me, the only saving grace in the film is the tremendous effort Ms. Field exerts in trying to make this film better than it is.

Spanning a period of less than a week in their lives, this is the story of a long lost romance Geoff had well before he ever met Kate and how this 50 year old experience suddenly impacts on their present lives and, more significantly, Kate’s reaction and response to what she now learns about it. Mr. Courtenay plays a subdued and stoic role as he attempts to move on from the past while Ms. Rampling’s character becomes more absorbed with the historic details as if this now deceased part of her husband’s life is still alive and in competition with her.

Although the film is long and at times somewhat tedious, it is in effect mirroring the relationship of the couple on the screen as they, in their typical British civility, struggle through the emotional obstacles that confront them.

With so much material available, the Coens missed almost every opportunity to make the film work and could have elicited genuine laughter instead of only a slight smile or grin from an audience anxiously wanting and hoping for more. It should also be noted that Mr. Clooney and Ms. Johansson, two charismatic and generally enjoyable actors to watch, should not attempt slapstick comedy for the result is more tragic than humorous. Also, the film with many subplots never properly allows any of them to develop and what could have been a clever spoof of making films in the mid 20th Century becomes a poor but unsuccessful  attempt to be funny.  Knowing what could have been achieved but wasn’t is even more frustrating.

The film attempts to capture the conflicts and problems arising out of a relationship totally out of sync with the morals and values of the time in which it took place and although Ms. Blanchett's and Ms. Mara's acting deserve special recognition, for this viewer, at least, sitting through the film was a slow and tedious experience..

Although the movie takes no definitive position as to the veracity of the charges made in the infamous episode, it obviously gives a kind nod to those who produced the segment, especially since the screenplay relies for the most part on the memoirs of Ms. Mapes and her book. Regardless of the substance of the allegations, the airing of the episode led to the termination of Mr. Rather as CBS News  Anchor (after 24 years in that role), the firing of his producer, Ms. Mapes, and the forced resignations of her staff. The quest for determining the authenticity of the sources and documents relied on by Ms. Mapes and her staff give us not only an insight into the inner workings of the newsroom but, more than that, an intereesting detective mystery with many unanswered questions.

Intermixed with cartoon characters and running commentary from the brother. as his sister ardently films the family’s interactions, this is, on the surface, a film about Indian parents seeking to preserve their cultural line and identity.

Champa, the mother, could be the Italian or Jewish mother and Vasant, the father, could be any concerned father wanting his children to stay in their ethnic arena. In its own amateurish way, the film holds the viewer’s interest and  gives us a \""fly on the wall \"" feeling as we watch caring parents and children respect each other while not necessarily accepting their generational differences.

Please note my disclaimer since I am no fan of Mr. Kingsley who generally tries to portray characters inconsistent with his film image (e.g. \""Sexy Beast\""). Here, however, playing the part of a Sikh cab driver/driving instructor, Mr. Kingsley resorts back to his Ghandi style mode and, although suitable to what he does best, his character pontificates and remains so aloof that, as a result, it robs the film of the warmth and depth it so vitally needs. This is a film that can best be described as …\""A woman gets divorced and takes driving lessons:\"" Anything beyond  that is icing and fluff on a cake that itself isn’t that palatable.

With all due respect to the performances of Messrs. Keaton and Ruffalo and Ms. McAdams,, the film takes too long to tell its story and is definitely a \""look at my watch\"" experience. Nevertheless, the importance of the subject matter and the tenacity of those investigating and ultimately writing the story that won their paper a Pulitzer Prize makes it a film worth seeing.

Mr. Clark is  ably abetted by Keira Knightley, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robin Wright, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson. Written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, the movie was directed by Icelandic director Baltesar  Kormakur whose deft hand and skill help make this 121 minute film move at a very comfortable pace. Of course the real star of the film is Mt. Everest itself for it is the dominance of this natural edifice that controls and ultimately destroys so many who have challenged it.

This is an important event in the history and struggle for equality and justice for all citizens, and especially the Black minority. Unfortunately, it deserved a better vehicle to display it. Superbly acted by David Oyelowe (as Dr. King) the film was directed by Ava Dwerney who co-wrote the film with Paul Webb. The film, although only 2 hours in length, feels more like 3, for it is burdened with long speeches where normally everyday dialogue would have been the case.  Actors don’t speak, they pontificate, and scenes that should be shorter are too long. Poor writing, editing and directing appear to be the culprit causing this film with such a worthy purpose and lofty goal to be less effectual in its execution. Also, what would otherwise have been a great history lesson, especially for those too young at the time to realize the importance of the civil rights struggle in the mid-60’s, is the less than accurate portrayal of key characters, notably President Lyndon. Johnson, whose major claim to fame was his ability to put through the Voting Rights Bill (an effort, history shows, was started weeks before the Selma march). True, sometimes poetic license adds drama to a film but a 180 degree turn from the facts can destroy a venture’s credibility. I give the film an 8 rating because of its important role and significance in portraying a most difficult time in our nation’s history and in showing the courage and tenacity of a great leader who brought about much needed change.

No matter how much you want to lose yourself into the film and the character Mr. Carell attempts to portray, you (or I at least) are constantly reminded that it is Mr. Carell wearing lots of makeup.

As far as the film is concerned, and as clever and witty as the lyrics are, the numbers are too long and, as a result, create a movie experience that causes the viewer to wish it would end at least 30 or 40 minutes before it actually does. One must also recognize the obvious intention of the producers to \""get their money's worth\"" from Ms. Streep who is over utilized and, as in her role in Mamma Mia, is at her best in a non-musical setting.

It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to \""bring out the best\"" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it’s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art. The caveat here, though, is that if intense musicology, training and signficant jazz performances are not the viewer’s \""thing\"", then this film will not be appreciated by him or her to the same extent as it was by me."" ]"

The film was directed by James Marsh and stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. One must approach this film as both a factual summary of the trials and efforts of a genius confined to the prison of his voiceless and motionless body and, also, as an entertainment vehicle.

Directed by Michael Winterbottom, Coogan and Brydon drive their way in their Mini-Cooper convertible along the Italian coast sampling persons and cuisine of the most delightful nature. Intermixes with the tour they are taking are references to the two tourists’ personal life and the not so fictional versions of them. Coogan and Brydon are wonderful as they banter, ad-lib and joke with each other about their respective traits and personalities but, through it all, a caring and bonding that is rarely found in two friends without any negative agenda. You watch the film liking its heroes and wishing you could be the third member of their group. Unorthodox and unlike most films the viewer will see, I give the movie an 8 for, above all, it is fun to watch, extremely entertaining and allows the audience to experience, not only the charm of really funny men but, in addition, the breathtaking beauty of the landscape that is Italy."" ]"

This is Mr. Miyazaki’s last animated film and, indeed, the filmgoing community is the lesser for it. The graphics contained in this film are breathtaking and as beautiful to view as one can imagine. The film tells the life story of one of the world’s greatest aircraft engineers, Jiro Hurikushi, as it follows his career as a near sighted boy who dreams of flying but, because of his poor eyesight, is forced to vicariously enjoy his passion by designing airplanes instead, The film chronicles Mr. Hurikushi’s life through Japan’s great earthquake in the early 20th Century, the massive tuberculosis epidemic and its great depression and is as enlightening as it is entertaining. The film is offered on two different screens, one with the original dialogue (with English subtitles) and the other with the English dubbed in. See the technically perfect dubbed in version with actor Joseph Gordon-Lewitt as Jiro and Emily Blunt as Naoko, the love of his life. The movie comes as near to perfect as possible but for one problem. It is too long and looking at my watch during the approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes was a distraction. As has so often been said, when the writer also assumes the role of director, it is like a parent trying to edit out the performances of his children….a difficult task that requires more objectivity than dedication and proves that too much of a good thing necessarily isn’t.  With all of that being said, the film is nevertheless a lovely theatrical viewing experience and one that will be as enjoyable for its adult audience to see as it will be for the children who accompany them. I give the film a rating of 9 as  this cinematic endeavor, like the wind in the title, will take the viewer to new and exciting heights. It is also a fitting farewell to Mr. Miyazaki and his own career as one of the world’s greatest animators."" ]"

Alas, that’s where the accolades for the film end for the performances of Mark Ruffalo (who always seems to play the same part) and the other performers are hampered by an average script and music that two generations after mine probably love but this writer could do without.

Having seen the play on Broadway I can attest to the fact that the 3 hour play with 2 intermissions was so well acted and directed that it seemed to be only 2 hours in length. Conversely, the movie is only 2 hours in length but seems like it extends beyond 3. No one can quarrel with the words of the author and the tremendous talent on the screen but it just doesn’t capture the intensity and tightness of the stage rendition. One can argue that Ms. Streep’s character was too dramatic and “over the top” but the role played both by Ms. Streep in the film and by Estelle Parsons on the stage required that kind of “overacting”. The character they portray is basically a drama queen and both actresses captured her essence perfectly. A great ensemble cast  that could have benefitted more by better editing, I give the film an 8. Remember, the essence of any performance, be it on stage or in a movie house, is  good writing. For that reason alone, the film is worth listening to and watching."" ]"

Mr. Hanks, it goes without saying, does a wonderful job portraying the late Walt Disney who strived to make this charming book into a film.. Fast becoming the Male Meryl Streep, it seems that Mr. Hanks can play any role and play it well.

I’m no fan of Mr. DiCaprio who, no matter what adult role he plays, always reminds me of a little boy wearing his father’s felt hat. However, in this film, Mr. DiCaprio overcomes my previewing prejudices and is quite believable in his role as Mr. Belfort but, unfortunately, that’s where the kudos end. The film is 3 hours long but seems more like 6. Thelma Schoonmaker is being touted by the producers for “Best Film Editing” but her work product, at least to this viewer, is virtually unnoticed. The film is filled with gratuitous sex scenes that are more crude than craft and actually get in the way of the story and plot. Orgies may have their place in depicting a scene in a Roman harem but they simply detract from the film and like most of the unneeded scenes, add to the uncomfortable length of the picture.

Television stars who transition to the big screen typically have difficulty shedding the image their small screen roles have imposed upon them and the longer the series runs, the more of a problem it becomes. Jason Alexander will always be “George” in spite of his many efforts to leave that image behind. So, it is an awesome experience to watch Mr..Gandolfini, and Ms. Louis-Dreyfus successfully depart from their “Tony Soprano” and “Elaine” personas and portray totally different characters. Much of this success belongs to Ms. Nicole Hofofcener who wrote and directed this delightful film. There is the expected humor but, more than that, the film delves deeply into the mid-life crises each of the characters faces and the sensitivity of the writing is equal to the humor it evokes; a delicate balance indeed. The viewing experience is, of course, bitter sweet as one remembers the sad fact that Mr. Gandolfini is no longer with us and that this versatile and gifted actor left us much too soon with a body of work yet to be completed.

One of the more positive things about this film is that, although the plot is complicated and extremely involved, excellent writing and editing help make the most difficult of legal concepts and problems easy to understand and follow. This is no small task to accomplish given the intricacies and rules of law being applied.

Objectivity usually is replaced by sentiment and loyalty to the original product, regardless of its effect on the audience. Mr. Cretton proved that the opposite can be true for this film is wonderfully edited and plays out smooth as silk as it tells the tale of staffers in a foster care facility and the problems they experience with their teen age wards. It should be noted that Mr. Cretton worked in such a facility so there is legitimacy and honesty in his writing about it. There are subplots and small divergences which make for an interesting cinema experience. Ms. Larson is a talented actress with natural beauty and ability and the script affords her the opportunity to utilize her thespian skills so that you are ab;e tp identify with her and the difficulties in her life.

Sometimes, though, in an attempt to do the subject justice, the length of the film becomes a problem. Many scenes are drawn out and beg for better editing.. Mr. Whitaker plays the role with finesse and skill and he is totally believable (Academy take note) and others with whom he works do proper portrayals as well. The problem with the film is that, in many instances,  there really is no proper seque from one “chapter” or administraton to the next. Titles are used to tell us what era we are in because the script fails to do adequately.    Nevertheless, the film  attempts to depict life as a black person living (and dying) in the major portion of the 20th Century and, to that end, it succeeds admirably. The indignities and abuses hurled upon our fellow countrymen because of their color is shameful and hits home as the butler works by day in a white White House and goes home at night to his black environment and black reality.. The movie, for these reasons, digs deep and is worthy of our viewing time. I give the film an 8 because few films I have seen have left me with such a feeling of understanding and compassion for a race of people that deserved so much more and have, unfortunately, received so much less.

Palestinian actor Ali Suliman plays the doctor and Israeli actress Reymond Amsalem  his wife in this sometimes slow but nevertheless steady and interesting drama as our lead character seeks to find out why and how this crime was planned and performed. Directed by Ziad Doueiri who co-wrote the screenplay with Jollie Touma and Yasmina Khadia, these Arab creators attempt to examine and explain both sides of  those engaged in this almost never ending conflict. Their efforts are indeed frustrated since the Arab reaction to the film is that it is not harsh enough towards the Israelis and the Israeli response is that it goes too far in seeing to humanize the plight of the Palestinians. Indeed, the Arab backers of the film withdrew their names in protest and regretted their not having read the script first. As a result the film has been boycotted by most Arab nations and criticized by many Israelis. They say a fair settlement of a dispute is when each side leaves the table unhappy. Here, too, the problems facing the respective factions are complex and so, with no easy way to paint an objective picture of the participants and their respective causes, neither one is satisfied at the result.

As good as Mr. Brosnan is in the film, and he is, none of the players can meet or even come near the superb acting talents of Ms. Dyrholm who captures and dominates each scene she is in. The best that can be said of any quality foreign film is that, in recalling it, the viewer forgets that there were subtitles and that a different language was spoken.

First, a disclaimer. I am no fan of either Tobey maguire or of Mr. DiCaprio and with these precommitted feelings, it’s difficult to enjoy any vehicle either of them are in, let alone both. Mr. maguire whines his way through this overdone narrative and Mr. DiCaprio continues to look like a teenager trying to play an adult. If he uttered the phrase “old spoaht” one more time in the film, I would’ve thrown my 3D glasses at the screen. Speaking of that, this film has no dimension so the need to try to see it in 3D is useless. I at one point took off the glasses and could not honestly tell the difference. So visually and substantively, the film lacks so much except one thing…..time. This lifeless seemingly never ending film lasts for 2 and  hours and screams for an editor’s splicing machine. The special effects and scenery, as costly as they may have been, seems to be the impetus for the movie’s length since it’s hard to put so much set money on the floor of the editing room. The old “how many times did I look at my watch” test proved accurate for I recall no less than 6. This Gatsy is neither ‘great’ nor ‘good’ and, at best, is mediocre.  As bad as the 1974 version of the film with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow was, this is probably worse. I give the film a rating of 3.The viewers, F.

For this writer the film was especially meaningful for I lived in the Borough during the time  in which this all took place and, as a young boy, I watched from the Ebbett’s Field bleachers the players on the field as they interacted with this new entry into the ballgame. Jackie Robinson, a four star athlete from UCLA and a commissioned Army officer (court martialed for refusing to move to the back of a bus) was the perfect man to, at 26, enter upon the road to ending the bigotry that was, after all, so much a part of America’s favorite sport at the time. Just as we today cannot imagine women not being able to vote 100 years ago, so difficult is it for us to understand what racism was in the 50’s and how shameful a legacy it left. If there is any difficulty with the film, it is trying to depict its hero.as recognizable but without it being a trite impersonation. Mr. Boseman is not a Robinson look alike yet there are certain times, stances and camera shots that make his portrayal quite believable. Harrison Ford, as Branch Rickey, the managing partner of the group that owned the Dodgers, is a fine addition to the film. Never too overly sentimental, the film does have its “Hollywood moments” but they are few and far between. Suffice it to say that the women and non-baseball fans in the audience seemed to enjoy the film as  much or more than the rest of us. I give this film an 8 and recommend that it be seen by all who have a taste for history and/or a strong liking for baseball. More than anything else it is the story of adversity and how it was met head on by a strong willed and extraordinarily self-controlled individual. The story of this man and who he was can best be summarized by quoting the writer Bob Considine when he wrote “Jackie Robinson was a credit to his race….the human race.”"" ]"

Although interesting from the point of view of the history of the nation's most famous crime fighting organization, I'm sorry to say that the film was much too long. Instead of shortening Hoover's name in the title of the film, the editors should have deleted a lot of unnecessary footage as the movie struggles to find itself and its proper pace.  In this case FBI could stand \""For Boring Individuals\"". Even good things should end in a timely manner. This is not the Clint Eastwood we came to know in \""The Unforgiven\"" or his other great films.

Ms. Williams becomes Ms. Monroe and gives the performance of her career as she captures her character's nuances and likenesses to such an extent that even Meryl Streep would be forced to sit up and give a nod of approval.

After all, the film experience should be pleasurable and something to enjoy. Nevertheless, I took the opportunity to view the film on a DVD a friend generously loaned to us. As I watched the film my concerns were indeed realized for some of the scenes were certainly uncomfortable to watch. However It was worth the 10 or 15 total minutes of discomfort to be able to be artistically exhilarated as we saw inhumanity and dignity oppose each other in what was the then mentality and norm of the slave genre and the society that embraced it. The acting of Chiwitel Ejifor, the writing of John Ridley and the direction of Steve McQueen make this a rewarding theatrical experience which the viewer will find difficult to forget or even equal. The film tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a cultured and well respected African American northerner, who is kidnapped and then sold into slavery by his abductors and ends up spending 12 years on one or more southern plantations. It’s easy for an audience member, black or white, to identify with the lead character and that is what makes the film work so well.  Massive suffering among thousands is a broad and almost meaningless phrase when compared to describing the plight of one individual.

Having been born near and totally familiar with the area where the story takes place, I can attest to how well the film captures the mood and feel of the Metropolis  and the life New Yorkers experienced at that time. It is always exciting to view a film where the writer/director, although one and the same, is able to succeed so well in both capacities. I give the film a 9 rating with special kudos to Mr. Isaac who, reminding the viewer of a younger Al Pacino, gives a most effective performance in this most enjoyable film."" ]"
wild-tales;10;9;BHBarry;"[ ""\""Wild Tales\"" is a multi-storied vehicle written and directed by Damian Szifron. One of the nominees for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so, the film consists of 6 independent stories threaded together by the theme of revenge and retribution. From the tale of an angry lover whose mate has been unfaithful to the story of  a citizen frustrated by government corruption and  four other stories in between, these are tales woven together by a masterful story teller in the person of Senor Szifron. Superbly acted, photographed, written and directed, this film stands out as one of the most enjoyable theatrical experiences this viewer has had the pleasure of being part of in a long long time. It is no easy feat to be able to tie so many individual tales in such a way that the viewer never feels he or she is watching separate films but, instead, one large overview of the human condition and how we each cope with the circumstances that befall us. I give the film a 10 4 s and urge all who can to make it a must-see on their movie list.."" ]"

The movie stars Blythe Danner in her role as a widow in her 70’s facing life with her similarly situated friends and additional and varied male encounters. Ably supported by Rhea Perlman, May Kay Place and Sam Elliott, this is a charming film played beautifully by Ms. Danner who, at 72, portrays the widow with the sensitivity and intensity that only someone who has experienced in her real life that which  the script has dictated for her. The widow of the late Bruce Paltrow and the mother of Gwyneth, Ms. Danner evokes in the viewer the honesty of her character so that the audience is seeing more than an actress simply performing a role. Ms. Danner has lived the reality of the film character in her personal life and one cannot feel that she is bringing much of that to the screen. This is a film worth seeing if, for no other reason, the fine performance of this wonderful actress who dominates every scene she is in and keeps the audience in the palm of her hand. I give the film an 8.0 rating and urge that it be seen by young and old alike for its message is universal and true."" ]"
american-sniper;8;7;BHBarry;"[ ""\""American Sniper\"" is, as most people know, the story of Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL whose feats in his four Tours of Duty served as the basis for his book and upon which the movie is based. Directed by Clint Eastwood with a screenplay by Jason Hall, the film stars Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. This is the story of a true patriot whose love of country knows no bounds and is inspiring to the most callous of disbelievers. Much like the movie \""Selma\"", the subject of the film is greater than the film itself. This is an action packed war picture with lots of action and, true to Mr. Eastwood’s love of the military and the battles they face, shows us the true nature of the conflict and trials and tribulations of the brave men who fight in them and the mental and physical healing that is so critical to their survival. I viewed the film under the best of circumstances in an IMAX theater and still came away feeling that I had seen \""another war film\"" rather than the great piece of film making that is receiving so much revenue, drawing so many crowds and receiving so many craft nominations. The film is much too long and at times the audience feels it is taking these extra tours of duty along with the"", ""characters in the film.

Written by Ms. Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, this film amply displays the acting talents of Ms Schumer as well as her extraordinary writing talents. Deeply moving in the relations Ms. Schumer’s character has with her sister and divorced father, the film is able to generate great pathos and sentiment while at the same time causing us to laugh and appreciate each moment. LeBron James, playing himself, has a significant role in the move and together with other notable NBA figures, gives a degree of authenticity and honesty to the story. Most of all it is Ms. Shcumer’s film for she proves once again that the transition from comedy to drama is easier to achieve for a comic than it is for a dramatic star to do comedy.. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch and to experience great writing as well. I give the film 3 and ½ stars and recommend it to audiences and viewers of all ages."" ]"

Based on the book by Bruce Cook with a screenplay written by John McNamara, the film was directed by Jay Roach. Bryan Cranston plays the title role and Diane Lane, his wife, Cleo, with Michael Stuhlberg portraying noted actor, Edward G. Robinson. Helen Mirren is a convincing Hedda Hopper and Louis C.K ably assists in the film thus proving once again that a good comedy actor can play any serious role (although the converse is not always true). Mr. Trumbo’s story, a successful writer who, because of the blacklist, was forced to write using \""fronts\"" (i.e. fictitious names instead of those of the real author). This is a film that teaches how to overcome obstacles and the economic and emotional stresses imposed upon those whose only crime it would appear was to attempt to preserve their respective rights of privacy and independence. Intermixed in the film are clips from newsreels and the hearings that took place at the time giving added credibility and  relevance to the events that I’m sure so many involved would like to forget Mr. Trumbo, noted for screenplays ranging from \""Kitty Foyle\"", \""Roman Holiday\"" and \""Spartacus\"" perhaps said s it best when he recalled this difficult era in a speech to the Writers Guild of America and noted that \""there were no heroes or villains in this troubling time, only victims\"". Although many of us lived through this era and time and can remember the incredulous abuses heaped upon artists, teachers and so many others, there are those of later generations who do not. It is for them as well as for us to be made aware and to be reminded of what took place.  I give the film an 8.0  and urge that it be seen by all who cherish freedom,  justice and the indomitable spirit to survive."" ]"

The dialogue and plot were witty and fast paced and the acting by Mr. Phoenix held up to the standards of the role.

The film is fast paced with breathtaking action scenes and a plot that keeps unraveling at the same speed as the action on the screen. Rumored to have performed many of the action scenes himself, Mr. Cruse is the definitive action hero. Although slightly over 2 hours in length, the viewer is never concerned about that because he or she is too busy following what is taking place on the screen. I give the film an 8.0 and trust that most who watch it will be as pleasantly surprised as I was to find that it is a mission possible for some sequels to be as good or better than the original.."" ]"
steve-jobs;8;7;BHBarry;"[ ""\""Steve Jobs\"" was directed by Danny Boyle (\""Slumdog Millionaire\"") and stars Michael Fassbender in the title role ably supported by Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels,, Kate Winslet, Michael Stuhlberg and Katherine Waterston. Written by Aaron Sorkin, the film attempts to tell the story of this genius at helping people communicate with each other through the digital age while himself never quite coming to grips with his own personal demons. The vehicle for the film is the backstage goings on for the 3 launches of Jobs’ products, i.e. the Mac, the NEXT and the iMac. The same drama that precedes the hour or half hour before each launch allows Mr. Sorkin to elicit dialogue from the same five  protagonists  as the audience tries to follow and understand the complexities and inconsistencies of this self acclaimed icon. Similar to last year’s film, \""Birdman\"" (though notably better), the viewer is brought backstage to the inner workings of the presentation process and, through it, the man himself. Based loosely on the Walter Isaacson biography, the film never quite captures the true essence of the man and unfortunately gives us a cleverly written but rather thin  two dimensional look at the lead character. We know as little or less about Mr. Jobs after the film as we did before except that he is or can be arrogrant and callous while himself searching for the humanity that seems to always elude him. Fleeting bits of dialogue thrown in by Mr. Sorkin are apparently intended to give us some insight into the Jobs’ psyche but, unfortunately, they fail to satisfy the viewer’s intellect and curiosity. Nevertheless, the film does give a behind the scenes glimpse at the PR involved in the launching of a new product and the kind of excitement it can generate. This, together with the superb acting by this terrific cast, allows me to give this film an 8.0  rating. It’s a good film but one that, mindful of the skills and reputation of the writer and director and the subject matter they had to work with, never reaches the potential I would have hoped for and expected."" ]"

The film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu  (\""Birdman\"") who, with Mark L. Smith,  co-wrote the screenplay based on the novel by Michael Punke. Although shot in Canada and Argentina, the film attempts to depict the challenges of a South Dakota winter n 1823. The word \""revenant\"" is derived from the French word \""revenir\"" (i.e. to return) and literally means the return of the spirit from the dead. This is the plight of Mr. DiCaprio’s character as he struggles across the barren icy wasteland for over 2 and ½ hours of viewing time. The audience also feels his pain and anguish since it too has to suffer through this ordeal as it is forced to endure a tedious and overlong excursion through the cold and unforgiving wilderness. The difference of course is that Mr. DiCaprio was paid for his suffering while the audience was not. Mr. DiCaprio’s character is enmeshed in a thin story line and basically has a non-verbal role as the script requires him to do a great amount of crawling and some groaning but, unfortunately, these do not necessarily rise to the level of great entertainment."", ""One must acknowledge the haunting and vitally important original musical score created by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto and the spectacular photography of Emmanuel Lubizki. That being said,  I found myself looking at my watch at least 3 times during the film in hopes that it was nearing its conclusion and wondering why I saw what the editor didn’t. I give the film a 6.0 rating for it proves once again that advertising and hype will not always make a film great but a quality screenplay and strong acting performances will.

Enhanced by the beautiful scenery of the bush country and the tremendous acting of both young master Dennison and Mr. Neill, the film is an adventure, a comedy and a drama perhaps better suited for a movie of the week on television.

This is a simple film filled with simple characters who in some way or another bring hope and joy to their otherwise bland existences. What makes the film work is that it is effortless viewing as the audience, via flashback, witnesses the youth and adulthood of Mr. Ove and how, in each instance, he plays the hands life has dealt him. I give the film an 8.0 with a note to anyone wishing to see it that it will no longer be distributed and available for viewing after October 13, an indeed unlucky number for anyone who misses it."" ]"
denial;8;7;BHBarry;"[ ""“Denial” is the true story of an American Holocaust scholar, Deborah E. Lipstadt, who was sued for libel by a Holocust denier as recounted in her book entitled “Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier”. The screenplay for the film was written by David Hare based on Ms. Lipstadt’s book. Mick Jackson directed the film which stars Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spatt. This is basically a courtroom drama played out in the London courts and gives the audience a clear understanding of the fundamentals of the British legal system and the roles the solicitor and barrister play. Yet this is not just another Holocaust story but a rather sensitive and personal insight into those who teach about this unfortunate event in world history as well as those who lived to tell about it. Ms. Weisz’ performance is extraordinary and she communicates her dedication to the role certainly in some part because of her own personal background and experience. As a lawyer I can recite a number of improbabilities and inaccuracies that take place in the courtroom scenes but one must remember that the screenplay is based on the perceptions of Ms. Lipstadt and I believe that, had there been more input from a barrister or solicitor in the making of the film, the noted inaccuracies would not have appeared. That being said, and seeing the film as a layman seeking a good entertainment experience, this film adequately attains that goal.

Written by Art Linson (with help from stand up comics Jeff Ross, Richard LaGravenes and Lewis Friedman) the film was directed by Taylor Hackford (‘The Devil’s Advocate”, “Ray”, “An Officer and a Gentlemen’). Unfortunately, with all of these fine participants, the film is a disappointment and leaves the viewer with a feeling that, somewhere, in all of this writing and acting, there is a good film that never quite made it to the screen. Mr. De Niro’s character is an aging once famous television star seeking a comeback as a standup comic. Instead, he becomes a coarse deliverer of smut and insult that makes his audiences (both on and off the screen) squirm in discomfort and, in comparison, makes Don Rickles look like Mother Teresa. Mr. De Niro, as always, radiates a likeable persona but even that wonderful trait cannot save the film from earning only a 5 rating. He, Mr. Hackford and the writers could have done much more with the seeds of a good idea that never quite grew into a worthy flower of entertainment."" ]"

Ably performed by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the film tells the story of an aspiring actress and a dedicated jazz musician as they search to find and realize each of their respective dreams. Ms. Stone and Mr.Gosling have never been seen or known as singers or dancers so the viewer is at first suspect and in doubt that either of these two can properly fulfill the roles the parts demand. To the surprise and satisfaction of all involved, they are a delight to watch and listen to as they seque from drama to musical numbers all in a subtle and lovely transition. This also lends to the credibility of the film and its story under the able direction of Mr. Chazelle. The film also provides the viewer with a delightful series of songs and jazz sessions which add to the positive experience. I give this film a 9 for it is not only a sweet, simple and charming story of hope and ambition in the City of Los Angeles but a reminder that good films can still be made using the once forgotten formulae of mid-20th‘century moviemaking."" ]"

Although some have unfairly characterized the movie as “Disney does the Holocaust”, the film nevertheless communicates the trauma and severity of this difficult time in Polish history and how some brave individuals risked everything to protect the lives of their countrymen, regardless of religious or cultural differences.

Also starring Kevin Costner, the film is based on the book by Margo Lee Shetterly with a noteworthy screenplay co-written by director Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder. This movie describes the abuses and mental hardships that these ladies had to undergo, endure and ultimately overcome while tending to the task of aiding their country in its time of need. Set in the early 1960’s against the background of Reverend King and the others who were fighting for civil rights, the film brings home the plight of this victimized minority when even using a coffeemaker or restroom in the NASA compound became an issue. Yet, throughout all of these indignities and humiliations, these women persevered and performed above and beyond all expectations even surpassing at times the supposedly talented white engineers and the newly introduced IBM computer that NASA was so heavily relying upon. Perhaps the view of two elderly African American ladies with their young granddaughters sitting in the row in front of me in the theater made me realize how significant and important this film is because it showed us all, including those little girls seated in front of me, how tenacity, talent and dignity can conquer adversity and help those with such qualities achieve the accolades and acknowledgments properly due them.   When one sees a film about the Holocaust, the question often arises as to how many great minds were lost in this mass horror.

I mention the matrimonial  ties between the producer and the writer/director because ,were it not for that, I doubt if any other film producer would invest in such a project. The film is thin both in terms of substance and character development and, quite simply, is nothing more than a view of French scenery on  a road trip to Paris with gourmet dining along the way. As with most French specialty dishes, the presentation is more appealing than the amount of food to be digested and the analogy applies to this film as well. How many plates of appetizing food and rare wines can one member of the audience absorb in the 92 minutes it takes for the couple to arrive at their destination. Ms. Lane and Mr. Viard are fine actors and do their best with the limited material given them but, unfortunately, the audience, like Ms. Lane’s character, would have wanted the trip to Paris to have been faster and with fewer gastronomical stops. I give this film  1 star  with a suggestion that theaters offer free Tums or Rolaids with each ticket. Better still, just as “Paris Can Wait’, the viewer might be advised to do so too, at least until the film is ultimately exhibited on TV (if a non-Coppola entity will air it)."" ]"

The film is shallow in terms of the depth of its characters and relies much upon careful and intense following of the dialogue to try to piece together what has previously occurred in the lives of its main characters and the events that led up to the criminal investigation. Since the credits on the film appear at its end, I guessed correctly that it had been written and directed by the same person who, unfortunately, didn’t satisfactorily fulfill either role.

She appears on screen about 30-40 minutes into the film and steals every scene from everyone in the film for the rest of the film. No way do you want to get her teed off in a comic club because no matter how tall or big you are you aren’t going to win! Don’t you dare hurt her daughter because you will get her wrath, sneers and coldness but show her daughter love and with one gesture you know you will never be able to do anything wrong again. I certainly hope she is remembered at award time."", ""Yes Kumail Nanjiani is playing himself, even being called Kumail, but you get to know more than the comedian.

With Medusa like hair, a chipped tooth, scraggly beard, tattoos and with a tan that is golden on his chiseled body you can see that bongo playing bad boy through the aging face. As the titled not quite so heroic  lead on the run for killing a man and with that man’s father (Joe Don Baker), and bounty hunters tracking him down, Mud turns to his father-like figure Tom (Sam Shepard) and two 14 year old  boys Ellis (Tye Sheridan) along with Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) for help. Tom warns the boys that Mud is nothing but a liar and all of his failures have been due to his love of Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) who he is now looking to hook up with again, run away and start a new life."", """", ""With a strong supporting cast along with Baker and Shepard there are Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson as Ellis’s parents, Michael Shannon as Neckbone’s uncle and Bonnie Sturdivant as a possible girlfriend for Ellis, though she doesn’t see it, McConaughey holds his own and the audiences attention but this film revolves around the boys. They are coming of age and all that brings including seeing the so many different ways of love among adults."", """", ""With all that this film is very disappointing for many reasons but the major one is that director and screenwriter Jeff Nichols tries to handle too many themes and in turn has a 2 hour and 10 minute film that would have been a lot better at one hour and 45 minutes.  Though the relationship between McConaughey and Witherspoon is vital to the movie it is given short shrift and the latter very little screen time.

I would like to see her tackle a deeper role as her Molly in her hit TV sitcom certainly shows a lot more depth as an actress than her movie roles. As it is she becomes very irritating each time she uses the “F” words, and forms of it, and it would make for s super drinking game as it seems every other word or motion starts with F.

This movie succeeds  though not due to the script by Katie Dippold or the direction by Paul Feig but by the antics of Bullock supported by McCarthy.  It is almost as if the two actresses got up in front of the camera for 2 hours and improvised what they could come up with.

He also errs in writing the character Fay (Gillian Jacobs) completely unnecessary to the film and making Eloise’s math tutor and piano teacher, Duvan (Mpho Koaho)  multilingual, speaks only 8 languages, seems to have written published papers on almost all subjects talked about, just a little bit too much though he does supply some humor."", ""Though there is nothing special regarding his direction of the movie the acting is strong all around with star turns by both Octavia Spencer and Kevin Costner while Jillian Estell, as the 7 year old, is cute at the right times, playful at others and serious enough when she is required to be.

For the next hour and 17 minutes we see how uncle and nephew interact and deal with life, Patrick with humor and sarcasm, Lee without emotions and staying as uninvolved as he can stay. We meet Patrick's mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) who has been out of his life for years, her new husband Jefferey (Matthew Broderick) Lee's ex-business partner and friend George (C. J. Wilson) but most important of all Lee's ex-wife, Randi (Michelle Williams)."", ""While Affleck is getting all the attention in the reviews I was more impressed with 20 year old Lucas Hedges as the 16 year old who can break your heart and a second later having you laugh. Affleck does a strong job especially since most of his scenes have to be done in a monotone, showing no emotion and fighting the pull his nephew on has him as a human being."", ""Michelle Williams has a very emotional scene, lasting about 5 minutes, with Casey Affleck but as easily as I am moved in a movie's emotionally scenes, this didn't move me."", ""Gretchen Mol is wasted and Matthew Broderick has a very thankless part. The rest of the supporting players including  Patrick's main girlfriend played by Anna Baryshnikov are all above par."", ""I love heavy, family, movie dramas but the bottom line is that \""Manchester by the Sea\"" is way too long by 15-20 minutes which doesn't make for very much tension and though the scenery of Manchester by the Sea is excellent in all the seasons and there is no fault with the acting I don't recommend it."", ""Oh, yes, a very distracting soundtrack that more than once takes you out of the story."" ]"

That's the only way it could possibly have happened. There was far too much (\""you have to be kidding\"" under the audiences breath throughout the movie) to make this movie real. The last shot was the final slap in the face. Picture this, one more shot of L.C. looking into the lens with nice clear, rested blue eyes, and then fade to black. Always a good way to end a movie by having the main character starring into the lens. That makes us all feel so warm and fuzzy. If the movie gets any awards, it should only be for sound and photography.

Then the artistic style, while it scores high with anyone who plays the games it's so outlandish and cartoony that I could see it being a turn off for those who don't. Some of the acting was great like Durotan, Lothar and Medivh, but some was pretty awful like basically everyone else. It general it's the problem with video game films is that they try and fail to capture the scope of the game. They need to narrow their focus to a single narrative or this will continue to happen.

I liked it a lot, a good mix of action and backstory and a good conflict. It was really interesting to me because while marvel heroes are always painted as distinctly good guys, here you have superman who is revered by some but hated by others. Despite being completely different, batman too faces the same moral questions as superman as he is viewed as a vigilante. It's just very interesting how different the heroes are they both face the exact same paradox of balancing the good, like how batman wants to kill superman initially and at the same time superman sees batman as a criminal operating outside the law basically. The only part of the movie I didn't like was how batman so quickly changed his mind about superman just cus they told him how Lex was manipulating the situation.

This film is imho on equal par with Alien and Aliens in terms of pure excellence, quality and entertainment.  The story has many layers, interwoven so successfully and ties into the original Alien very well.  I can understand the many poor reviews here, but really, any film that tackles the origin of mankind is up against all odds; but Scott did justice to the film, the franchise, all while entertaining.  There are many unanswered questions but Scott did this intentionally to make the viewers think - it was done right and made me appreciate the film even more. You also need to have watched Alien to truly appreciate this film.  The one and only draw back of Prometheus is the crew - i.e a mission into space of this caliber and of historical importance would require a team of top professionals, no less.  Very much not in this case, but the character David stole the spot light - just spectacular character building.   I do hope there will be a director's cut to give more insight into the film - there is easily 30 min of story telling that would make this film even more complete.  I saw this in regular 3D and now plan to see it again but in IMAX 3D.  The visuals and the cinematography are simply jaw dropping.  I truly hope that an IMAX version comes out on blu-ray.

The only slight negative I would give is the soundtrack by Zimmer and XL - although incredible and a key to providing a massive impact to the films roller coaster atmosphere, id say it is not quite as epic and focused as the score from Man of Steel - but that is a tall order to beat.

IMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he’s surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen."", ""But back to the movie at hand. „Get Out“ is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele’s ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set. If I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller. There’s a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it’s like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every \""chess piece\"" is moved and how the others react."", ""In addition, there’s an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn’t have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements. Peele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn’t feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels."", ""If I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of „Curb Your Enthusiasm“ or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act."", ""But all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because „Get Out“ is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening.

I’d even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times."", ""There are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle.

Jarmusch’s stories are slooooooow, they are not so much about specific events and dialogue than the lead characters’ state of mind or chosen way of being, which is often illustrated by recurring events and details. In this context, some of his projects are „easier“, such as „Paterson“, and some one you wouldn’t really imagine yourself watching twice, even if you liked it, such as 2009’s „The Limits of Control“."", ""Having called „Paterson“ one of Jarmusch’s „easier“ movies doesn’t mean that it’s mainstream-friendly. It’s still very much a slow, meditative experience where little happens, basically the main event is shown multiple times with little variations, there’s not much dialogue or many different characters. Also, I did not symphatize with Paterson’s unconditional admiration for her wife. And I loved the movie! Goes to my personal „best of 2016“ list for sure."", ""So, how did Jarmusch take a story about almost nothing and make it one of the best-reviewed American movies of last year? Like stated above, the god is in the details. Jarmusch’s style of presenting everything – creating mise en scène to put it in technical terms – is so captivating, efficient and powerful that I can’t couldn’t help but watch with interest from the very first seconds. Every little thing can be interesting or, for example, funny, just because how Jarmusch has decided to show it. And nothing on screen is meaningless or trivial. He is not the only famous American director with a penchant of concentrating on fascinating details instead of extensive story and dialogue – Wes Anderson is pretty popular, too – but he sure is one of the great masters of it. And somehow it works for creating and maintaining suspense through long two hour movie (OK, for this, the music is used efficiently too). If you like „Paterson“, you like it just because how it feels. It’s not flashy in any way, and there are no big „Oscar moments“. The result is very much like life itself: it has a deeper spiritual message but one that is not carried to you on a silver platter. If you choose not to uncover or recognize it, you will not get it. And there’s nothing wrong with not getting it either. You get it when you’re ready. If not, then you’re not ready, and hearing about it wouldn’t help you. (The hint is in the beginning of this review, by the way.)"", ""The actors are part of the puzzle, not meant to stand out specifically. But the performances are good and Adam Driver as Paterson is a rising star for sure. I love him from HBO’s „Girls“ already and am happy to see him now having leading roles in movies also. He’s also Kylo in the new „Star Wars“ trilogy if somebody cares about that."" ]"
bleed-for-this;8;1;KaptenVideo;"[ ""Feeling the lack is the first step to greatness. If you’re fine with status quo you may never achieve something bigger. I’m pretty sure I have read something like this somewhere. At least it’s a fitting motto to „Bleed for This“, the sports movie about this real-life young boxing champ who broke his neck and still managed to get back in form and claim another world champion belt. More than that, Wikipedia says that he held it for over the next ten years. The guy’s called Vinny Paz and he’s 54 now, by the way."", ""So yes, it’s another sports movie aiming „to the infinity and beyond“… but it doesn’t go all Hollywood on our asses and actually manages to be a really good indie watch, having both heart and balls."", ""„Bleed for This“ came out back in September and circled some festivals before reaching cinemas. The commercial success of the movie, sadly, hasn’t been worthy of its tough-as-nails hero. It pretty much came and disappeared without a splash and hasn’t gotten any award nominations either, big or small. Quite why the producers and distributors didn’t believe in the project enough to support it some, for Globes and Academy Awards campaign, at least, is beyond my comprehension. It’s a true underdog story, also a sports movie – who doesn’t like those, eh? – and also good movie in general. (Probably the post-Trumpian USA needs more unpretentious happy tales like „La La Land“ which has just managed to pick 7 out of 7 Globes.)"", ""OK but what makes „Bleed for This“ so great, then? Isn’t there enough underdog and sports movies, award-winning or otherwise? Well, I am glad you asked. In short, I like everything about it! The indie style, the atmosphere and feeling of the early 1990’s working class USA, the great group of starring actors, the hardhitting boxing, the screenplay…"", ""The result is not perfect – what is, anyway? – and one could nitpick about many things if wanted to. For example, the movie runs near two hours which is not exactly a short amount of time… but one does not get a good sense of Vinny Paz’s development as a champion sportsman, or even exactly how the recovery from the big accident went. Of course, it’s all explained in passing, but it doesn’t satisfy to the fullest."", ""Maybe it’s just me because I enjoyed visiting Vinny’s world, family and environment so much that I left the cinema wanting more. „Bleed for This“ is one of those rather uncommon sports movies that is not afraid to let characters and story breathe and develop enough to lure us in, to make us want really be there for the characters, not just flashy action."", ""This kind of intimate connection to the movie mostly happens when its makers have strong personal connection with the whole thing too. Seeing that Ben Younger is the director and the sole writer, we can assume it was a personal project and he makes the most out of everybody on screen."", ""The big name actors here are Miles Teller as Vinny Paz, Ciarán Hinds as his father (somehow I always confuse the guy with Alfred Molina) and Aaron Eckhart as his boxing trainer. All the others have given good performances too, but these three are really worth every penny the producers had to spend on them. Which was probably not too much because the budget was about 6 million US dollars and shooting lasted for only 24 days."", ""They play it rough and raw, turning the characters into believable working-class heroes. Mark Wahlberg would have probably loved to be part of this experience. There are no showoff scenes so there’s not much to talk about it, only enjoy it. Feel it, live it, breathe it!"", ""I am especially happy about Aaron Eckhart choosing a worthwhile acting role again for a change. For most of the current decade, he has been doing boring commercial crap which is a world away from the works that made him known in the first place. Here he seems to channel a younger less fat version of James Gandolfini which is enough for me to wish him a Supporting Actor Oscar, or at least a nomination. And last but certainly not the least, „Bleed for This“ cements Miles Teller’s position as one of the most promising young American movie actors of his generation. You almost remember him from big studio projects „Divergent“ + „Insurgent“ and 2015’s „Fantastic Four“ but he has also starred in a row of cool indie-er movies such as „The Spectacular Now“ and „Whiplash“. The former quirky cool guy has transformed himself for the never-surrender-type boxer role but manages to turn what on paper seems like a cartoon character into living breathing human being. He should also get nominated for Oscar."", ""\""Bleed for This\"" doesn't offer a biggest amount of boxing I have seen in a boxing movie. But I just read from IMDb that Teller was trained by Darrell Foster, who has trained fighters like Sugar Ray Leonard and helped Will Smith become Muhammad Ali for 2001's Ali."" ]"

He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it. And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits."", ""It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney."", ""The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along. Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean."", ""But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi \""Arrival\"", and now this. Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago."", ""Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?"", ""PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on.

But the result works well, everything is in its right place and there's always enough entertainment."", ""The plot and the characters are really thin, to make room for the big setpieces.

This way, it's a functional if uneasy viewing which makes you fathom something bigger lurking somewhere around the corner but not quite appreciate it fully."", ""On deeper level it's about how difficult it really is to be flexible to the world and life around us. It's very human to long for freedom and try to place everything in boxes at the same time."", ""The deeper meaning here can unfold by relying on several different frameworks – psychoanalytical, just intellectual or spiritual / symbolic. The viewer's personal approach will, of course, be highly dependent on one's general world view, be it esoteric or rational (all things are ultimately explainable by science and reason), or somewhere in between. I say \""American Pastoral\"" is most enjoyable from spiritual viewpoint. Actions and the behaviour of the characters make the most sense and seems most understandable and human, if one concentrates on WHY we do things we do. If one only view causal relationships – he/she did it because of the past event x or y – the whole story loses a lot of its colours and shades."", ""The real magic here is how Ewan McGregor, with the help of all his cast and crew, has managed to make the movie work on every level you choose to see it. One may not particularly enjoy approaching \""American Pastoral\"" just rationally as many critics have done. But the movie still has a strong sure sense of style, both in visuals and storytelling. This also works on two levels. Some see the movie as comical and theatrical, and characters as caricatures. At the same time, all this can convey so much emotion and sharp little observations about everyday life and relationships, that one can't help but be delighted during at least some moments. Just like reading a good spiritual book. I liked all the actors and Ewan McGregor is my long-time favorite. But especially powerful are Dakota Fanning and Valorie Curry, both evil and innocent at the same time."", ""It's not often that movie manages to talk to me so directly and arouse emotions so strong as \""American Pastoral\"" did. This is one of my big favorites from 2016 so far. It may surprise that McGregor has such a sure hand as a first-time director of a complex movie. But he has always been versatile and has starred in similarly dark and complex movie already, 2003's forgotten little gem \""Young Adam\""."", ""What DOES surprise is the fact that McGregor was not the original director and the man behind all this. As a director, he stepped in at the last minute after Philip Noyce left the production!"", ""I have planned on reading the works of Philip Roth for over ten years or so. Still haven't done it somehow. After seeing \""Pastoral\"", I want to do it even more."", ""* I know, McGregor has also co-directed 1999's \""Tube Tales\"" but he only had a segment in anthology movie. \""American Pastoral\"" can be still called his real debut as a movie director."" ]"

I would have liked a more rounded view of Seretse's sister and how she eventually came to care for Ruth.

The introduction to the heroine and her group of friends in the first 25 minutes was tedious, and I had no interest in any of them - but the film became more interesting with each round.  We learn the back stories for the main characters, and the heroine's transformation is believable.  The end of the film genuinely surprised me, but it was foreshadowed by the narration.

The McDonald brothers are the inventors, who have tried to franchise their restaurant but were unsuccessful.  Kroc figures out how to do this, but along the way his determination turns to ambition and greed.  This is an interesting look at why the marketers, not the inventors, frequently succeed in our economy.  The McDonald brothers are the most sympathetic characters, but McDonald's would never have become what it is today without Kroc."", ""This is also an interesting look at the young Joan Kroc, Ray's second wife, who is known to many San Diegans as the former owner of the Padres, patron of the arts, and philanthropist."" ]"

It takes place mainly in the 50's and concerns Troy Maxon, former Negro League baseball player now trash collector, his wife Rose, two sons and brain damaged war veteran brother.  Denzel does a great job as Troy, who is not a totally sympathetic person, but the movie belongs to Viola Davis as his long-suffering wife.  Yes, it is obviously an adaptation of a play, but the dialogue is terrific and all the characters are realistic and well-rounded.  Kudos should also be given to the actor portraying his brother.

Their case voided all the miscegenation laws still on the books in the south.  The acting of the two main characters was superb, and I was riveted to the screen, even though I knew how it would all turn out.

It's somewhat unbelievable that anybody could be caught in their scam (i.e. the Latino posing as an Arab).

MM visits nine countries in total, some of them expected (France and Norway) and some not expected at all (like Slovenia and Tunisia).    I found myself wanting to know more about some things, like exactly how the Finnish educational system works.  I also wanted to visit the French elementary school that serves these wonderful gourmet meals!

There is an interesting female alien in this story, and the main Star Trek cast is a pleasure to see.  Yet the plot doesn't really hold water.  This seems more like a generic action movie, rather than a real Star Trek film.  The best of Star Trek provided good characters with even the villains having realistic motivation, and maybe even a moral to the story.  In this film, the rationale for the Enterprise to rescue the crew of the damsel in distress doesn't seem right.

Unfortunately, Casey Affleck never really experiences any personal growth, and ends the film the same as he started.  Matthew Broderick is totally wasted in a cameo role.  The scenery is beautiful, but the film is way too slow moving."" ]"

The film is well-made - although most of the film is chronological, it wisely starts out with Coltrane's stint with Miles Davis and his effort to kick the heroin habit.  This is not a concert film, but there are many excerpts of Coltrane's music, including in-concert footage.  Coltrane did no TV interviews, and I was told that his radio interviews were of poor quality (and therefore not used), but Denzel Washington does a great job of narrating Coltrane's written words.  Most of the interviews were enlightening, and the interviews in Japan put Coltrane's last concert (in Japan) into context with his views on life.  All jazz fans should see this film, and others should also give it a chance."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;10;1;NedRyerson1;"[ ""Nocturnal Animals another amazing job of Amy Adams in 2016, a tricky police thriller, filled with suspense, which requires an active viewer who gathers pieces to solve the puzzle. The story is constructed with three fragments: the life of Susan as she reads a manuscript from her ex-husband; the story that tells the book; and the events that surrounded the divorce. Each fragment has its own intrigue worthy of having an individual movie, but here they blend perfectly, jumping from one to other, enriching the next sequences. The protagonists are developed in a very realistic form, with respect but not gently at all, we reach the center of each one, you get to know what moves them, what hunts them, which are their profound desires. As the plot reveals the conflict you realize that not everything is white and black, while one character emerges the other collapses. The secondary roles are not forgotten; everyone has their own struggles, that are independent of the main conflict, but leads them to participate. All these thoughts and feelings are sublimated at the end, in a visceral scene marked by a lack of empathy that is breathtaking. Amy Adams is marvelous, one the best performance of her career, the way she moves, her expressions, skin tone and eyes from a person with the fatigue of living many lives.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron Tyler-Johnson and Michael Shannon are stunning too. The photography and music accompany the purpose of the film."" ]"

Every detail is perfectly calculated to demonstrate what life truly is; from what they eat to the appearance of the mother. It is very interesting the dynamic of the film, because the protagonist lives with every single problem that a human could have, which by the way gather all the complicated issues of contemporary society; but continue living only escaping from the reality, to a world where she is famous, everybody loves her, with the perfect boyfriend and a careful and lovely mother. Because of that the picture is constructed within three worlds, the horrible present (the movie), the repressed past (in flashbacks) and the fantastic other reality (breaking the flashbacks). That is why especial technical aspects are used to narrate the story, like slow motion shots, changes in illumination and audio-visual counterpoint (when in a fight it sounds quiet music). Another captivating thing is the evolution of the protagonist in the story, showing that is possible to take every little thing that happen to you, without mattering if is either good or bad, and learn something about it, because things happen for a reason.  Lee Daniels definitely made a masterpiece, the screenplay is astonishing and the performance of the cast is amazing. I mean Gabourey Sidibe is awesome, but MoNique is heartbreaking, one of the best performances I ever seen in my life.

her;10;1;NedRyerson1;"[ ""Her is probably the most original and captivating romantic film that I have ever seen in my whole life. The idea of a man that falls in love with an OS is exceptional but not so strange as it sounds, because in the society that we live the technology is like air, we can't live without it; and probably in a nearby future a relationship between human and computer would be possible. This thing makes the movie so unique; there have been lots of films about the future, but Her shows one that actually could happen. The message that is hidden below is about something that the protagonist does and that sometimes we also do it, which is to take shelter in the technology because of the fear to face the reality. That explains the job that Theodore has, why he is passing throw a divorce and also why he is so lonely. In addition to him there is Samantha, the voice of the OS, the amazing thing about her is that she is discovering the world, learning of life experiences and evolving as a consequence. I still cannot believe how Scarlett Johansson manage to transmit these, you can feel the wonder in her voice, how she test human feelings and her reaction when those things overwhelm her.

I also couldn't help but think of the films of Terrence Malick in the way he visually and sonically puts the audience into the setting in a way unlike any other and creates the experience via purely cinematic  means with little if any dialogue.  Malick's work however poetic is short on plot (often to its great detriment), and so is this to an extent.  There is no question the filmmakers here are influenced by his work, which is not to say they aren't original in their own right.  This movie is stunningly photographed and expertly edited.  The score is subtlety, hauntingly effective without being over-bearing.  The surround sound is more pronounced than in most movies, even the biggest.  The visual effects are of perhaps the best variety, you don't even realize the extent to which you are seeing them.

To me that was the very best a big Hollywood movie can be because it got me completely swept up in the emotion of it.  It's ultimately always emotion that wins at the end of the day.  Emotion is art's greatest aspiration and achievement.  While there is some here certainly brought forth by the fine actors, it's not the kind of emotional experience that stayed with me long after leaving the theatre which is ultimately the only true test of a great movie whether it's funny and you're telling jokes about it later or haunted in your sleep thereafter.  I'm not saying it hasn't stayed with me, just that it's scaled comparatively to what I know is possible."", ""Another movie this made me think of was \""First Blood\"" (10) in that it features a similar kind of relentless chase for the duration and a will to survive against the harshest environment and maybe even harsher people."", """", ""Note to filmmakers:  Look at this film style wise in how it uses a moving camera.  The camera is almost constantly moving in rugged exterior environments yet is always smooth.  It isn't shaky even amidst rough, intense action.  It's called steadicam and there is never, ever any excuse if you have any kind of budget to have that stupid shaky handheld camera style!  It is only acceptable used as POV and for short durations, not as style for an entire feature!  As I continually rant, our eyes do not see that way contrary to the mentality of those who choose that method, so it is not more real but less so!  You can cut fast but don't ever go both handheld shaky and cut it to ribbons for extra intensity when really all you are doing is losing the viewer in something that can't be followed and is subliminally known to be cheated (like the second two Bourne movies which someday will appear very dated I believe).

Most interesting is the great contemporary insight from the likes of Scorsese and Fincher among others.

star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens;7;1;AxeT;"[ ""In interviews both J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy talk about the task of decoding and recapturing the original \""Star Wars\"".  The director says he wanted most of all to create for today's audience that same feeling of awe the original did for him as a kid (who hired to helm this property wouldn't?).  This movie probably has done it as well as can be done.  The bad news is it simply cannot truly be done short of retread.  When the revolutionary original came out in 1977 it set new standards creatively, technically, and as a business model.  Sci-fi movies weren't anything new, but taken to that aesthetic level and to such stratospheric success surely was.  It created a new space fantasy sub-genre and never had it been so much fun or inspiring at the movies!  Flash forward 38 years and thousands of genre movies, TV shows, video games, graphic novels, merchandising galore (ad nauseum), etc. and you have to ask yourself before getting your hopes up too high:  How can a new Star Wars ever match the experience anybody (at any age) felt when they saw the first one in the late seventies, those that got it that is?  The answer is it cannot, just as the prequels no matter how popular with the youth at the time could not attain that level of newness again.  It's about the times we live in.  Just think of the sheer endless volume of entertainment choices kids have today whereas decades ago going to a blockbuster movie was more of a big deal.  Since then the ever evolving sophisticated VFX spectacle offerings have been increasingly the norm.  Even by the time of \""Return of the Jedi\"" in 1983 this was becoming evident.  Another factor is you cannot replicate the unknown, against all odds irreverent kind of moviemaking enterprise it began as after it becomes the most successful franchise of all time.  They did it once, but by the time of the prequels Lucas was so powerful and revered that the actors were probably too timid to challenge anything he wanted.  So with all the money and means still at hand but different people in charge now, how did this one turn out?"", """", ""Its production value is as huge as expected and the style is thankfully in unison with the previous chapters.  J.J.'s solid touch and fresh energetic visual approach work for the storytelling not instead of it.  The right dose of humor is there.  Ford is good (though I expected more from the character) while the new cast is completely interchangeable with any of hundreds of other young actors.  The villain is miscast.  There is no doubt this movie was cast with a marketing agenda for diversity.  Now does that make it more realistic or do those obvious strategic maneuvers behind the scenes hinder character depth and take you out of the story?  It's debatable.  The main problem is halfway through I realized I've seen it all before!  It's the same plot basically as the original with all the same flourishes updated to today's cinematic standards.  It feels extremely calculated rather than original and of its own.  Well that's pretty much what every sequel and reboot is.  Bigger is more but rarely do they capture the original magic or expand upon it.  The real magic goes back to these characters we love and how we felt when we first encountered them.  For that matter I'm not sure I even want to see where they are thirty years later just as I wasn't thrilled to actually see what came before the original trilogy.  I sure thought I would be, but after it was executed the original itself became forever tainted.  When you show the back story or the after story, it inherently kills some of the offscreen mystery we all individually fill in with our own minds.  Star Wars is completely geared for episodic sequels though, and this one is probably right on the money (yeah $!) as far as what the studio wanted."", ""The genius of the original was nobody was asking for it.  It was an unknown.  The genius of the first sequel was it stayed true but also added new depth and dark textures.  Here it's one big nostalgia fest with a sheen of high spectacle gloss.  They didn't take any chances.  Instead of focusing on an original story the script makes sure to connect the dots.  This checklist formulaic mentality is ruining big tent pole movies these days which leave me bored and only admiring of the incredible artifice of it all not the movie itself, and that aspect is incredible here if not that old inimitable magic."", """", ""The look is far superior to the prequels yes (I don't fault George for pushing digital though, and all his critics fail to realize he will ultimately go down as an innovator of the entire medium rather than an artist working within it like say Spielberg).

Nothing special there, and if this is all the movie remains for you, more impressive movies can certainly be found. But even on a first viewing it should be obvious that there is another story being told that reaches down into the very foundations of western cultural traditions. You`d think reviewers born and raised in the west might notice this therefore. No such luck!"", ""To mention all the symbolism, religious and cultural references contained in Sunshine is not easy; indeed I may not even have noticed them all. But from the basic allegory of the Sun as truth/God/creating force present in the Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Christian traditions, many of them are so evident I squirm with embarrassment on behalf of those who fail to notice even any of it."", ""The first is the ship in which they travel, named Icarus after the Greek mythological figure who flew too close to the Sun so his wings fell off. As with everything else this is not a literal event being retold, but an allegory regarding the force of truth/God and the futility of trying to become God. If the entire movie is viewed as an allegory of the search for truth, you could easily see that most reviewers would need very powerful sunglasses indeed. If this is correct though, the gatekeeper of truth is the movie`s nemesis, Penbacker, who seeks to destroy the Icarus and prevent the crew from reigniting the Sun, by killing them all. Like a Syrian pillar hermit he has spent seven years close to God (the Sun) and presumes to have understood the futility of denying the death of God (truth), and aggressively seeks to prevent anyone from reigniting the Sun/remaking God/finding truth."", ""The actual bomb is triggered from a cross-shaped scaffolding. The cross was traditionally a symbol of the rebirth of God, even before Christianity. Around this cross is a square, representing order. Logically then, as the bomb goes off and God (The Sun) is reborn on the Cross,  the main character (Capo) transcends, is reborn as God and a new order begins."", ""This is why the ending to the movie is the way it is. Not to be weird but to tell an allegorical story about God/truth/rebirth. To the allegorical illiterates in this weird society this is all nonsense of course, and Sunshine is a bad movie because it`s not simple enough for them."", """", ""I could obviously talk more about all this, and it would be nice if at least one conversation about Sunshine would. Some people detest allegory and wouldn`t recognize a cultural symbol if it jumped up and gave them a haircut, which is perfectly fine. But it might be helpful if the people criticizing this splendid movie understood what an allegory is at least. Personally I firmly believe that certain things can`t be properly communicated without them, as my puny attempts to verbalize them here should illustrate, and I feel that movies with allegorical depth are the only ones that ever become classics. Much the same can be said of literature. And if it`s allegorical depth you want you can`t find a better movie than Sunshine. I defiantly vote 10!"" ]"
the-fountain;9;1;Skulb;"[ ""Sometimes being intelligent is a problem, which Aronovsky found out when he released The Fountain.

But they can be safely ignored as usual."", """", ""The Fountain is presented as three separate alternating stories, with Hugh Jackman leading all three of them, and Rachel Weiss with him in two of them. The first is presumably in the present, where Jackman is a biologist who is trying to save his dying wife by experimenting on monkeys. The second is set in the 1500s, with Jackman as a conquistador looking for immortality on behalf of the Spanish queen, and this is actually the book Rachel Weiss`character is writing, a detail many people seem to have missed. And the third is a sort of astral allegory of life and death, and one of the weirdest damn things I`ve seen in a while. But really, all three are the same story, dealing with the same topic from three different angles. The second aspect of this triple allegory is that it is not just multiple angles on the subject of life and death but also represents different levels of reality. Because Weiss` fiction (The conquistador part.) is obviously less real than the present day narrative, the implication is that the astral part of the movie is more real than it. Or in other words that spiritual and conceptual reality is superior to physical reality, which again is superior to fiction. Read some Plato and then watch The Fountain again and you`ll understand this part of it."", ""The result is a tad confusing at first, like time distortions and multiple levels of reality tend to be in movies.

apocalypto;10;2;Skulb;"[ ""Apocalypto is a beautiful and horrifying movie about a tribe of native Americans which gets raided by the Mayas to be enslaved, painted blue, ritually sacrificed, eaten and who knows what else. It is a virtual descent into hell and back again for the viewer, though nowhere near as persistently hellish as Passion of Christ, as the movie follows the main character while he tries to escape the clutches of the deranged Mayan soldiery. All of it is done using Mayan language, which adds quite a lot of believability to the entire thing. Historically though, the proceedings are a sort of mix between Mayan and Aztec culture, and deliberately so, for reasons I`ll get to."", ""As always I feel myself compelled to use Metacritic to point out allegories in movies, because nobody else is apparently able to notice them. And particularly the \""this isn`t historically accurate\"" people, who have missed every single point about both Passion of Christ and Apocalypto. The reason Gibson used a composite for the imperial culture in Apocalypto is precisely to make it obvious that the movie is not intended to be a docudrama but an allegory of the conflict between power and empire on one side and freedom and natural humanity on the other. It is expected that the viewer notices these simple things to be able to also notice that the entire religious ceremony through which the Mayan elite exercises its power is a farce, a pantomime and a gigantic fraud, and that they all know it up on top of the pyramid, while the subjects down below do not. The whole thing is nothing more than a staged performance of state organized brutality, intended to frighten the peasants."", ""This is the main statement Gibson makes in Apocalypto: that power is a fraud, maintained only through terrorizing the people. But because he is not really talking about Mayas, but about our present western power elite, he distorts it by mixing Aztec and Mayan culture. And this is what should tell us that the movie is a political, philosophical allegory about imperialism and oligarchy, which is not intended to be viewed as a period piece or anything of the sort. Otherwise he would not have blended the cultures see? Like Passion of Christ, Apocalypto tries to deal with the hypocrisy and mass murder at the heart of western civilization, with illegitimate power elites suppressing humanity, justice, freedom and truth, by using lies and violence in order to perpetuate their power. It presents a view on the evils of government as organized violence against the inherent good of man in his natural state. Once you truly understand this you`ll figure out that neither of these two movies are strictly about the subject matters, but are far more profound than that. So that`s why these \""historical inaccuracies that might confuse people\"" are in the movie, and not because \""Gibson doesn`t know how to read a history book\""."", """", ""Apocalypto is an allegory of contemporary oligarchical nonsense like the \""War on Terror\"", the \""War on Drugs\"", and an endless barrage of equally contrived and fake things. In fact, it is an allegory of any rule by lies, fraud, violence, intimidation and public spectacle and above all it is an allegory of good and evil. But if Mel Gibson had made this movie without allegories, he would probably have been shot by the CIA or been sent off to an insane asylum like Hemingway and Pound were. So much for free speech in the United States, and allegories it is then! Too bad most of the public are deaf dumb and blind to those.

The focus was clearly on competition, although 95% of the dancers are not competitors.  It would have been interesting to highlight them more.  The international aspect was mentioned, as was the fact that there is little or no Black participation in the dance any longer. The short segment on Blues dancing was misguided.  Lindyhoppers do not form the core of Blues Dancers and generally do not participate in their weekly events or competitions. Although the video is drawn out, it did hold my attention."" ]"

spider-man-homecoming;7;5;NikolayG;"[ ""Based on the trailers I fully expected Spider-Man Homecoming to be the best of the Spider-Man movies. But that's not the case. Spider-Man 2, wherein Tobey Mcguire battles Doc Ock, remains the best. I can only say that Spider-Man Homecoming is better than Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man movies and better than Spider-Man 3. Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man, but Spider-Man's success depends also on the tried and true characters of the supporting cast. They set up conflict and high emotional stakes. In this new movie, those characters (except Iron Man if he counts) are all absent. Certain characters have the same name, or same initials in MJ's case, but that's all they have in common with their comic book counterparts. Their personalities are entirely different. Cases in point: MJ is a cynical \""whatever\"" kind of kid who one point MJ gives Peter the finger, not a super upbeat extroverted wanna-be actress of the comics. At another point in the movie Aunt May says, \""What the f__k?\"" I hope I don't have to explain that this is totally out of character for Aunt May. Combine these changes with the overdone CGI and all the ridiculous Tony Stark tech built into Peter's suit, and you have a movie that misses the mark in important ways."", ""I agree with most people that Andrew Garfield's movies weren't very good, but they had one thing going for them. The web slinging was very visceral and believable. Spider-Man Homecoming's web slinging scenes made me feel like I was watching a video game."", ""Despite it's serious flaws, the second half of Spider-Man Homecoming is good in its own way, largely because it is kicked off with a conversation between Peter and Liz Allan's dad. Yes, a conversation had everyone on the edge of their seats, not CGI, not fancy Tony Stark Tech. Tobey Mcguire's Spider-Man - despite the absence of Gwen Stacy (as anything more than an afterthought) - was much closer to the comics, and for that reason was more satisfying. I understand we have already seen Spider-Man's origin on screen twice, so I get the urge to skip it with this reboot. But that origin involving the death of Peter Parker's uncle all due to Peter's selfishness, gives the character emotional depth from the get-go that's missing in this latest movie. The age and frailty of the newly widowed Aunt May, for whom Peter is suddenly fully responsible (and one reason he freelances for J. Jonah Jameson at the Daily Bugle, a character who doesn't appear in this movie), also gives psychological depth to Spider-Man as part of its basic architecture. This latest movie jettisons that by making Aunt May a youthful 50-somthing Marisa Tomei, who can clearly take care of herself. Like other characters in this movie with the same names (or initials) as characters in the Spider-Man comics, the name is about all they have in common with their comic book counterparts. A single passing reference regarding Aunt May to \""what she's been through lately\"" doesn't do the trick of building in the depth the other movies have done, especially when Marisa shows no signs of grief and there are no reminders of the uncle anywhere in the home even to suggest he's ever existed. The fact that Aunt May always lived in a house clearly too big for just Aunt May and her nephew, also emphasized the loss. But here she lives in an apartment. Other changes from the comic also defy understanding. In this movie Peter has a crush on Liz Allan unlike the comics where that was reversed, and there is no Gwen Stacy or Harry Osborn, two of the most important supporting characters in the Spider-Man comics. So everything's mixed up in terms of Peter's supporting characters as compared to the comics, and it doesn't work as well. Also Peter has no sense that the one's he loves could be in danger due to his status as Spider-Man. Instead, he's just concerned that Aunt May will disapprove if she learns who he is. So this Peter lacks the intelligence to see that those he loves could be at risk due to his super hero status, something Peter Parker was keenly aware of in the comics and in the Tobey Mcguire movies. Finally, for reasons I just don't get, this version of Spider-Man has no spider sense, which was a great tool for generating a little apprehension in the comic books and Tobey Mcguire movies. All of that said the movie is entertaining, especially in its second half. It's just not the best Spider-Man movie as the trailers made it seem it would be. It's a far lighter, more superficial entertainment with a bunch of missing characters, too much CGI and distracting Tony Stark Tech."" ]"

But the negative 0 and 1 reviews make no sense. I would suggest you take them with a grain of salt. They are suspicious. This movie cannot be argued by any means to have 'flat' acting etc. If I had to bet on it, I'd say those reviews are fakes inserted by someone with an ulterior motive."", ""Wonder Woman succeeds largely because of Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Gal Gadot is a rare actress in appearance and bearing. I can't think of anyone today who could pull off Wonder Woman, especially with such heart while always maintaining a regal quality. Toning down the color of the costume was a good idea. One problem contemporary super hero movies face is, how to make the film without it seeming silly by definition. The way Wonder Woman handles this is by darkening the red and blue of the costume, setting the tale in the grim environment of WW I, and having her co-star as skeptical of her Greek gods-based theory of the world as the audience. The setup, as you likely already know, is that an island of women (Amazons) whose purpose is to protect men from the god of war (something like that anyway) encounters Germans during WWI when an Allied spy (Chris Pine) crashes his plane just off their island and the Germans come looking for him in boats. The Amazons fight them off and Chris Pine tells the women that - outside of their island paradise - the entire world is at war. So Diana, Wonder Woman, goes off with him to London to help end the war. She thinks she can end it by killing the god of war, a single being. Chris Pine has a more modern idea, delivering the intelligence he stole from the Germans to HQ. The rest of the story is Diana's discovery of the world at large, the dirtiness and lack of honor of modern warfare, and the discovery of her own powers, as she and Chris Pine each seek slightly different things together, he to destroy a factory developing a newer deadlier type of mustard gas, and she to locate and kill the god of war."", ""For a super hero movie Wonder Woman has a surprising number of tear-jerker moments, largely due to the  fact that the WWI horrors depicted have a basis in historical fact; it has touches of humor, too, but it could use a little more of that. If the movie has one more significant flaw it is that - at no point do we know the limits of Wonder Woman's powers. So we never know how much danger she is in. I know from the comics that she cannot fly. In fact, as a kid one reason I didn't read Wonder Woman much was because she had an invisible airplane, but while the airplane was invisible, she was not. So the comic was drawn to show her in a sitting position whizzing through the sky, which just looked stupid. There is no invisible airplane in this movie, for that I'm grateful. But my point is - she can't fly, at least not in the comics to my knowledge. And yet in this movie she gets blown up into the sky more than once and descends lightly and slowly, in control, almost as if she can fly. And she leaps so high and far, it's almost as if she can fly. So the question arises, how powerful is she? Can she fly in this movie version? Is she invulnerable? She certainly takes a lot of abuse, explosions and so on, and comes out without a scratch. This is important because a key plot element turns on a decision one character makes to save her life. But at that moment I was not certain at all that her life was in danger, that her life COULD be in danger ever. And so I didn't understand why this decision was made. It was actually about 10 minutes after I left the theater, pondering what I thought was a plot error, that I realized that the decision that was made was necessary in order to save her life but the filmmakers just did a bad job of letting us know what could kill her and what could not. Wonder Woman is about compassion at least as much as she is about power. That's one reason it has so many sad moments as Diana takes in just what this war is doing to people. In fact the ending, in a key way, is a lot like the end of Return of the Jedi (without Ewoks)."", ""Because Wonder Woman 2 will take place in modern times, not WWI (Wonder Woman doesn't age or she ages slowly), Chris Pine won't be in it. If Gal Godot isn't given someone good to act opposite, that sequel could be in trouble. Wonder Woman is so much in earnest all the time, she really needs a co-star to lighten the mood. Ben Afleck's grim bad acting did her no favors in Batman v. Superman. So for the next WW film that's going to be an issue."", ""If the movie rights licensees of DC comics have any sense, they will get Ben Affleck out of the Batman suit and replace him."" ]"

And it was interesting after the introduction of Chris Pratt for maybe 20 minutes, but definitely by the half hour point the story begins to drag and it keeps dragging until the very unrealistic ending. It's hard to explain why this movie is so dull without giving away spoilers, so let me do that. SPOILERS FOLLOW"", ""RIGHT NOW BELOW -- SPOILERS"", ""BIG TIME SPOILERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW"", ""Chris Pratt is in hibernation along with a bunch of other people, on a 120-year journey to a new planet that's been colonized. But a gigantic meteor hits the ship busting through its shields and damages the ship, causing his hibernation pod to malfuction. He wakes up 90 years too soon. He can't get the pod or any unoccupied pod to work to put himself back in suspended animation. He wanders around the gigantic ship entertaining himself with all of its fancy restaurants and amusement arcades, alone, and in the meanwhile falls in love with Jennifer Lawrence. You see all the pods have clear fronts, so you can see the person in them. He spots her in a pod. He reads up on her in the ship database. Falls more in love. And then, after a year of loneliness, he reads a manual about the pods and triggers hers so that she wakes up. Then he runs away quickly so she will think that her pod malfunctioned too. She wakes up and wanders around until she finds Chris Pratt."", ""They fall in love. But then she finds out that he woke her on purpose. She had thought her pod malfunctioned, too, like his. She screams at him. Hates him. Refuses ever to be in the same room with him. Prefers to be alone."", ""The rest of the movie is dedicated to her hating the only person she knows, then to him nearly dying trying to repair the ship (They find out what happened and that the ship is slowly falling apart) and as he drifts out into space having been working on fixing the ship from the outside, she suits up, flies out into space and by the skin of her teeth manages to rescue him. But when she gets him back inside, of course like Snow White, he appears to be dead. She grieves, realizing she will be alone the rest of her life. Then he opens his eyes. And now, of course, she loves him again more than ever."", ""So it's a story of someone falling in love, then being betrayed, then forgiving. Simple as that really underneath all the sci-fi fluff. The last act is dumb, and completely unrealistic, but I won't give it away. But man, I want to, because it is so ridiculous."", ""But with only two people and a robot bartender, and a brief appearance by a crew member who toward the end also wakes up, there is just not nearly enough material to fill 2 hours, not even close. This would have been a great half hour Twilight Zone episode. But a two-hour movie, no. If they were determined against good judgment to make a movie out of this slight story, they should have at least kept it to an hour and a half."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;10;8;NikolayG;"[ ""One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I don't get the people who say it's pretentious. I guess they just don't like art dealers. I also don't get the people who say it takes swipes at conservatives. That is hilarious considering the entire point of the movie, which was apparently completely lost on that reviewer, reflects a quite conservative point of view. One reviewer in a positive way compares this movie to Gone Girl. If you hated Gone Girl and thought it was garbage as I did, have no fear. The story of this movie is nothing at all like the ridiculous plot of Gone Girl. A woman is married to a handsome guy who cheats on her like there's no tomorrow, and she knows it. She receives a novel manuscript that has been accepted for publication from her ex-husband, whom she did not believe in as a writer at all and whom she left for the handsome guy she is now married to. As she reads his manuscript it is acted out on screen - and it's great - and by the very end when she goes to a restaurant to meet her ex, the whole thing comes together. If you like disturbing well-acted thrillers, if you liked Deliverance for example, you will like Nocturnal Animals. I don't want to say more and give it away except that the novel that's acted out involves violent crime in the southwest, creepy criminals right out of Truman Capote's, In Cold Blood, a desperate husband and a very crusty old detective -- and acting of the highest quality. Of the movies I have digitally rented over the years, I have actually then gone on to purchase maybe half a dozen total, of which this is one."" ]"
jason-bourne;6;4;NikolayG;"[ ""Eh, it was OK. You might want to wait and rent it. My expectations of home rentals are lower, so if you're like me in that way, you'll enjoy it more at home. When you actually go out, park somewhere, stand in line, pay for a ticket, and stand in line again to pay for overpriced popcorn, then sit with someone's head partly in the way, you expect more for your trouble. The best Bourne movies for me are the first one and the 4th one, the one Bourne isn't even in. This one is on par with 3 but maybe not as good as 2. The problem I had with this is that, look, I know I'm not going to get tons of character development, but in place of that I at least want a plot with revelations and twists and turns. But you get none of that here. You just get a simple excuse for a plot with 3 or 4 words of dialogue once in a while to push the thin plot onward, but 99% of the movie is insane action, and in this case the camerawork was so close up all the time that it was disorienting and a little nausea inducing like the Blair Witch Project. The Blair Witch Project promoters liked to brag that viewers were throwing up in the theater - which suggested the movie was incredibly gross and frightening - but in fact people were puking because the camera work was hand-held and looking at the ground half the time and jiggling and bumping all over so that people got sea sick. Jason Bourne isn't that bad visually but it's pretty bad. Handheld cameras and close shots even during action are fine as a tool in the toolbox to use here and there to get very intense, to highlight a climactic, moment, but when you do it all the time it becomes just a meaningless blur, and that was kind of what you had here. That said, the acting, what there was of it, was good. Perhaps I give it a 6 rather than a 4 or 3 simply because I've seen the previous Bournes so I knew what I was in for when I entered the theater. I'm calibrating it against other Bourne movies rather than against other action movies generally."" ]"

Listen, this is a fine rental when the price comes down but don't pay top dollar in the theater to see it. The novel may have been better, but here is the problem with the movie. Actually, there are three: First, the theme the director discusses in the \""extras\"" is just not there. It was either never in the script or it got cut out after it was filmed. Every story, even an action movie or thriller, is best when it has a psychological dimension. Here, the fledgling relationship between the main couple was meant to create that dimension. The movie opens in Marrakesh. The husband feels like he's not a real man anymore. His wife's career is soaring. He's lost. He stumbles across this Russian mafia guy trying to turn good by smuggling secret information out of Marakesh to London (There's more to the mafioso's reasons than that, but I don't want to create a spoiler). The husband decides to help the mafioso, in order to give his life purpose and feel like someone who matters. But I'm making all this up about the husband, his motivation, because it's not there in the movie. I just know that it's supposed to be because of what I was told in the \""extras\"" feature. But it should be in the actual movie, not only in the extras. The couple and their issues and the husband's sense of inadequacy never come across directly or indirectly, by dialogue or action. Unless a vacant stare of five seconds by Ewan McGregor is supposed to be sufficient. It's not. Big miss there."", """", ""Problem number two: I will be vague so as not to create any spoiler. Someone hides away in a very good place, far away, impossible to locate. Yet, magically, the bad guys show up. No explanation given. Problem number three: Later, something else major happens, very major, actually it's the climactic moment of the whole movie. It makes no sense, or only vague sense if you want to write some of the story yourself in your head to explain it, which is what I did. But the movie studio is not paying me, so why am I sitting there writing plot in my head to explain what's happening on the screen? Major major problem."", """", ""I want to see visual, audio hints, scenes, events that demonstrate to me what the heck went on. I don't want to just see a set piece, big action, and walk away saying OK whatever I guess there must have been something to explain that but they just didn't show it to us."", """", ""To recap, this movie has 3 major problems: (1) no psychological depth (i.e. the personal story of the couple and how that explained the main character's motivation); (2) the magical appearance of the bad guys at one point; and (3) the big finish set piece occurring without any explanation as to how. I can guess why, just guess, but have no idea how."", """", ""So rent it when it's cheap, and while you wait, read the book (which probably does not have the above problems) or 3/4 of it, saving the last bit to surprise you in the movie."", """", ""If they go back and shoot some more scenes, add 20 minutes to fill in those gaps and you could have a great movie.

I gave Infinitely Polar Bear a pass several times because I assumed it was a documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman. But it is not. Instead, it is a wonderful movie (having nothing to do with polar bears) that delves into the nuances of character more than any movie I have seen for the past few years. It likely will not get much attention because it does not focus on anything particularly politically correct, and most films that focus on realistic drama that get any attention are either about the plight of women or gay men or trans-this or that. This film focuses on a mentally ill man (not so crazy it makes you want to turn off the TV; just eccentric in a very realistic way that has a negative impact on those around him). If he turned out to be a monster I'm sure this film would have been nominated for something, but the writer/director stuck with honesty. This is simply an honest, warm and yet not saccharine in any way, rendering of the early life of the writer/director, who was raised by a bipolar father - a man entertaining on film since we don't actually have to live with him, though I'm sure it was not great fun in reality - with an Academy Award worth performance by Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana in one of her best roles yet.

Most immediately they blame a new American owned water works project (which is the very American business Own Wilson is there for). This all unfolds after Owen Wilson leaves his hotel to buy a newspaper. On the way back he sees protesters facing off against police, but the protesters are more than just protesters, they are well armed rebels; they overpower and kill the police and eventually swarm the hotel where Owen Wilson is staying with his family. He rushes in ahead of the rebels and the rest of the film is Owen and his family on the run, with a little help from Pierce Brosnan who adds a lot as a British agent.

Rey fared worse than Luke; she is paralyzed by Kylo Ren, rendered unconscious and captured. She accidentally causes the deaths of 8 characters, causes Han to lose his giant freighter ship, and is unable to prevent one friend from dying and another from going into a coma. If you go on a space adventure, you definitely do NOT want Rey watching your back! Also, you have to wonder how the haters can simultaneously believe Rey is a Mary Sue and that TFA is a remake of ANH, unless Luke was a Mary Sue!"", """", ""Regarding that final fight, complainers overlook that Kylo was twice injured before he started fighting Rey. First by Chewbacca. The movie took great pains to show how powerful Chewie's crossbow is. Recall when Han asked if he could use it? He blew a stormtrooper sky high then said, \""I like this thing.\"" That was to let you know later, when Kylo is struck by a bolt from the same weapon, of just how powerful a shot Kylo took. He was bleeding all over the ground before they started their duel. And he took another hit from Finn before Rey took over. The haters ignore this."", """", ""Rey's victory was not as impressive as Luke knocking out a stormtrooper, donning his uniform, shooting up a bunch of guards, rescuing Leia, and going from farm boy to the Rebellion's best pilot in 2 hours, destroying the death star - without his targeting computer! but using \""The Force\"" after a total of 5 minutes' of training from Obi Wan."", """", ""And how about Rey's partially successful attempt to resist Kylo's mind probe?

Why is she so strong with the Force? Heck she's the protagonist of a Star Wars trilogy, that's why! We'll find out her parentage next film. She's probably Obi Wan's granddaughter, since she and Obi Wan are the only two actors in Star Wars with English accents who play good guys. Why else would they make Finn speak with an American accent? Think about it."", """", ""Fact is, this movie is an improbable gift! 25 years ago, if anyone had told me one of the very best Star Wars films, in which Han Solo would figure prominently, would be released in 2015, I would have suggested they lay off the sauce. For me, One element that makes this film work so well is the instinctive empathy and compassion of Rey, it permeates everything she does even while she is at the same time as hard as nails, and the moral determination of Finn. Finn for all his bumbling machismo, is someone you admire for his unerring and moral compass. Even Solo, wizened by years, is driven to his own best moment by compassion. And it is all delivered in the context of a thrill ride of an action movie that never stops. There's nothing message-like about it. It is baked into the characters and drama. They all embody the light side by their actions more than Obi Wan ever did by talking about it."", """", ""Even though in trying to measure objectively I place this behind The Empire Strikes Back, I have actually enjoyed it personally more than any other Star Wars film - maybe because its very existence seems so improbable, maybe because it is heartening in late middle age to see Han Solo roughing up aliens and pirates in his mid-70s, maybe because Daisy Ridley is just such an excellent actress, or maybe because I know this is just the start and that there are at least 5 more films to come. It is like the Star Wars universe was dead and gone and has now been brought gloriously back to life. I've seen The Force Awakens twice. The first time in 2D. Second time in 3D. My recommendation. See it in 3D! There was one moment when the tip of a star destroyer hovering in space seemed to be about to bump my nose!"", """", ""Han Solo and Rey dominate. They carry TFA on their shoulders.

Henry Cavill is handsome but has zero personality in this, and that is a big big problem. The Russian guy is much better. I had thought the two would be competing for the woman's favor throughout to add a little fun pizzaz, but no. Cavill shows no interest; it's as if he knows he's too boring for her. The whole film is done in a manner that is very stiff and rigid. Nothing really flows organically. I've never before seen a movie that was bad in the peculiar way that this movie is bad. And of course like many films today, it was significantly too long given the amount of story it had to deliver. An hour and forty five minutes would have been plenty.

The surprise at the very very end was obvious several scenes earlier, but what can you do. And the complications that really would have occurred given the social circumstances as they were at the end of the movie are passed over in favor of a tidy conclusion. But that's Hollywood. One pleasure of this film was how well Harrison Ford looked and acted. He appeared younger than he has in some other recent movies. Sometimes he's brilliant, as in Indiana Jones. Sometimes he's very good as in Witness, and sometimes he falls totally flat as he did in What Lies Beneath or Expendables 3. Luckily here he does a great job. And the guy who portrays Ford's character as a young man was eerily spot on. The entire cast came across as comfortable with each other in a way that's rare in films.

This Bond flick is beautifully shot from start to finish (the love scene on the train, though brief, was a work of art); the best acting in any Bond film to date; the best character development of Bond in any Bond film to date (I know there are people who want Bond to remain a flat cardboard cutout comic book-like character; I'm not one of those people); a teaser among the very best of Bond teasers; arguably the best opening animation sequence (but the song is forgettable); the single best Bond story to date. But it is in a way a real drama as well as a Bond movie. Again, some people complain about this along with the (relative) realism of Craig's Bond, and the grittiness, but I love it. I'm not a child so I need a little bit of realism, at least emotional realism. I plan to head back to the theater to see it again, this time in iMax, which will make this the only Bond film I have ever traveled to a theater to see twice. For my money the two best Bond movies since Connery are Spectre and Casino Royale (Casino Royale had the most beautiful Bond girl in history, Caterina Murino) and the most specifically motivated villian. As for Skyfall, the writing ruined it. Comic bookish vaguely motivated bad guy; a radio homing transmitter as a Q gadget? Has Q not seen the iPhone?, and a Bond who didn't behave consistently with his character as established in Craig's first two films. No, for my money Casino Royale and Spectre are the best Craig Bond movies and the very best Bond movies since the 1960s. I would love to see Craig come back for more."" ]"

Unlike other period films that exaggerate the styles and attitudes of the 1970s, Blood Ties simply gets the 70s spot on correct. What a relief. The story is a complex interweaving of dramas involving a cop, his criminal brother, and the women in their lives. Those who think this movie are slow are looking for an action flick, which this is not. If you think Indiana Jones is a normally paced movie, then you might think this is slow. This is a drama that bothers to explore character, so that when the characters do things you know why. Rather than a series of nearly random set pieces as you get in crazy action flicks, here you get an actual story that is driven by the needs and desires of the characters who inhabit the movie. Imagine that. I think Zoe Saldana is the best actress in Hollywood and the sexiest to boot; it is a thrill to see her in something other than a super hero, action, or sci-fi flick. There is action in this of course. It's a violent film, but it is essentially a drama. Clive Owen, too, a great actor who doesn't get enough good roles. This film was a real treat.

The web slinging is filmed more frequently with stunt men and less frequently with CGI, and includes some first person camera scenes of those acrobatics, and so feels much more visceral and real. At one point you can even see as Spider-Man rises to the apex of his swing and before he descends again, the webbing go loose and then pull taught. It's that sort of realistic granular detail that gives this version more credibility than the others, which in turn makes every dramatic event hit with greater emotional punch.

It would seem completely out of place.

BUT in this film they've been together steadily for nine years and yet it doesn't feel that way. Yes there's the ex-wife and his son. But it didn't feel authentic. It felt put on. Either the writing didn't get at it well, or the acting didn't bring it across, or a little of both. I've been with my wife for one year, and I could make a gesture or utter a phrase that would have no meaning for anyone else, but she would know exactly what that phrase or gesture was about, and respond accordingly. There was none of that in this movie. Everything, including all the stuff going to the history of the past 9 years with this couple, was spelled out too much. When you do that the audience understands, but does not believe. You lose authenticity."", """", ""I've seen this done well in films. A gesture or suggestion or word, evokes a response that the audience does not comprehend in granular literal detail, but they get the KIND of thing that's going on. That he has struck a nerve going to some past indiscretion of hers. Or she has said a key word that brings on an old guilt trip he's had laid on him by her time and again. When it is not all spelled out in expository fashion, but we get the gist, that works better. It feels more real. The first two movies did not have to handle this issue because the couple had no history that we had not seen on screen. This one should have handled the issue, but it didn't. So my suspension of disbelief was not quite as complete. Granted this is a nitpicky detail, but it can mark the difference between a good movie or good actor, and great movie or great actor. This film fell squarely on the \""good\"" side of the fence, not the \""great\"" partly for this reason."", """", ""My other criticism goes to the sex. Yes sex. I have nothing against sex scenes normally. Angelina Jolie and Mr. Bandares in the DVD version (not the screen version) of that movie where she plays a mail order bride, naked and grinding explicitly on the bed while the camera watches from above? Go to it, I say! But this movie is very different and it did not work. The two are going to have a fight so, I imagine in order to make the fight seem like a bigger change and more dramatic, they put the two into a very cozy romantic situation just before the fight. And that situation involves Ethan sucking on Julie's breasts, her nipples. Not suggested or simulated but Mr. Hawke gets down and dirty right in front of your face, sucking, pulling, and basically giving any infant in the audience a tutorial on basic survival skills."", """", ""This failed to generate that cozy warm feeling of intimacy for me as a viewer. Instead it made me feel uncomfortable, as if I was getting TMI and was a third wheel in the room and should leave them alone. So I'm sitting their squirming and clearing my throat (hoping they'll notice I'm there and stop) rather than feeling the warm cozy intimacy they are feeling. I just kept thinking, these two actors are friends in real life, good friends but still, they are just friends. Which makes this sooooo awkward. And they're continuing to have their chatty chat while this is going on! Which almost makes it hilarious if it wasn't so weird!"", """", ""All of this said, I enjoyed the film. It's darker, much more so than than the previous two. It's also a slighter film where a more involved film was called for.

Big whoop. Not an ounce of Hollywood gloss here. The movie goes for realism in the extreme. Homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. It also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. No the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. Which was a breath of fresh air. But it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. For awhile there IS kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. But after that the film sprawls. Example. The dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you'll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. Maybe is considering getting back with her? But suddenly the movie cuts; it's years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. I don't know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it's just skipped.

Character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. Aside from the drama early on with the mom's domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. When Hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. I left this movie hungry for that cake. And besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. It's just that it's subtle. We didn't get that here."", """", ""There is no depth of the boy's life plumbed here. Just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related."", """", ""Another point. Aside from Ethan Hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. It's one thing not to be Disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. A story requires conflict.

You could switch out the dialog for all these guys. They are all the same. Except Ethan Hawke. Another unrealistic thing. When the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in a movie. This pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young George Clooney.

If they have values or principles or beliefs, that's skipped over too. There is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. Yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don't go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak.

Occasionally you hear someone say that having a likable protagonist is not important. They're wrong (and I suspect they are jerks who secretly identify with jerk protagonists).

I'm not against action; I enjoyed Spectre and Force Awakens and other superhero movies such as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 and the first Avengers movie, but there was nothing like the entertaining relationships of Avengers or Spider-Man in this film, and somehow the personal story (which revolved around Ant Man's desire to see his daughter, which his ex-wife wouldn't let him do because he hadn't paid child support which he had not been able to do because he'd just gotten out of prison) and its connection to the action wasn't convincing to me. It may have had to do with the lead not having adequate charisma or chemistry with anyone. It really just all came across to me as a bunch of noise. I think the musical score should have been a lot better too. It came across as generically bombastic. One bright spot was Michael Douglas, especially the way they made Michael Douglas in the first scene, which takes place in the past, appear so young.

Jurassic Park, the original, was graced with the quirkiness of Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern. No such quirkiness in Jurassic World. You've got a cookie cutter strong chinned ex-military guy who saves the day, and an attractive woman who of course does her share of saving him, even though it makes little sense given her profession because that is required by modern formula, and this is all formula. Neither of them have an ounce of anything that makes them stand out as individuals. They are generic. The best part of the movie is the big dino fight at the end. So wait until it's available to rent for $5 then watch it until you get bored, at which point you should fast forward to the final 20 minutes to watch the big finish dino fight. But really, these days, going to the movies, paying all that money, and taking 4 hours out of your day (which is what it requires when you consider the traveling to and from the theater and sitting through nearly a half hour of trailers), is just not worth it unless the film is amazing.

The pc complaints that she is somehow donning \""black face\"" because her skin was darkened and features altered for the role, is absurd. Black face is designed to mock black people. It's supposed to look fake. The efforts the filmmakers went to to make Zoe appear more like her subject is not unlike similar efforts implemented in any number of other films, such as some starring Daniel Day-Lewis. People who simply wanted an actress who was a carbon copy of what Nina Simone looked like on the outside without regard to acting ability or - and this is most critical - singing ability, are being frankly ridiculous, and those who cry racism should be ashamed of themselves. It would have been likely impossible to get anyone other than Zoe fit for this role in both singing and acting ability. To use Nina's own tracks would have been too fake and unnatural stuck into an actress's mouth like some old 50s musical. Zoe had the guts to go for this and luckily, incredibly, the voice to pull it off. If you have any interest in Zoe or Nina Simone you should watch this movie.

In the next few sentences I reveal minor plot basics, probably no more than professional reviews. A bad guy once again wants to destroy the Federation for vague reasons he cannot quite articulate - something about having been a soldier and now feeling useless because there is peace in the galaxy (it's news to me that there's peace in the Star Trek universe but whatever), and also feeling abandoned when he was left behind by people in Star Fleet a hundred years earlier (he's discovered the secret to some sort of life extension, you see, which was vaguely explained in five seconds). He has also changed his form completely, which is also unexplained but I suspect he did it by putting on an alien costume left over from the show Star Trek Enterprise, and he is going to take out as much of Starfleet as he can with a super weapon he can now use thanks to the fact that he has found some alien artifact he needs to make it work. You can't really give a spoiler because there's nothing to spoil. What I just told you is about the level of detail the movie gives. He sets this stone artifact in place like Indiana Jones, but instead of opening a door to treasure it powers up a weapon. No explanation as to why this weapon exists or its origins is even attempted. It's just some bs they threw together so they could trigger nonstop action which continues uninterrupted for almost the entire movie. Without room to breathe the movie just goes from one set piece to another, using closeups almost exclusively, so that often you don't know exactly where people are; and when they show one person running then cut to another, you don't know where those two are in relation to each other and if one is chasing the other and if so, which one; and when people are running through exploding ships I sometimes had no idea what was going on the visuals were such a busy mess. Whoever is in charge of maintaining the clarity of what is happening physically on screen utterly failed with this movie.

He apparently lost several pounds during filming. I'm sorry but I paid $12 to see Bruce Springsteen perform for 3 and half hours in 1978, an incredible classic performance. So if I'm going to pay over twice that much merely to see a 2 hour movie (3D iMax), then the script better be great, the visuals better be great, the acting better be great, and the actors better be fit and trim and look their best. If the actors can't get in shape for all the millions they are paid, then they have an entitlement problem. Zachary wasn't ready to shoot. Chris wasn't but he fixed it fast during filming. Zoe Saldana, who I love and think is beautiful, looks so severe throughout almost the entire movie (until the Kirk birthday scene when finally she looks like herself again) that she was unpleasant to watch. Mostly she just stared at things severely. They gave her little to do. Maybe she was still channeling Nina Simone and hadn't broken out of that character fully. The best of the regular cast this time around was Bones, who was great. Though there vulgar dialogue that was a bit jarring to hear in Star Trek, jokes about horse sh!t.

So what you get are two actors and an attractive woman lying naked on a table - with no attempts made at all to hide it; so the movie is full of the most unusual nudity you can think of- in the most unsexy circumstances possible. In most stories the characters engage in a lot of physical activity and move from one setting to another. It's a risk for a movie to limit itself to one setting and use only a couple of characters as this one does. There are more actors but their time in the movie is very limited. It's almost exclusively these two guys. If you think you can't deal with such a movie, don't watch this. But when I saw the trailer I was hooked. The young woman was found in a home where all the residents had been murdered. But she wasn't a resident. And she was found naked half buried in dirt in the basement; she was not killed while going about her business doing something normal in the house like the residents of the house were. As they do the autopsy they start to find weird stuff in her body, and the situation gets weirder from there. I would have given it more stars if not for a few big errors. Something very terrible happens, after which the father starts talking about the mistakes he made regarding his wife and how the son suffered due to that. This is fine to give the story some emotional depth, but it's the wrong moment. It doesn't work. What has just happened was too terrible. The father wouldn't have chosen that moment to say these things. They should have found a way to work it in before the terrible event. In fact, the way the two characters carry on after this event - within 10 minutes they're having conversation as if this event didn't happen - is totally unrealistic. Of course, the events of the movie are crazy due to the genre - but the way people react should be realistic. The ending is kind of cool but there's no reason it couldn't have happened earlier, much earlier, right at the start, in fact. And what the son does near the end - is also unbelievable. Also, one more problem, is that something that seemed to be happening, which seemed to be the ultimate point, did not happen; the ending would have been much better if it had. So I give the movie points for originality, but a couple of major missteps that could have been avoided if they'd just worked on the script some more, take it down to a 6."", ""But be warned, really scary."" ]"

The story is average, except that the latter portion skips over a number of years without explanation and tells us nothing of what happened in between.

Its rhetoric contained lessons in etiquette from a polite German bounty hunter, or Broomhilda (Brunhild) the naked viking, but lets actually suppose you have those submissive dimples and will lap this film up for what it is. There also were quite bad holes in its plot  purposefully because of that pie in your face. Lets suppose an apprentice sniper has night vision on his rifle. A bounty hunter kills a father in front of his son at long range effectively undoing the entire message of this film because a sketch artist has identified him without the visual aid of his freed man. After killing Candy would they let that man walk out of there to do it all again? I'm sure those six shooters needed that much blood flying in your face from them, making a cannon look bad. I.B had plots within plots, this however was 3 whole hours of the same thing repeated again and again. While missing much of the beauty of a western from it's locations.

There's a glimmer of promise when Brandon, on a date with his co-worker Marianne, asks her to feel a bump on the back of his head and explains, playfully, that he's a Neanderthal (and then goes on to describe the childhood mishap that actually produced the bump). It's worth noting that the exchange of dialogue in this scene is practically the only passage in the movie that doesn't feel oppressively contrived. A viewer who hasn't yet given up might suppose that Shame is finally pushing through to a recognition of Brandon as belonging to the wrong era: he has the misfortune to be the Neanderthal who survived the extinction of the culture's interest in sex addiction. All he's survived, though, in the constricted view that the movie is willing to allow itself, is a vaguely dysfunctional childhood in New Jersey. Curiously, the movie alludes ambiguously to a different (the same?) childhood in Ireland. The Irish childhood is another glimmer of promise; it suggests a whole other larger context, in which Brandon's struggles with himself derive from and are justified by a formative guilt-laden Irish Catholic upbringing (in Ireland, so much more guilt-laden than New Jersey can ever be). In this context, Brandon fits plausibly into the movie's frame because his origin is from outside the movie's setting. As a New Yorker with a sex addiction, he's an anachronism, but as an Irish immigrant, he's an outsider grappling with a plausible burden. But to make the Irish-immigrant narrative plausible, the movie would need to allow itself room to explore the larger context, and this is exactly what the movie rigorously declines to do."" ]"

Seriously, this was the hardest thing I've ever digest in terms of progressing my thoughts. It's so mesmerizing with so many things going on at once that it takes awhile to sink in. Gets you thinking on a subject that you wasn't originally interested in. A movie that leaves you completely paralyze of reacting or forming a sentence to describe what you just witness. But after four days of letting it sink in, it has been settled."", ""What I love about \""Silence\"" is that it doesn't judge-the potential arrogance & imperialism of missionary work. It doesn't make you pick aside to root for, but understand where both sides are coming from. It's up to you - the audience, to decide if their actions are right or wrong."", ""\""Silence\"" is easily one of best movies of 2016.

You see, Scorsese grow up Catholic and had desire to become a priest at a young age. So the book deeply moved him in a personal way.

While Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott will always be legends, but Marty doesn't just make a movie to stay relevant or just do it for the sake of it. You can see the passion behind every film his done. \""Silence\"" is no different. It's a deeply spiritual film and has multiple layers of meanings. Marty reminds us of that old cinema we love."", ""Andrew Garfield was absolutely fantastic in this movie. Garfield once again proves that he's a great actor. His performance was emotionally striking and he nailed the character down. It a real shame that he got nominated for \""Hacksaw Ridge\"" and not this. I thought he was far better in \""Silence\"".

Neeson doesn't have a big role, but his presence on the story is immense and unique."", ""All the Japanese cast were all stellar. Especially Issei Ogata and Yôsuke Kubozuka. Those two were the stand outs for me. Ogata character can be best describe as Christoph Waltz from \""Inglourious Basterds\"", as he's both comedic and menacing.

So when I was picking what movies I wanted to see at (LIFF), and this was on the list, as the festival also shows classic movies."", ""Re-watching this movie was quite the experience. Nothing like a massive screen and loud speakers blasting off beautiful music while drifting in space. From the dawn of man till the end of human life. The cycle repeats."", ""But seriously, what can I honestly say about \""2001\"" that hasn't been said already. It's one of the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time. It's groundbreaking and pure genius. Even at the slower pace parts, I was still engaged. After it was over, I was contemplating on it."", ""For a 1968 film, it's visual effects still hold up today and looks way more convincing than today. Well, there was a couple of effects that was noticeable, but the rest (which is mostly practical) still looks amazing. The \""Star Gate\"" sequence is one example of a trippy and a breathtaking effect that it owned Kubrick an Oscar."", ""Every shot in this movie is like something you would hang up on your wall. Kubrick has been known for being a perfectionist of his work. This is a work of an artist that doesn't just get praised for how much he dose, but how little. Three years of making this - you can get easily attached to your work that after awhile you find the hidden beauty of the story. Do it 40 or 127 times until you get what you want and exactly how you wanted. A similar method that Chaplin use for \""City Lights\"".

Just by those two images caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining \""Birdman\"" (A movie that I personal loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it."", """", ""Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, \""If we ended up in greenscreen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of **** And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed I've seen in 2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent."", """", ""I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call ''a silent performance'', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (Which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proven time and time again that he's more than the pretty face actor, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain, the tortured soul that Hugh Glass was and it's all through his face and eyes, and trust me when I say this but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic, as he played the man who lost everything and the tortured soul that Hugh was as a person was. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this."", """", ""Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (Or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but most of the time I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose."", """", ""I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home."", """", ""Now for the flaws and there's not that many for me: Some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me, and that's really it."", """", ""Overall The Revenant is one of most intense, stunning, brutal movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying, I mean how the hell did they do that?.

If today’s superheroes can’t help us through gun control, then this real-life hero of Hacksaw Ridge can."", ""Just the first opening sequence alone is enough to tear your heart open and make a home there. Images of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge show the brutality of the historical event: there are more corpses than living souls, rats have arrived to feast off the remains, blowtorches incinerate whoever is left alive, and the heavy-handed music reminds you of what each soldier had to leave to fight for the important things."", ""The story kicks off in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where one boy goes too far in a fist-fight with his brother, nearly killing him with a brick to the forehead. Reminded of the antiviolence account of Cain and Abel, Desmond Doss feels immediate remorse for what he committed against his brother, and vows never to get involved with violence again."", ""At a much older age, Desmond finds love with a local nurse who has seen soldiers return from World War II.

It seems here like director Mel Gibson is returning to his old bags of tricks with the romantic plot of Braveheart, but the vulnerable Church-boy accent by main actor Andrew Garfield wins over both men and women."", ""These small personal touches set up exactly why we should care about the tragic events that happen later, proving exactly what Gibson most succeeds at as a director. He’s not even afraid to put in some comic relief when it’s time for Desmond to join the army, where one of the first soldiers he meets is a narcissistic bodybuilder who loves exercising in the nude (except when it’s time for training). But once he opens up at Fort Jackson about being a pacifist, everything stops being funny. He won’t even tie a noose knot without it coming out shaped more like a heart. The rest of the army found it completely unthinkable that a soldier was enlisting with no ambition to even touch a gun, so what happens from here is a multitude of mixed emotions and unclear answers."", ""Hacksaw Ridge may seem at first like the typical war movie that resorts to the usual tropes, but experiencing the film proves how it does everything a gigantic leap further from the clichés.

While everyone else in this nation is concerned about unreliable self-righteous heroes like Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spider-Man, here is a hero who knows the importance of putting other lives ahead of his own, committing his service to unconditional love rather than destruction.

It’s hard enough living through one of the two, which is why it takes a seriously committed director like Barry Jenkins to accept the challenge. He doesn’t have that much experience directing feature-length films, but in Moonlight, you would think he’s been a master of his craft for decades. His latest feature has been picking up tremendous well-deserved Oscar buzz due to its subtle shock value that grips you throughout all the important milestones of a boy’s growth into a man within an all-Black community."", ""The boy’s name is Chiron, and Jenkins introduces us to him while he is on the run from other boys at school who throw garbage at him. His tears of fright call the attention of a humble, hospitable member of the community, played with a cool soothing voice by Mahershala Ali. In this stage of his youth, Chiron’s words are far and few in between, leaving room for what he doesn’t say, rather than what he does say, to craft his complex character. At this point he’s given the name “Little” by the friendly older man, who plans to help him get home, against the boy’s wishes, and for good reason. His mother is the living embodiment of the environment he must grow up in: trashed, rejected, dependent on drugs to sustain mental stability, in other words, the usual Black mother figure of Hollywood cinema. It’s not the best portrayal of Black women, but Naomie Harris’ (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Skyfall) performance as this mother figure is the most disturbing and terrifying onscreen depiction since Heath Ledger’s Joker."", ""This man quickly becomes the father figure “Little” never knew he wanted, as depicted by a nostalgic swimming lesson on the seashore. He may have the role model his mother failed to be, but it turns out that’s not what his biggest problem is. Rather, his sadness comes from daily getting called a **** so frequently in fact, that he wonders if it’s true. Under any other directors’ hands, this scene could easily go dreadfully wrong, but Jenkins knew how to pace it in a fashion that commands tears to be shed as Chiron opens up about his sexuality."", ""Then we are shown his teenage years, where he is given the nickname “Black” by his best friend Kevin. He almost always keeps to himself as his social capacity is limiting; his mother’s desperate harassment towards him for drug money not helping in the process. Just like anybody in their teenage years, here is where screenwriter (also Barry Jenkins) cranks up his storytelling vigor, throwing in detail after detail of Chiron’s most important memories to keep even the most distanced of minds intrigued."", ""The visual flavor is not like other motion pictures you have seen. Everything about the camerawork is flawed: the image jerks all over, the image spins in and out of focus, the white balance is off, but you know what? It works. If done unintentionally, this would appear to be the work of any amateur who’s never touched a camera before. But director of photography James Laxton orchestrates these imperfections to match the disorder of Chiron’s desire for self-discovery. Nicholas Brittel’s (The Big Short) soundtrack matches the troubling look of the picture to help you hate the people that Chiron would want dead."", ""While it may be an immediate shut-off for many to see the very open life of a homosexual, especially in a film that features only one White actor (playing a police officer), this is one of the most intriguing looks into Blackness of the past decade. It’s not every day you look into a world where all Blacks casually call each other a **** as if it’s common slang. So if the subject matter does not offend you, and you want to feel better about the place of Blackness in our world, then Jenkins’ character study is made especially for you."" ]"

The lonely, depressed, recently divorced plumber we are invited to connect with has a lot coming at him; having lost his brother to cardiac arrest, and now left to be the only one left to take in custody of his now fatherless nephew."", ""?"", ""From watching the heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the uncertainty of the plumber’s path, to the humbling, somber performance by Casey Affleck (no tears necessary), all audiences suited for the well-earned R-rating will be greatly moved by its rough depiction of an everyday story within an everyday life."", ""What makes the chilling power of this deceptively simple story so powerful is the consistently cold feel that Lonergan maintains from start to finish. Being set in the northeast, snow appears all over to reflect the plumber’s state of mind, and the cold is felt all the greater depending on the amount of stress tugging between him and his blood relatives. The screen’s empty starkness takes its time to linger on the quietest of moments, screaming the loudest of internal noises without saying a word."", ""Manchester by the Sea could have easily taken place anywhere in the world, not necessarily in one particular small town in one particular part of the nation. What makes the Boston-Manchester setting work to its advantage is its subtle handling of the culture, right down to the look, feel, and taste of the area. The much-needed emphasis on father and son bonding through the quietness of fishing bookends the film with the one single image that defines everything valued by the people who live there. Also similar to last year’s big Oscar-winner Spotlight, there is a clear presence of Catholicism guiding the lives of all Bostonians, whether or not they consider themselves religious.

Rey, Finn & Han are the major players and they all have a spectacular chemistry and surprisingly much humor. We experience wonderful development of both old as new individuals, and the acting performance of this diversity-friendly flick is five-star worthy! One character’s fate is a big event in this film. Some of you might find it like a smart move meanwhile others just find it like a bad one. I think it gave the film a brand new future.

The second time I saw this film though, made me look at Rey's and Kylo's flaws in a much less critical way. There're hints throughout the film that might give an inside to why they are as they are.

Tom Hardy is also highly skilled in this style of acting, making him an ideal choice for the taciturn and slightly deranged Max, and if one is being honest, he works better in this role when he doesn't have to speak at all. Nicholas Hoult is also outstanding as Nux, who is both the heart and humour of the film, and it is his character that has the strongest arc across the narrative."", """", ""It's deep ideas, interesting characters portrayed by skilled actors, presented in such an unusual and thoughtful way, combined with its exceptional visual presentation, make Fury Road a truly significant piece of film-making that takes its place among the truly great action films ever made."" ]"

Perhaps the main merit of the film is its clever script, which in addition to great fun, creates great dramatic scenes.

After watching Kubo, I sat stunned through the credits and spent two days analyzing every last detail of the picture. It was delicate, sublime, sad, triumphant, exciting.... put in another 200 adjectives and that should cover it.

Good Time is a gem of a movie and you'd do well not to miss it."", ""Over the course of one night Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson) tries to free his brother Nick Nikas (Benny Safdie) from prison. And thus mayhem ensues. Good Time sets itself apart from other heist/crime movies due to its extreme unpredictability and the intense grip it has on you from the moment it starts. The level of anxiety I felt during this film was incredible, and this wasn't helped by the stress inducing soundtrack. Original and very fitting, when the music is done right you really do notice it. Robert Pattinson was brilliant in Good Time and if I'm saying that then you know it's true. Gritty crime at its best, what more do I have to say to get you to see it? Highly recommended, this is honestly one of the best crime movies I've seen in recent years."" ]"

From the moment their relationship blossoms to the difficulties arising from their contrasting families you can’t help but become fully invested in this story. The chemistry between the two main characters is electric. Although it drags a little in the middle and I don’t know what they were thinking when they came up with the title I loved The Big Sick.

Planet of the Apes is a trilogy of prequels I never expected to love but with each and every movie the story gets better and better. The tone changes and now we’re here. The darkest of the three. War. And make no mistake this is very much a war movie throughout, the relationship between humans and apes beyond the breaking point. It’s violent, intense and complete with a powerful soundtrack. If you’re a fan of the previous movies then under no circumstance should you miss this. Andy Serkis has well and truly established himself as a master of motion capture. His performance is captivating, Caesar is up there with Gollum and King Kong. I could go on and on so somebody please just give the man an Oscar already.

The animation is beautiful, the interaction between the children feels so real you’re brought into this story immediately and you start to forget you’re watching a film.

Thankfully my fears melted away in this beautifully captivating story. Perfect chemistry, aesthetic set pieces and as for the music, well it's definitely one of the best movie soundtracks in recent years. Not necessarily the songs but the score itself is fabulous. Ryan Gosling looks better than he sings yet he sings better than I thought he would. The show stealer is without a doubt Emma Stone, giving an emotional and Oscar worthy performance. No my heart didn't break but I was lost in this wonderfully dreamy movie. Highly recommended."" ]"

As far as child actors go he was brilliant. The level of emotion in this one movie is incredible.

It echoes the vibes of other classic crime films, such as 'Taxi Driver', 'Dog Day Afternoon', etc, while at the same time maintaining a unique and imaginative look at a robbery gone wrong. Overall, my only minor objection is that the film is maybe even a little too fast-paced and free-flowing often times, but hey! After all, that is was made this film such a Good Time!"" ]"

The whole cast also made this a blast to watch, with the likes of Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer, Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, etc. each having their own great and fun moments in the film! The first half hour is all setup, with the last hour being a nonstop shootout in the vein of Tarantino, with hilarious quips-a-plenty from the characters throughout! Overall, this was without a doubt the funnest time I've had at the theater in recent memory, and I honestly believe that this film is destined to become quite the guilty pleasure of mine!

That being said, if you think that you're prepared to bring any of your children to this film, be prepared for some almost inevitable tearjerking to occur, because this film is as emotional and heavy as they come. Nonetheless, it's also such and extraordinary, beautifully-made film that will tug at the hearts of many as it certainly did mine and my family's. The cast does an exceptional job as well with Lewis MacDougall in the lead giving what I'd consider to be the best child performance of 2016. Felicity Jones, Sigourney Weaver, and of course Liam Neeson as the monster round out the excellent supporting cast. Overall, to reiterate, it's a beautifully-made film, but be prepared to get somewhat emotional, because I honestly can't imagine anyone with a heart not getting at least the slightest bit choked up by this film!"" ]"

The impressive cinematography is wonderful to watch and much of the imagery is quite impactful and memorable. As for the cast, Andrew Garfield delivers yet another brilliant performance after Hacksaw Ridge. Adam Driver and Liam Neeson in supporting turns also manage to make the film worthwhile. Overall, its length and heavy-handed faith-based message may prove as turn-offs and controversial for many. However, for those with the patience and fortitude to give it a shot, it's certainly not to be missed, especially for fans of Scorsese as he still proves that he's not quite out of touch with brilliant filmmaking just yet, even at his current age."" ]"

Mel Gibson has done what I considered to be the unthinkable: He's proved that he's still got what it takes to make a compelling and engaging film, even after all these years of his weird and controversial nature and personality, especially post-Passion of the Christ release. Anyhow, I digress. This was one solid and engaging war film from start to finish and quite possibly the most violent one I can recall since Saving Private Ryan. Nonetheless, it still manages to stand out rather well this way. As for the cast, Andrew Garfield gives what I'd heavily consider to be his greatest performance yet! Other familiar faces such as Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, etc round out the great and talented supporting cast in this film. Overall, despite a few moments of predictability throughout, they're more than made up for through the sheer power of the film's remarkable true story and hero along with the harrowing yet memorable war sequences in the film's second half. Simply put, it's just one solid film and a surprisingly pleasant return to form for director Mel Gibson!"" ]"

Hailee Steinfeld gives an irresistible, charming, and for me a relatable lead performance that is only surpassed by some scene-stealing moments from a very straightforward but nonetheless very funny and always reliable Woody Harrelson! Overall, I absolutely loved this film not only due to the charming and funny story that puts it in the same vein as some of the teen comedies from John Hughes, but also because I honestly felt as though I could relate to so much in this film as it really hit close to home with me and some of my personal experiences at that age. It made me quite nostalgic to return to that age to say the least. In addition, despite its occasional cliches that somewhat keep it from standing out too much from past coming-of-age and teen dramedy films, this is still quite honestly the best of the bunch as it's the best one I've seen in quite some time!"" ]"

Many times the film isn't too dialogue-heavy, but that isn't a problem as the characters in the film often times say so much without saying anything at all. The emount of emotional communication in the film is huge and really speaks volumes and went a long way for me. The actors brought each of their characters to life so well that they felt so real and I forgot that they were acting the whole time while watching the film. Needless to say that this is easily the best character study of the year as well. Director Barry Jenkins really knew what he was doing with this film. Huge props to him for handling the film and its characters and subject matter with so much maturity and love. Overall, my only minor note is that the film is told a little too straightforward and conventional sometimes, but other than that, this really was a near-perfectly crafted and executed film!"" ]"

However, the film's excellent character study, acting, humorous moments, gorgeous cinematography that captures rural Texas in all of its gritty glory, and smartly paced storyline elevates it to ultimately make for one solid western crime flick! As far as I'm concerned, it also serves as Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster's best and most compelling work yet! Overall, it's an absolute must-see for any western or crime fan or for those looking to see a more poised and intelligent film within these genres as opposed to a more all-out gunplay and action film. As far as neo-westerns go, I'm not exaggerating when I say that this one's on par with No Country For Old Men! It really is that great!"" ]"

It also had many surprises in store and took several unexpected turns and even had a surprisingly well-done character development, as it delves deeper into Captain America and Iron Man's personal conflicts! Admittedly, it did feel a little too cluttered and chaotic at times, but the film was able to remain fun for the most part for these reasons as well!

Despite this, I can't even begin to say how unprepared I was for just how weird this film got at times. However, on the contrary to what I've said so far, this didn't hinder my overall enjoyment of the film at all. The story and premise was unique and it's dark humor and dialogue was extremely deadpan and straightforward (more so than in any other film I've ever seen) and it was off-putting at times, but other times I have to admit it worked really well. Colin Farrell gives a great lead performance and the rest of the cast, such as Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, etc all had some worthwhile moments as well. Overall, this was undeniably bizarre, yet oddly enough it also proved to be the most unique and interesting film I've seen so far this year. However, like I said before it's also a very different film so please know what you're getting into before you pay to see this.

However, what I got from this film was definitely much more than I expected to get, and in a good way! The story, setting, atmosphere, etc was all so tense and mysterious from start to finish! Even the small, yet highly effective cast kept things plenty entertaining and interesting. Mary Elizabeth WInstead and John Gallagher Jr. both give solid performances, but holy hell brace yourself for John Goodman, who delivers such a menacing and chilling as hell performance, and undoubtedly his most memorable one in a long time! As for the story and its connection to Cloverfield, without giving anything away, the final twenty minutes or so should be enough to satisfy those who were dying to know if it ties in with that film in any way, but it's also effective in the sense that it can make the film stand out on its own really well too.

Regardless of what anyone else thinks of this film, I absolutely loved it! It brings together an absolute top-notch cast, all of which give equally memorable performances! Dare I say that this just may be Sir Michael Caine's best performance of his career! Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, and Paul Dano all deliver grand performances alongside him. Jane Fonda proved to be quite the scene-stealer in her brief, but powerful five-minute scene! As for the rest of the film, what can I say!? Everything about it was breathtaking and beautiful in one way or another! The cinematography, along with the many dazzling slow-motion shots are a feast for the eyes! The score also really stood out to me, especially in the film's final act! Also, the many messages that the film delivered through its though-provoking dialogue and symbolism had me pondering and marvelling the film long after I left the theater!

The script was clearly very well thought out, as the dialogue was crisp and engaging! Among many of these great aspects of the film, the best was easily the film's ensemble! It served as a great showcase for everyone involved, most notably Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo who both deserve supporting actor nominations at the Academy awards this year!

One visually stunning and intense scene involving a plane in particular left my mouth agape!

The story was intriguing, well-written, and often kept me fixated and wondering what was going to happen next. Overall, despite kind of a slow pace towards the beginning, the film quickly picks up and doesn't let go until its final moments. It's also another great and notable achievement from director Denis Villeneuve and his best work since Prisoners!"" ]"

Everything about it is just so perfect! From the gorgeous animation to the lively and very funny voice cast! Amy Poehler is perfectly delightful as Joy! Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, and Mindy Kaling as Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust respectively were all perfectly cast as well. The overall story is also highly imaginative, unique, and completely entertaining from start to finish!

Overall, not only is this easily the best summer kickoff film so far this year, but it's also without a doubt one of the most exciting and impressive films I've seen so far this year! George Miller brilliantly outdoes himself with this more than welcome return to Max's post-apocalyptic world we've come to know and love! What a lovely day indeed!

It's definitely one of his lighter-feeling films compared to some of his previous works, such as Magnolia and There Will be Blood. The film had a lot to offer. It was surprisingly funny on several occasions and didn't take itself too seriously. The whole entire ensemble cast also manages to put on a grand show. Joaquin Phoenix made for a great and funny lead. Josh Brolin also had several funny moments. Overall, it's definitely another great addition to PTA's directorial filmography and one of the best films late 2014 had to offer!"" ]"

However, the film's premise intrigued me so much that I decided to read the book a couple weeks prior to seeing this. And after watching this film, I'm very glad I read the book first, since the film remained extremely faithful to it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike each give without a doubt career-best performances! The film sets the same ominous and mysterious tone the book created so well. And of course, David Fincher's brilliant directing also made this film amazing. I was fully intrigued from start to finish, just like I have been with every one of Fincher's films. Aside from what I felt to be a slightly underwhelming ending compared to how the book ended it, I couldn't recommend this film any higher! Definitely check it out if you loved the book or are a fan of David Fincher."" ]"

Chris Evans gives a strong lead performance. Tilda Swinton finds herself in yet another strict and intimidating role. The rest of the supporting cast, such as Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Octavia Spencer, Ed Harris, etc also did really well. Overall, it's one of the best sci-fi films this year and one of my favorite films of the year thus far!"" ]"

With this being his biggest film yet, a huge all-star cast guides the film along rather smoothly. Ralph Fiennes is delightfully funny in the lead role of the film. Obviously there's way too many other cast members for me to go over so I'll just keep it short by saying that everyone does a marvelous job in the film. There are no wasted actors or appearances in the film. Everyone served a purpose in one way or another. Despite a somewhat anticlimactic final act, it's still yet another solid addition to Wes Anderson's great line of films. Fans of His previous work will almost certainly love it. Non-fans might still appreciate it for its zaniness and the great cast. Overall, definitely worth a view."" ]"
american-hustle;9;1;moviemitch96;"[ ""Not perfect, like many critics have been claiming it to be. However, it is most certainly yet another great addition to director David O. Russell's line of films. The story and pacing felt a little stuck at times. But really, it's the acting and the intriguing cast that makes this movie great! Christian Bale puts on a few pounds as the unpredictable con man, Irving. Bradley Cooper's performance as a crooked FBI agent served as one of the more memorable male performances in the film. Amy Adams is daring as Bale's love interest. Jeremy Renner gives a worthwhile goody two-shoes performance as the mayor. And last, but absolutely not least, Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all in what may well be her fiercest performance yet. The plot was also intelligent and well done for the most part, but like I said, it's really the characters that make this movie. David O. Russell even said it himself that he likes to focus on and prioritize characters more than plot. In this film's case, it fortunately worked. So overall, if you're a fan of David O. Russell's previous films (or films with interesting characters,) there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy this, because this may be one of his best films yet."" ]"
dallas-buyers-club;9;1;moviemitch96;"[ ""I never thought I'd say this, but Matthew McConaughey actually has talent! This film was the one that finally proved that to me! In this film, he portrays Ron Woodruff, a bull rider and electrician who tests positively for HIV. The film is loosely based on the true story of his buyers club that he starts for several other HIV patients with the use of illegal drugs. The film boasts a solid and talented cast. McConaughey gives what is, in my opinion, his best performance yet by far! Jennifer Garner also gives an honest performance as a headstrong doctor. Jared Leto returns to the big screen after his four-year absence from filmmaking as a transvestite named Rayon. His performance, along with McConaughey's is what really propels the film's conflict. Overall, the pacing is slow in some spots, but manages all the while to remain entertaining, thanks to the Oscarworthy performances from McConaughey and Leto. Definitely check this one out for an interesting take on a great true story!"" ]"
the-wolf-of-wall-street;10;2;moviemitch96;"[ ""This film left me speechless (in a good way) once the credits rolled. What I saw was, without a doubt, the craziest film Martin Scorsese has ever made! And it was amazing to say the least! The over-the-top sex, drugs, and language play out humorously, which is different for Scorsese, as he usually aims for dramatic when it comes to those sorts of things. Nevertheless, it works perfectly! The story of Jordan Belfort transitions from comedic and crazy in the first half to dramatic and serious in the second! Both aspects worked perfectly in detailing his crazy, messed up life. DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is flawless and should go down as his best performance in his entire career! Jonah Hill was often times hilarious and made for a great comic relief in the more dramatic and serious parts of the film. Matthew McConaughey was very thought-provoking and funny in his small role at the beginning. All of the other supporting cast members did great and helped this film run along smoothly. But overall, in its lengthy 3-hour runtime, Scorsese creates what is (in my opinion) his absolute best film to date (and yes, even better than Goodfellas!) This film is an absolute must-see for any and all Scorsese fans, as well as any movie-goers looking to see one of the best films of the year!"" ]"

I ended up loving this movie and leaving the theater with a huge smile on my face! The cast worked really well with each other. Jason Bateman gave a really confident performance. Tina Fey also did surprisingly well. Adam Driver and Corey Stoll were both really funny. And Jane Fonda also gave a worthwhile performance. Judging from what was shown in the trailers, it may appear as just another dramedy. However, this one had one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen in a dramedy and I really felt a lot of emotions while watching this! Overall, it's a very funny, touching, and underrated film that I highly recommend.!"" ]"

I related to a lot of things in this film, since I also grew up during the 12-year time frame that it took place. I highly commend Richard Linklater for coming up with such a simple, yet daring idea of a boy and his family growing older over the course of 12 years. While the film doesn't necessarily have any Oscar-worthy performances, everyone does so well with how long it took to make the film. Ellar Coltrane is fun to watch as he grows older and the many different events that unfold around him throughout his life. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette give great and honest performances as his parents. The only weak performance was from Linklater's own daughter Lorelei. Overall, there were a few things in the film that I wish would've been done a little bit differently. For the most part however, it's easily the most heartfelt, honest, and genuine-feeling film I've seen all year so far. As far as I'm concerned, it might as well be considered the quintessential coming-of-age film!"" ]"

All of the film's elements come together marvelously, from the great acting and often times emotional story to the dazzling effects, images, and music! Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful and moving performance in the lead. There were also some great supporting performances from Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, etc. Hans Zimmer, who composed most of Nolan's previous films once again composes an epic and unforgettable score for this one as well. And of course, the effects are simply gorgeous, need I say more?! Despite the lengthy three-hour runtime, I didn't mind it a bit this time around, as the film kept me completely engaged from start to finish! Overall in my opinion, it's Nolan's absolute best film since The Dark Knight and is without a doubt the greatest film I've seen all year and I'd love to see if any other film this year can top this one for me, but I highly doubt it!"" ]"

However, to my surprise it turned out to be a really fun movie in the same light and humor as The Avengers. Great action and effects throughout. Chris Pratt is really funny and great to watch as Starlord, Zoe Saldana also does really well. However, the two people who steal the show are Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper who voice Groot and Rocket respectively. Overall, this film is all around great and just plain entertaining from start to finish. And just like any other Marvel film, stick around for a post-credits scene."" ]"

It harbors a slightly darker tone, but still has plenty of great comic relief moments and one-liners just as the first film did, as well as the same great mind-numbing action! There were a few things that disappointed me. I heard nothing but great things about James Spader's Ultron. However, unfortunately I found him to be a somewhat underwhelming villain for the most part. I also thought that the romance between Bruce Banner and Black Widow felt randomly placed, pointless, and unnecessary. Other than that, this was still a great and overall entertaining sequel!"" ]"

Michael Fassbender's a great actor and I always love his performances, but I honestly couldn't picture him taking on the role of Steve Jobs at first. However, I'm more than happy to say that he gives a performance that's without a doubt worthy of an Oscar nomination! Seth Rogen and Kate Winslet also gave memorable supporting turns and I really think they deserve Oscar nods for this as well. Sorkin's screenplay flows very smoothly with some great dialogue and back and forth exchanges between characters throughout. And Boyle's direction is as confident as ever.

room-2015;10;2;moviemitch96;"[ ""Easily one of the most hauntingly and emotionally powerful films I've seen all year! Despite not being a completely faithful adaptation to the just as powerful book on which it was based, author Emma Donoghue successfully delivers a more than satisfying adaptation for the film that leaves all of the most important and essential things intact, but also even improves upon certain moments in the book! As for the acting, words simply can't describe Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances! I can honestly say right now that there's no justice on this earth if Larson doesn't win the best actress Academy Award this year! The amount of emotional and heartbreaking heft she gives in her performance is amazing and undoubtedly the high point of her career to date! Tremblay is also very much worthy of at least a nomination, as he gives what I can only describe as the best child performance I've ever seen! He's the rare instance of a child actor that never felt annoying or irritating in the slightest and truly poured his heart and soul into his performance just as much as Larson's. The film also managed to get me choked up quite a few times and by the end it made me realize just how much damage and suffering can be done to a person and last, even when the worst of a situation is over, but at the same time, it also made me realize how strong we can all be deep down in our ability to overcome even the worst as long as we have family or someone there for us. Overall, it's without a doubt the most hard to watch, heartbreaking, but also most beautiful film I've seen all year! It's a film that truly humbled me and is a shining and welcome reminder that the human spirit and will is indeed alive and well!"" ]"

Overall, Deadpool fans will almost certainly not be disappointed, while even casual fans and film-goers are likely to have a blast with this film!

The song and dance numbers were all an absolute joy to watch and did such a wonderful job of paying homage to many golden age musicals and classic cinema! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have never been better and were perfectly in tune with each other! The story and message is universal and was one I certainly felt that I could relate to and many others as well I'm sure, because if there's any movie that you need to lift your spirits and remind you to always follow your dreams, this is the one to turn to without a doubt! Just when I thought that director Damien Chazelle couldn't possibly outdo himself after 2014's also brilliant \""Whiplash\"", man was I in for a pleasant and more than welcome reality check with this film! Overall, it's a film that made me laugh, smile, and even just about cry tears of joy from start to finish! Why can't more films be as beautiful and joyful as this!? Then again, that's what'll help this film stand out all the more and make it remain not just as an even more unique and special film, but also an even more unique and special experience for years and years to come!"" ]"

The Academy might as well just give Casey Affleck the best actor Oscar right now, because as far as I can tell, no one else this year will likely come anywhere close to his compelling and moving performance that I'd easily rate as his best yet! Michelle Williams and her few brief but worthwhile and hearfelt appearances throughout also served the film well. Sophomore actor Lucas Hedges also delivers a memorable breakthrough performance as well. In addition, the whole film form start to finish had just the right blend of subtle charming and lighthearted moments to support its poignant dramatic story. Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan's screenplay might just be among my favorites this year with its straightforward yet often times quite impactful dialogue spoken from the characters in the film.

the-revenant-2015;9;1;moviemitch96;"[ ""I had the chance to read Michael Punke's novel that this was based on before seeing this. So when watching the film, I noticed that it was straying awfully far away from what was happening in the book and at first I was disappointed. However, by the time the film ended, I understood more why this was the case. First off, the credits read \""based in part on the novel by Michael Punke\"", so that was a dead giveaway right there. Also, Punke couldn't promote, do any publicity, or even be on set or aid in the making of the film due to the fact that he's currently an ambassador to the World Trade Organization, which prevented him from helping the filmmakers include many of the events from the novel. I also realized that since so little is known about what happened with the real-life Hugh Glass that multiple stories and plot points can be made up about him. Even Punke admitted to having to make up several events that were in the novel. So basically Punke was telling his own version of what Glass might've been through or experienced, while the filmmakers were telling their own as well. For these reasons, I'm able to forgive the fact that the film drastically strayed from the novel. In fact, the more I thought about it after the film ended, the more I realized that I actually liked the film better, because the third act in the novel kind of strayed from the revenge plot that it so specifically advertised and went more towards the justice route, whereas the film stuck firmly with the revenge plot, which made for a much more exciting and satisfying third act that truly made the film a great story of revenge! In addition to this, everything about this film was absolutely perfect and phenomenal! The gorgeous cinematography and landscape shots throughout, the hauntingly effective and powerful score, the brutal and unflinching violence and action, etc. And of course, the acting from everyone involved was outstanding! Leonardo DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar for this film, mark my words!!! Tom Hardy also delivers a very aggressive performance. Even Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter make the most of their characters and screentime. So overall, director Alejandro G. Inarritu does it again with a film that's just as intriguing and engaging as his last film Birdman was! It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive, powerful and memorable films of 2015!"" ]"

Maybe they didn't bother actually writing a review because they are small minded racists, xenophobes or bigots.  Either way, their ratings make no sense.  This movie is funny, touching and sweet, with terrific performances and a great heart.  Kumail Nanjiani is terrific playing himself in this autobiographical romantic comedy.  Zoe Kazan is charming and perfectly believable as Emily.  Their relationship, and its ebbs and flows, feels genuine.  Holly Hunter is wonderful as Emily's mother.  You forget how good she can be in the right part.  She is a real joy to watch in this film.  Hunter sort of carries the middle of the film.  Ray Romano is fine as Emily's father, though the role is rather thankless.  Hunter's Beth is the critical parent here.  Kumail's family is played well and they are perfectly annoying and seeped in their traditions.  Kumail has to deal with racist bigots and a family who wants him to stay within their culture, even though they've transplanted to Chicago from Pakistan.  This movie has many laughs and a few tears.  The movie has an independent film feel and is bogged down with typical corporate Hollywood conventions.  It is well worth watching and I truly enjoyed it.  The 5.5 rating right now is a joke."" ]"

Any intelligent person who sees this movie could not give it a 0.  I must admit that I knew who James Baldwin was before this film, but I had not read anything more than a short essay of his in college.  I was completely blown away by his intelligence, his insight and his verbal acuity in numerous old television appearances.  It is so sad that there are so many people in this country who hate people because they are black or because they are white or because they are gay or because they have the audacity to challenge existing societal norms.  One of the most amazing things about Baldwin that I got from this film is that he, unlike other outspoken civil rights leaders of the 1960s, is that he didn't hate white people.  He just saw what was so obvious to him then, and is obvious to me now, that there are many ignorant people who hate other people based on their skin color, ethnicity or religion.  This film was so powerful to me that I watched another documentary about him the next day and I am now reading Baldwin.  If you have an open mind and want to learn about a great writer and communicator then this is a movie you will adore.  But posting a 0 review for a movie you did not see is just ignorant."" ]"

Now, with the most recent new events, even my wife thinks Anthony Weiner is a dirtbag.  I actually agree with his politics.  But his personal behavior is so reprehensible that I am disgusted.  The way this film shows him using his child on election day as a prop and subjecting that poor child to the media circus created by Poppa Weiner's sexual addictions is simply disgusting.  This film shows Weiner's gigantic ego and utter lack of moral fiber.  While he did not do anything criminal, this film shows him to be the piece of trash he is.  Thank goodness Huma finally had enough of him."" ]"

But there are many stupid movies too.  Spotlight is an intelligent, thoughtful and important movie.  The cast is great.  Mark Ruffalo, who I usually do not like, was more of a distinct character than he has ever been in a film.  There is tension and a great payoff.  The only movie I have ever seen like this is All the President's Men.  Granted, that had the whole government aspect, but the Catholic Church, especially in Boston, is a quasi government.  Spotlight makes one sad that real investigative journalism is on the decline in this country, due to all of the corporate mergers of newspapers and their goals.  But it highlights an important and unique role the media can, and truly should, play in our society."" ]"

But they are all well acted and are very funny at times.  Having an understanding of how the market works and is manipulated makes this film much easier to understand.  My wife, who is an attorney and is very intelligent, doesn't have the economics background to understand all of what was going on.  So having an understanding of the gambling that the stock market has become is very helpful is appreciating this film and The Big Short is a very fun little romp - definitely one of the best movies of the year."" ]"

A young British kid left in Northern Ireland, in a conflict he has no interest in, with a hostile group of locals.  The movie builds its own intensity and drive. The background or makeup of the side characters does not matter.  It is simply enemies versus friendlies.  The movie develops an amazing momentum and drive that leads us to the not-totally-satisfactory conclusion, that resembles early 70s films.  Loved this film."" ]"

This movie is beautiful and well shot, using modern techniques and cinematography to replicate old style silent movies.  It is true that one needs more of an attention span to appreciate a movie like this.  It is also valid to suggest that much of the plot is nothing groundbreakingly new.

moonrise-kingdom;9;1;StevieGJD;"[ ""Quirky, well acted, and amusing.  Wes Anderson's films are not for the masses, as they are subtle and, quite frankly, more intelligent than the fodder we are fed by corporate Hollywood.  I imagine his movies don't cost that much to make, that the actors all work for much less because they like him, and that because of these financial assets, make enough money to let him make the next one.  I have liked them all to one extent or another.  That's how it is with his films.  If you don't like the quirky pathos infused humor, you just won't like his movies.  He has his own voice and clearly his own aesthetic vision.  I loved it."" ]"

Awesome special effects, though this does not have to be seen in 3D.  It's fine without 3D.  If you like comics or action movies, you will like this.  Not every popular movie is bad."" ]"

I also understand that some will be turned off by the prolific use of torture in the film.  Those scenes are disturbing and meant to be.  But anyone who doesn't think this film is honest in what it is portraying is either overly partisan or just not honest with themselves.  Even though we all know the end, the movie develops a tension towards that end which is palpable.  Chastain is wonderful in the lead role.  It shares the same gritty cinematography as the Hurt Locker, but for me, it was a more interesting story, perhaps because so much of it is behind the scenes."" ]"

You will not like it and will reject any truth in it. Moreover, it will fuel a plethora of ignorant observations that would be better left unobserved. I did not grow up in such a place. But my wife did. Though this, like every movie, cannot include every type of person who grows up in such an area, there have not been many movies about a smart young black kid who lives in a ghetto, and who understands that education is a better ticket out than sports or crime. This should be celebrated not dismissed. Though I'm not a huge John Hughes fan, this film is reminiscent of Hughes' films. I look forward to the director's next outing.  The film has many cultural and music references that some people will not understand, and might cause them to dismiss the film.  I know I did not get them all.  But I got enough that I laughed plenty of times and was pleasantly shocked a few times.  People who don't like profanity, intense sexual situations and drug references will not be pleased either.

The use of concert footage, personal videos, prior broadcast interviews and intimate audio interviews with many of the people closest to Amy Winehouse leads to an understanding of what happened to this extremely talented and troubled young woman.  The director also cleverly uses Winehouse's own lyrics as essentially her autobiography.

Without discussing plot, this film is really about an action that yields such terrible and life altering results that a person can never come back from the consequences.  This could have been more of a pity party than it is, where there sort of a nobility in suffering.  It is not a movie for everybody.

avatar;10;1;Eliasc;"[ ""The major reason I dislike 3D movies and avoid them is that directors think that the audience needs to have stuff thrust out of the screen at them. Sorry Hollywood, but I am older than twelve and am not impressed by such bad filmmaking technique. The intent of a film should be to entice the viewer to believe in the characters, the story and the world presented on the screen; to be drawn into images and imagination you have created so that we, the audience, believe it. No 3D movie has yet accomplished this ... until now. James Cameron's Avatar is 3D done right. It draws the viewer into the forest world of Pandora making it utterly believable. The few 'thrust something into my face moments' are appropriate and not intrusive. If this is the future of 3D film-making then I can see that it truly has a future. Aside from the 3D, the film also stands out as a well constructed story and superb world building. The film borrows elements from historical and SF sources including James Cameron's own 'Aliens' movie, the SF sub-genre of alien culture stories exemplified by authors such as C. J. Cherryh, and the film 'Dances With Wolves'. James Cameron has once again raised the bar for future filmmakers. We shall see the results over the next few years.

Either they just keep chasing whatever it is they've lost, or they keep dreaming beyond their reach.?"", ""You can't doubt Hiroshi Abe's presence. He was perfect along with Kirin Kiki, whose a few films I've seen before, but only started to notice recently with her amazing performance from 'Sweet Bean'. The casting looked great, and the locations. I always like films about elderly people, especially to highlight their struggle. And most of the Japanese films I have seen on that concept were just like the way I wanted. Maybe because there are lots of aging people in Japan than anywhere else. Just kidding."", ""Obviously dialogues are very important for a film and there were many good lines spoken. At one point in the final stage, it flips towards sentiments. Very touching conversation, particularly coming from an old and experienced woman, which is definitely worth taking heed. This is a family film. Despite about a marriage crisis, there is no speculation, like twist and turns. Interesting enough with its plain narration. True to its title and when the title part comes into play, that's where it gets its peak. With its nearly two hours runtime, the pace was acceptable, but patience needed for those got trouble with long films."", ""This is the film about our life, that we can try for what we want to be, but achieving it not easy, not everybody would succeed that. Accepting the fact, as life my go on was the message. Incredible writing and direction. Feels like straight out of a book, it's an original screenplay though. Surely you don't want to miss this film, from this director. Because if you do, it is equal to failing to watch the latest Woody Allen film. Only he's a Japanese version. My final words are the director already made his masterpiece(s), but still it is near to one compared to the international cinemas. So I'm not saying it is a must, but surely worth a try."", ""7.5/10"" ]"
frantz;8;1;LeZee;"[ ""What is the most painful, the war or the lies?"", ""This is pleasantly a surprise film. I would say it is this year's the Oscar winning film 'Ida'. Frankly, there's nothing to compare between two. Not just both of them are modern black and white film, but they are quite similar in the portrayal of lead female characters. Just like 'Marie's Story', it was also inspired by another Hollywood film, 'Broken Lullaby'. I haven't seen that. Even not many people have seen it. One of the less known classic drama which I am going to give a try now. Coming back to the film, it was about the World War I that centres on a young woman who lost her fiancé."", ""Nearly two hours drama, quite slowly narrated, but I never felt drag in storytelling or boring to follow it. From the director of 'In the House', yet another masterpiece. Yeah, it looked like that way for me. Only a very few characters and they all developed so well, almost till the end when a few more joined them. The title role was appeared for like only 4-5 minutes in the entire film. Well, that was the topic, a reason for this story to begin along with the WWI. Though the following storyline was built on a different platform."", ""Like there is a saying 'to hide one lie, a thousand lies are needed', that's what this film was actually about. Living and keep on evolving in the endless process. It is a moral, a message film, but the mistake was committed by someone else that another person has to take the fall for it, even after he goes out of the picture. Really a touching story, but not a tearjerker. The journey of life is sometimes unexpected, particularly when it comes to romance that blooms when one needed it last at the circumstance he's at his life."", ""?What would the truth bring? More pain, more tears.?"", ""This is not a war film, just in case if you are expecting one. It was a subject under everything happen. So, there's only less than 5 minute clips of them in the film. Basically, those clips too were not required, but it's always nice to see them in pictures when a flashback come into play. It is a pure drama that sets in just after the end of the WWI. A young German woman is mourning for the death of her fiancé. She discovers a young French man who claims his close friend came to condole his demise. He meets the rest of the family and shares those happy days he spent with him in Paris before the war. During his stay, they all get along quite well, despite the people from society are against it/him."", ""That was the first half of the film, developed slowly and steadily, but ended with a twist. The following half began on the new direction with lots of mysteries surrounding. Completely unpredictable, yet as a viewer, I had hundred of different thoughts about the upcoming developments. I was somewhat right on most of the occasion, but I was even happier about how it all went on its own style. Now the story entered the France. More twist and turns unfolded. The pace of the story looked the same, though lots of developments made it look advanced very fast."", ""The World War II is the most dominated theme in the war films. When you see a film on WWI, you will come to realise its perspective, if the film was made with the right dose of everything, even if it was not based on the real event or the person. Fighting the war, carrying the wound, grieving for the lost ones, struggling to rebuild the life and the nation. This is definitely one of the best WWI related, I mean about the aftermath of the war films I've seen. The screenplay was magic. I would surely give an award for it. And then the beautiful photography. I don't know it was because of the black and white, but virtually you would be taken back to the 1919. Simple, yet a great camera angles that must be appreciated."", ""Wonderful cast. Without those amazing performances, this film would have been nothing. Anna is the name you would remember for very long and the actress who played it. In a couple places, the screenplay turns semi colour, particularly when musics takes the front stage. Just in case if you are yet to watch, pay attention to that, because not everybody notices that. To me it looks like an Oscar product, but the release date confirms not eligible for the next Oscars. Different people have different opinion, but I think it is a must see. Those who struggle with slow paced narration, if they manage the opening half, then they would enjoy the remaining and love the overall film. Definitely a hidden gem, it just needs more audience, that's all."", ""8.5/10"" ]"
land-of-mine;8;1;LeZee;"[ ""Teen POWs in the post WWII Denmark."", ""A Danish war-drama that was inspired by the historical account, but all the characters were fictional. Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to the west coast of the USA to compete at the 89th Academy Awards in the coming February. I have seen many foreign films, but I'm not this much positive for any others. If this film fails to make, then that would be a great disappointment despite having no idea of what are the other four films. So this is just for now, my stance may change later."", ""Anyway, the film was heartbreakingly amazing. The WWII stories I had seen those told from the perspectives of the Australian, Japanese, Korean, Russian to African and European to the American western sea, Hawaii. And this is a Danish story, sets in just after the end of the war where prisoners of the war were used to clean up the mess. In the opening the teen German POWs were trained to defuse the land mine explosives and then later the unit was handed over to the Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen where they are all going to work in one of the west coast landmines that was used to defend the Scandinavia by the Nazi. That is the story told how it all ends in the remaining parts."", ""This was like another 'Kajaki', but not actually a war film. Using of the prisoners as the labourers is a violation, according to the Geneva rule. That's the point of the film, focused to reveal the inhume act. But it was not anything like 'The Railway Man' 'Unbroken' or the 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Watching a film about the brave soldiers inspires us and bring patriotism, but in this those teen kid screaming whenever something goes wrong really brings heartache. So not everybody feels comfortable with it, especially the family audience. But there were lots of edgy moments and you would never know what events follows."", ""\""If they are old enough to go to war, they are old enough to clean up.\"""", ""It was shot is the real location, and I think that part contributed to depicting the actual atmosphere where most of the POWs lost their arms and legs and some exploded into many pieces in the air. It was a simple narration, but the visuals talked itself more than anything else. All the actors were outstanding, especially those 4-5 German teens and of course the Danish sergeant Carl. I think the Carl's influence had more impact, after seeing the opening scene where he went outrage and beat up those German soldiers returning home."", ""There are a couple of small twists, but there are some scenes which are not easy to get over. Even though we know those were just fake, but that does not work once you totally into the story deeply. This is a different kind of emotional film, something you rarely experience. The director who is also the writer must be appreciated for handling it perfectly. Especially keeping the screenplay uncomplicated and between the two nations, where in the real event involves the British officials. I have never seen his other films, but this one will define him forth and the people are going to recognise him. So I hope he'll keep up doing such level films in the future."", ""I have never seen such film, I mean seen some where the kids were tortured, but this was very unique and totally a different perspective for that takes place in the backdrop of the WWII. Especially the Germans perspective is the very rare kind. So I'm kind of thinking if Germany picks 'Look Who's Back' for the Oscars, the contest between these two would bring two different moods. At this point I don't remember any Danish film I have seen so far in my life other than this one which I feel is the best Danish film ever. I mean, come on, who would do such film where your own nation, if not the whole nation, the one who represent was shown in the negative shade over the Nazi Germans. This is definitely one of the best films of the year. Highly recommended."", ""8/10"" ]"
a-united-kingdom;8;1;LeZee;"[ ""The story of two kingdoms."", ""It got the mixed responses from all the quarters, but I had a little doubt that did I watched the same film! Because it was much better than what I have had heard from them. It's a biographical romance- drama from the director of 'Belle'. And like the inspiring life stories of Gandhi, Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. et cetera, this one falls in the same line. All of their life events set in different kind of geopolitical scenario, so do this man's. But it was like differences in the family, which led to geopolitics. Anyway, the history book says, all the great struggles began with some game changing incidents like in this story."", ""Seretse Khama, a king to be to a Southern African nation, now known as Botswana. His/this story was not filled with any violence. In fact, there were none, but political tension was at high. More or less, everything depicted in the film was like a chess game. Each opponent had their time with their pawns moved in the right direction to check their opponents. So he had to play accordingly for his nation and its people. I think he handled so well without any violence and that's why this film was merely a simple drama rather than packed with full of twist and turns and stunts."", ""Like any biopic, it is an inspiring film. The implementation of non- violent tool to fight back was at its best in a film I've seen. Though, he was not like the most intelligent man, fighting it on his way, but an average man with a good education and character. The film opened with his final days in London as his law practice is coming to end. Then, unexpectedly, he meets a white woman. After going out with her for a few dates, they find love for each other. The real hurdle comes between them when the Britain government tries to break their relationship because it would affect their interest in his resourceful nation in Africa and peace with their neighbours."", ""?Let us not allow the ugliness of this world to take our joy away from us.?"", ""As he was banished from returning to his native, separated from his family, how he works hard to bring the peace and stability to the region, especially to come out of the British oppression was the rest of the story to focus on. An amazing film. I liked it because it was not about heroism or working under a spotlight since he comes from the royal family. His simplicity of life and approach to all the problems was uplifting. I never heard that a nation ever got its independence without spilling a drop of blood. This is the one, at least for me. I mean no guns, or any other kind of weapons, except small, small protests impacting big way. But the big sacrifices were made in other ways. That's the major reason for I love it."", ""Based on the book, 'Colour Bar'. The screenplay was slow, but it required to slow down to impact the atmosphere of passing time as the film spans with just important events for 4-5 years. So, assuming the film lacked depth is a misconception. Shot in both England and Botswana. The two different continents and its landscapes tell the story of its own. I mean the long distance between these two nations and distinct between the cultures, their own agenda to fight what's right for them. The initial part was like a pure romance film, and then suddenly the political tension takes the centre stage. Between the romance and politics, the narration keeps its flow without much progression in the middle section. Yet, impressive."", ""As for me, Seretse Khama was a much, much better role than Martin King Luther Jr. that the David Oyelowo has played. But that role was more popular as it was an American. So this film needs a big uplifted, since the film has not reached a wider audience. Felt like I'm seeing Rosamund Pike after a long time. She was excellent as Ruth. The rest of the cast in the small parts were not bad. It was an Oscar product, but no one ever mentioned that. If you are interested in history of Botswana, particularly in the time surrounding its independence, you should try it. But I think it is a must see film, one of the best films based on a king, a freedom fighter and a husband."", ""8/10"" ]"

This time he has chosen to tell us the story of a Sri Lankan Tamil Eelam freedom fighter who had fled to France after the war, followed by his struggles in the new place. The entire film was in Tamil language, but there some French dialogues too. I have been waiting for this, even after I got many opportunities, I had postponed them for some reasons. Finally, I'm very happy for not just got over it, but for the film that has powerful contents to give a peek into the immigrant's lifestyle, I mean not in a pleasant way."", ""Right now it is a huge issue around the world to curb the immigration, especially the illegal ones. But some reasons are really heartbreaking, like in the film 'The Good Lie'. Usually the people like in this story are not welcomed, so they have to lay low and swallow all the troubles they bump into. Sometime the events reflect what happened back in the homeland. In a such way this tale takes place where a civil war fighter, Dheepan, from Lanka lands in France with his fake family of a wife and a daughter named Yalini and Ilayaal respectively."", ""In order to forget the past, he tries his best to start over a new life. Since he did not come wealth, he had to adapt whatever life offered to survive and to protect his family. Knowing living on the edge of the fire, they were left alone, but how long, because the fire flame always catches the vulnerable objects around it. So what comes later is the finale with a twist and to follow the end credits."", ""I have seen many films about what this film was focused on, but this was somewhat different, mainly because of people from the culture of less known geographical area. I can understand Tamil, but I found hard to get this Sri Lankan Tamil lines. There were films about Sri Lankan refugees, those films like 'Nandha', 'Kannathil Muthamittal' are different kinds. Maybe this is the first western film to dig on Lankan Eelam topic, especially after the end of civil war and far away from the home. Though it does not take a side, except opening scene, the rest of the film is set in France."", ""\""Sometimes, they say things and laugh. I understand all the word, but they don't sound funny\"""", ""They have got a simple storyline, but developed to its best. The progression becomes stronger, particularly when it reaches the final stage. I think the filmmakers did a good research, especially the cultural differences to highlight. That's the most of the film concentrated to only on the one perspective, but the threats what people like them face was also brought into the narration. Like caught between the two worlds and culture, and to defend themselves, to do what has to be done."", ""Very realistic approach, but the question is do the things like this happen in real, especially in France? If you like Jacques Audiard films, then you should not miss it at all. These main actors are kind of new in front of the camera and they were amazing. Technically as well the film sounds good, but as I had heard, the filmmakers were hurried to finish it off when the Cannes Film Festival was around the corner. I think they have managed everything properly, and you would too appreciate the effort once you watch it."", ""It went to numerous film festivals and won some awards that includes Palme d'Or at Cannes. Kind of must see by the director's fans, even if you are not a fan, it is still worth a watch. Because you won't get another this or seen before. Even if you did, the cast wasn't the familiar one. That's the big difference here. The film has a message like, what one must be doing in his second chance of life. There are violences, feels strong, though the effects are raw, not the events or the scenes. Definitely not a masterpiece, but still I would recommend it for the adults."", ""8/10"" ]"

Since then, we all thought LEGO was a new format in 3D animation like Anime in 2D Animation. So I was expecting very eagerly what could be the second LEGO film. When they had announced it was going to be 'Batman', many 'Batman' fans were elated. So here we are."", ""It took a longer time than expected to hit the screen. I'd lost hope in this, because all the sweet memories of the firs LEGO film were fading away from me. So I could not say or think anything about it. That's all changed once I watched it. While watching it, everything was restored like waking up after I was knocked down with a big blow to the head. That reminded how badly I missed it. One of the best animations. It can't be compared to the normal animation. It is more like a jerky type, similar to stop-motion, but done in softwares."", ""Anyway, it was not about the animation. It was the story and dialogues. The best Batman film was a very serious film, but this one was so fun. For all ages, a non stop entertainment guaranteed. The surprise was all the villains coming together in one place. When the Batman ignores his arch-rival, the Joker, he is set to redefine his position to fight the Batman. His comeback endangers the whole Gotham city. Then the black clad, the Batman, with the support of his sidekicks, fights to save the city from devastating. The remaining is how it all ends."", ""The voice-over artists were awesome, but first, my praise goes to the screen and dialogue writers. As I said, nothing was great in animation, especially if you had seen the previous LEGO film. All one can see is LEGOS everywhere, the world, the city, the characters made of LEGOS and then even the explosives and other special effects are kind of LEGO brick style visual. But top to bottom a very enjoyable film. An animation that should not be missed. Probably it could contest in the upcoming Oscars. Now all my eyes are towards 'Ninjago'. Bring it on."", ""8/10"" ]"
the-daughter;9;2;LeZee;"[ ""When a secret long hidden makes its way out..."", ""A very surprising Aussie film. Not all the Australian film makes big at the world stage. So this film was not known to many people, but I am lucky to watch this. The film was based on the Norwegian play called 'The Wild Duck'. It was adapted several times for the screen, but this is the latest and a modernised version. The first film for the director and he was amazing in handling the screenplay as well. Obviously I did not know anything about the film. The cast looked good and also the storyline, so that's my reason to watch it. It began like a simple drama about a family who are going through a difficult time after the wood mill was shut down in their small town. Their's daughter, Hedvig, who is studying in the high school worries that she's going to lose her boyfriend if they move out of the town. That's not it, the narration had layers like from other people surrounding this small family and their perspective too has a big impact on the storytelling."", ""Not just this family, but many from the town were out of the job and that leads to some unexpected decisions. Another family who ran that wood mill for nearly a century, welcomes their son, Christian from the United States who is having a tough time with his girlfriend and also to attend his father's wedding. He accidentally meets his childhood friend which is actually a Hedvig's father. They spend lots of time together and that's where a new issue arises. Christian reveals some hidden truth for the decades between their two families. Everything breaks loose and becomes impossible to fix it. From all this, the daughter is the one who directly get affected, but to learn how is why you should watch this film."", ""You won't immediately understand the meaning of the title. The film very smartly progresses like bit by bit with lots of suspense around. The best part is, it never reveals the actual secret at any length of the film, but still the viewers going understand the situation very clearly. That's really amazing, particularly the writing being so clever. I don't know the original material which is more than a hundred year old, but I loved this to tell the story in a smart way."", ""\""You do not need to be scared of the truth.\"""", ""The characters were the best part of the story. The switching time was excellently done. Like the whole film is not intended to deal with one particular issue, but multiple. Everybody had something to deal with, some were personal and some were concerned for their whole family. The story always engaged with details, so there's no time for relaxation for the viewers. In the first half it succeeds to keep everything neat, despite the story developed from different angles. Because the end pulls them all together to conclude the tale on high. High mean, neither happy or sad, the timing when the twist takes place was a perfect setting."", ""If you are a melodrama fan, this must not be missed. I haven't seen a good tearjerker for a long time and then I found this one unexpectedly. I did not know the film would turn this way, but that's one of the reasons why I liked it a lot. The twist at the final act was kind of predictable if you were focused enough in the early part, but nobody gets a clear picture of how it all ends. That's the point. Despite how the film characters react when the suspense was revealed, we have our own respond too, but unable to deliver where it requires. That is funny, but the film gets very serious towards the final segment and you get no time to react, you will be like unmoved till the end credits roll up. But sensing a tragedy is certain."", ""I recently saw 'Fathers & Daughter', that I anticipated something what this film offered. The story lines are completely different from these two films, but that father and daughter relationship thing, I liked very much from this one. Especially the emotions are the most crucial to narrate the tale and this film was way better in that perspective. Comparison between these two titles only on the sentimental side, other than that it's not fair to bring a debate on them. Anyway, both are the fine melodrama."", ""This film definitely would appeal strongly to the family audience and I highly recommend it to them. There's no strong nudity or the sex scenes, but thematically it goes some length to record the required event. Other than those couple of parts, this is a film for everybody. Very satisfied with the overall film. I might not consider it my favourite, but very close to be called one. Like I said the story was thoroughly written, so I'm feeling this film won't go unnoticed. I am not talking about it would find its audience, but the remakes. European, Korean, Bollywood, even a Hollywood version might come. So fingers crossed, but I suggest this one to watch if you are convinced with my review."", ""8.5/10"" ]"

Because this might be a fresh attempt in the Korean film, at least for the first time I'm seeing in a Korean film, but not from the world cinema. Yeah, I have seen plenty, and I'd liked most of them. But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know."", ""Just over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clichés, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent."", ""So a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out. This film is not entirely a serious episode, despite the theme was. A little bit of satire. If that's how the film was intended or not, at least I had a couple of good laughs. Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves."", ""?Don't be weak and say you'll die, just live.?"", ""The trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out."", ""Meanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness."", ""All the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale."", ""A small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it.

So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films.

Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking."", ""The film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle."", ""One thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional.

There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness."", ""A man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island.

His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right."", ""It was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in."", ""Although my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that."", ""I'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version.

So they made sure it to easily accessible by everyone around the world in different platform. Some people are encouraged when they watch films like this, but soon after they go to their regular thing. We do not need that kind of attitude here, because it is already late and we can't reverse the damages that's already been done, though it can be prevented from happening further. Like I said in my 'Racing Extiction' review, a small contribution by everyone matters a lot."", ""The actor who is appointed as the United Nations 'Messenger of Peace' is set to travel the world for three years to observe and collect the information about the impact of man made global warming. Actually, he never asked any genuine question to whom he's interviewing for this documentary, like they are maybe the experts, scientists or the leaders around the world. But the goal was covered, even if it was a small amount. Because the first thing you have to understand about this film is, unlike any similar climate change documentaries, this did not try hard to give a complete picture on its topic. It was just an observation and its report kind of film by an actor who was chosen by the UN."", ""\""If you consider this vastness of this universe, this planet earth is just a small boat. If this boat is sinking, then I think we will have to all sink together.\"""", ""At some point, this film was beyond that. We had seen all the debates in the previous documentaries, but the perspectives were different with the same message, I mean the warning. Because it does not stop here, if we does not change and the message is going to be very louder and louder every time. What the actor saw through his own eyes on his journey were the separate incidents/disasters from different parts of the world what we had seen in a single film like '2012'. And who knows, that kind of collapse might go to happen as well in a near future if we don't act today."", ""The common line from all these documentaries are 'the global warming is real and it's happening right now'. But to whom it is said? For every person, the citizens of the earth, including you and me. I liked what in this film they pointed out, that the leaders listens people who voted them. Because they say only what we wanted to listen. So if we pressure them, they will fall in line. And this thing is badly needed to come to effect in the United States. If the America change their attitude, so the world would, because that's what had followed in the 21st century. But it seems they are lagging behind compared to the Baltic countries who are going fossil fuel- free nations."", ""This film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story. So do we need one if the polar ices completely meltdown? The answers is a big YES. Like the one that we saw in the film '2012'. Not for the whole world, but for those poor little island inhabitants. The continent's coast locals will relocate to inland. The fun part is the islanders did nothing big to suffer this, but those who did are going to be kind of safe in the mainland."", ""Every living organism, either in the land or in the ocean has the right to live just like us. So we must look from their perspective as well, because we're controlling the earth, not they are. We decide the earth's fate and it should be a good one, keeping in mind humanity's future as well."", ""This film has done its job, it's now on us to act. Don't think it is the government or the corporate's job, we all have our part to contribute and yes, it is so tiny, but the result will be enormous when we saw it together with everyone's contribution. Just watching a film like this is no use, we need to educate around us, especially for those has no opportunity to watch them or unable to understand them. This is a must see film and try to share the disc with your friends and colleagues. Because keeping it in your blu-ray/DVD case safe forever is no use.

That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one."", ""Entirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds."", ""Continued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film."", ""Now this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome.

Everybody contributed in some way to fight against the evil. The screenplay was shared by all the great actors, even small role ones equally.

That's patriotism!"", ""In the opening, you could see different people from different places of Boston preparing for the big event.

This is the part I loved it. Hunting pisslam pigs are always so pleasure to watch."", ""Suspense, thriller, the story was well paced and took forward with a wonderful ending. Awesome direction. Another hit in a single year alongside 'Deepwater Horizon'. Interesting, Wahlberg involved in both these films. I've also heard that the two screenplays was merged to make a single film. One was a drama and the other one was an action packed story. That's why it was well balanced between everything. From individual's story to together in the events. A must see film."", ""8.5/10"" ]"

But the thing is, in his style, adding a slight fun, romantic, poetic, all together works so well. I still remember how I become his fan after watching 'Stranger Than Paradise'."", ""As usual, he wrote the story for this film. Even if he'd to borrow from another source, the screenplay is generally his. For this film, it was original & that's what worked out awesomely. But he had to borrow some poems from his favourite poet, Ron Padgett. A great team work, because when their work came together, the film became a masterpiece. It was nothing less than any literature, for sure. Definitely this film should turn into a book. The readers deserve their own imagination of this tale."", ""This is the story of a man's life in a week's time. Starts from Monday and ends on next Monday. So, his name's Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson. A happily married man, & love his profession. In the meantime, he's a poet. He has kept a book where he writes his poems, especially during his lunch time, even in the small breaks when he gets. His mind's always filled with thoughts. Chanting words, verses."", ""His inspirations are the places he goes through his bus & the strangers who ride in his bus. Their each others conversation about their lives & experiences is his motivation. His wife is an interesting character too. Sadly, she wasn't focused as much as he was. Though there're enough scenes to enjoy the role. But I think she deserves her solo film, from another angle, about her life, her hobby which her husband backs."", ""It's a simple, normal life. Without much trouble, a peaceful life the most people would ask for. The film isn't everything about him. But he's the centre of the story. When other, one time characters enter the screen. It's because of his presence around them. Hence some interesting facts revealed. Just like our life when we ride a public transport where we come in to contact with many passengers coming & going in different stops. But all the above, what they talk, which we, everybody in the bus listen without hesitation. Paterson is a person who learns every day out of that."", ""?Poetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.?"", ""His other activity's walking his dog out at every night. It's an opportunity for him to mix with some friends at the pub he had made with frequent visits. The place which has its own story as the film progresses. So all these stuffs keeps repeating every day like what we call a mechanical life. But Paterson is neither enjoying it nor depressed over. He usually does best out of the given time & place. The difference is, not every day're same. Even a slight change in order of activity brings a new thing in. His wife insists him to publish his works. But the narration strikes with an unexpected twist before the end."", ""I have said many times when I liked the films I've watched that they are so poetic. But it's very rare to find a film from top to bottom being very poetic. Recently I saw one, in fact, two from Japan known as 'Little Forest' duology. And now this one. Particularly if you love poetry or if you're yourself a poet, then this is a must see. Surely you would love it. As well as a good film to gift to any such person you know in your life. Believe me, this film is like a wine bottle. As it gets older, it'll turn the best. I've already changed my stance twice & rated better every time. I consider it is a bit low rated right now. But only time will answer to that."", ""For me, it is the director's top 3 films. I have seen Adam Driver in many films, he's not considered a solo lead actor, because of marketing purpose. But he's really good which proved in this flick. So it is his best performance I have seen so far. He really took the driving classes to learn drive the bus to perfect his character. That's the dedication the creator of the film expects from his cast. How much I loved it means, I'm eager for a sequel, despite knowing this kind of films are one-off. Otherwise, I'll be happy if the director and him join the hands once more time for a new project."", ""Very slow moving tale. But not a boring film. If I had watched it when I was a teenager, I don't think I would have felt similarly. From middle aged people to the older ones, they are the target audience. In order to see and feel what this film reveals, one must have experience in real life. Hence, not all the youngsters, particularly the teenagers would thumb up. In my world, this kind of films is the Oscar worthy. I would have surely nominated the film, as well as the director and the lead actor. So by now you would have learnt what my final word could be.

I had a misconception during my childhood that all tribal people, mostly from the deep jungles are so cruel just like the North Sentinel Island people. I never visited such place or met such people, but some documentaries and feature films taught me many things. This is one of those films to highlight them and their culture."", ""The people from the Tanna island rejected to adopt the outside culture just to save theirs, which is used to be thousands of years old. Everything was taught to their kids, from hunting and gathering to the growing fruits, vegetables and livestocks. But they too have rivals with their neighbour tribe that sometimes end with casualties on the both sides. This film was a romance-drama, when the young couple's love was rejected by their elders, how they fought for it, which forced to bring a reform in their custom was told."", ""This is like the Vanuatu's version of Romeo-Juliet tale. While watching it, my heart was pounding faster. Because since I don't know these people and their traditions, I thought something terrible going to happen sooner or later. The film did not have any strong violence, but the storyline led to such situation often. Even in the final stage, they silently ended the narration with a message.

We have to hold it tight to survive.\"""", ""Their performances were natural, since the events of the film were based on their daily life. So they knew what they were doing. It was an advantage for the filmmakers, like they were making a documentary, despite they wrote the screenplay for it. Everyone played their own real life character to depict the actual event. Particularly the lead ones, Dain, Wawa, Selin and a few others were impressive. Awesome cinematography, as well as background score. The locations were amazing, including that live volcanic mountain. Despite their presence in the region for centuries, it looks untouched and wild."", ""This film is what something you won't see in your daily life. It was not a romance like in our society, but men and women falling in love in any culture/society are the same. The film was not entirely a love tale, but step by step it gets there. In the initial parts, it was an introduction to their customs with a little fun. Followed by revealing they are not alone. Then comes the turn in the story where the remaining parts have a new fast paced thrill look."", ""My point is we have seen hundreds of romance films, but this is one of those rare ones where 90 per cent of the world never going to meet these real people in their lives. So thanks to the filmmakers for giving this beautiful precious film. The first feature film for the documentary filmmakers and it made into the American Academy Awards. A great achievement, especially recognising such film by the Australian film society, as well as the Academy juries for nominating it."", ""I'll be looking forward and cheering for them on their red carpet appearance.

The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully."", ""From the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play.

Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield."", ""He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed.

That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it."", ""He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation.

This is a must see film, especially if you have a kid(s) in the home, show it to them. Being the parents, uncle and aunt, that's one of the best thing you would do for them. Because no one knows when and where kids gets their confidence boost, inspiration or discovering a new path. You can't compare films with real life, even it was a biopic.

For the present generation, if you are familiar with a few similar works from the past, then you would predict this film. I mean not the entire film, but some scenes are at its initial stage can be foreseen. Because sometimes, some developments are called coincidence, but when you have plenty of them, that is called very intentional. That was the only negative of this film. By avoiding them the tale would not be possible. In other way, it could have had stretched even further which are unnecessary details."", ""I did not care the clichés. For me it was a fine drama. The performances were magnificent. It looked to me an Oscar worthy, from both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. Even Rachel Weisz was for the supporting role. So tick marks for cast and locations, also the screenplay and score. But the sad part is the film was not received very well, especially by the jackass film critics."", ""It's not the same case with regular movie goers, particular I think the older and matured people would like it better. But it's not another 'Pride and Prejudice' from the family audience perspective. The events of the film and the outcome can be wrongly judged. Most importantly, it sets in the same world as ours, so everything is the near fact based. So the right and wrongs are inside the film, but not applicable for the filmmaking which I think a well done job."", ""The post climax scene, the one that comes before the end credit was very good. For this kind of tale, that kind of outro sets a final tone. Despite not an inspiring storyline, all the portrayal in the film was so poetic. Mainly because of slow narration with high influence of sentiments and most of the occasions being dialogueless. The length was not an issue if you like period dramas. Anyway, it was engaging theme, there's always something keeps happening. So I think this is one of the under-rated films of the year. It deserves much better recognition. If you haven't watched it yet, I recommend it and highly if you are 30+."", ""8/10"" ]"
the-handmaiden;8;1;LeZee;"[ ""In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud."", ""Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents."", ""Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises."", ""The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko."", ""?So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.?"", ""So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story."", ""But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part."", ""The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book."", ""Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!"", ""8/10"" ]"

First of all I did not know John Krasinski directs films. In fact, this is his second feature film, the only one I have seen and I loved it. The main reason to I enjoy it was, it is sentimental. Not just some foolish melodrama, but an uplifting film filled with lots of fun."", ""The cast was at its best. I liked everyone and their unique display. At some point it feels like a realistic drama, but those comedies make us realise that it's only a film. Margo Martindale was really awesome. I have never seen her in such a wonderful role. Most importantly in an important role like this one. If I remember this film in the future, that's only for her. The only negative about the film was the twist. It was like they aimed for it to bring change in pace and atmosphere, when the situation in the story was not in its favour. Even though I did not care it, and thoroughly enjoyed it."", ""This is the story of the Hollar family who reunite when they needed for each other. When John comes to know his mother got ill, he immediately flies back home. His brother is already there and the father is financially struggling. With many struggles, they all prepare for the medical procedure. In the meantime, there are some outside adventures. Like meeting their old friends, places, ex-wife et cetera. The remaining of the film is to reveal how it all goes and where they will stand."", ""The target audience is mainly the families. If you like a tearjerker, you would enjoy watching it as well. So in my opinion, this film is under-rated and under-noticed. Mainly because of the cast is not so popular and so the lack of promotion. Even the film poster is not that impressive. Kind of looks like a B movie and of course it is, but an awesome B movie. Worth a watch for many reasons and you will know it when you give it a try. So, recommended."", ""8/10"" ]"

Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit."", ""It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico.

It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any.

This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing."", ""As it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class. One of the best biopic that's not based on one's whole life, but one heroic attempt which will be remembered him and this film for forever."", ""8/10"" ]"

The problem is she's not any good. Not just him, but everybody who is close to them and once laughed at her, try to understand them and give their support.

So on one such a big event, the disaster strikes and how it affects the couple is the rest of the tale to disclose."", """", ""A very surprising film. I thought it was just a comedy like it brings small smiles on our face, but I laughed out loud on many occasions. This is definitely a right time, because I felt like it was a music and cinematic version of the American presidential candidate Don Trump. Yep, there not much difference, but still this film is some way inspiring, not Trump. It says you must never give up on your dream. As much as you laugh watching it, as much you realise how hard chasing a dream to be if one is very passionate about something, but does not have the talent to reach the height. The message is very similar to the film 'Eddie the Eagle'. Do you think everybody got talent in the world, so I believe you should watch this and you will know why I'm telling you to watch it."", """", ""When I read about the film's storyline, I thought it was so silly. But when I learnt it is a biographical film, that interested me to have a look at it. It is truly an unbelievable film, in a sense of humour and overall a good way. The couple was rich, so they could do anything they want just like what Donald Trump believes. But both the things are not the same, especially this one is more about the real life struggle against the odds. In some parts, it gets more emotional and I loved that final line said by the wife. It's always, the participation that counts, not how you fared it."", """", ""Oh my god, another Oscars nominee is almost certain for the record holder Meryl Streep. Hugh Grant was equally amazing and this is one of the best of him I have seen, particularly in the recent times. One of the best main roles for Simon Helberg, he was not next best after the Streep and Grant. I still feel this film is underrated.

It does not stop there, the life threat tails him and all who were involved with him. Now the film reveals his real identity going back to disclose his childhood days, like how he grew up. In the meantime, he has to find those people who are after him before they do and so with a twist the film comes to an end."", ""Coming from a DC film, now Ben Affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. His physique was great for the role he played. Thanks to Batman role. This is like his version of 'John Wick' or 'Jack Reacher'. Definitely we can expect a sequel here. Anna Kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. In this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. The film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller.

And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces."", ""Firstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique."", ""Just like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed."", ""Visually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins.

The early days of the world war two, where the exile soldiers were sent to eliminate the nazi general Reinhard Heydrich, who was handling the Czechoslovakian affairs. From theirs preparation to the plan execution and the outcome of the result was what this film reveals for us."", ""A war film, that too was based on the real, especially the WWII means no need to say how powerful it would be. This was directed by the 'Metro Manila' filmmaker. An internationally produced film, but the cast does not have any big names. I mean Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy are not globally recognised, particularly when it comes to the film marketing. So it stumbled at the box office. I liked them both and the others as well. The film was not bad as criticised by the film critics. I would say make your own call after watching it."", ""It was so neat and clean on what it dealt with. The issue with it was too much blank space and then in the mid part where the assassination happened, the film came alive. Again towards the final, the pace gone up and finished strongly. So I think overall length should have been trimmed for a better narration/result. Not for me, I liked as it is now, but some viewers think it is a draggy."", ""Small budget film, but worth a watch. Because the production quality was great, no compromise on visuals or the settings, but most of them were shot in the real locations to give us the real effect. Definitely one of the best film among WWII related theme. Anyway, this is not a war film, but very much similar to the recent Korean film 'Assassination' about killing the Japanese general. Films like this are must see, because it reveals how much the people, the society and the nation struggled under the nazi atrocities. Surely recommended!"", ""8/10"" ]"

This film is not about that, but there's a reason to I bring that up in here."", ""This film is about a boy named Owen Suskind, who developed autism at the age of 3. Since then the journey of his life has been very hard, especially for his family who had tried to understand and find a solution for it.

All we common people know is that autistic people are sensitive, but genius or mastered in one particular thing they love the most. There's a pattern, and we have to jump in onto it to clear the way to bring both the worlds together. This had been done in the past, so in the present, but this film gives a new perspective to learn new methods."", ""This is not some medical achievement, but the desperate Owen's family found a way. That's a lovely family, they never gave up on him. His big brother as well, trying to teach the grownup's form of love was honest and realistic. Beyond that, his plan for their future together, which eventually one day would come. I know that some of the scenes were recreated from the Owen's life, just for this documentary film.

They used them to narrate the tale very beautifully. There are many fans in the world who love the sidekicks from their favourite films/animations. Even sometimes, I love them more than the film's heroes. If you do as well, try this, but this film is not about them and they were mostly the blurred animation version. Or you can say, except the film clips, the remaining original animations were simple sketch and acceptable quality."", ""In reality, I don't know the whole life story of Owen, but according to this film, what I learnt, I truly admire his father Ron. He's lucky to have such a father. This film was based on the book he wrote of the same name. And the whole family's effort given a new life to Owen. This film is nominated for the Oscars in the Best Documentary Feature list. But I'm not sure it'll win. Anyway a big thanks to the filmmakers to bring this up."", ""I know Disney is aware of this film since they allowed their contents to use in it. They can make a feature film out of it, a neat biopic. That would be a great honour for such a big fan of their works. But I'm particularly interested in the Owen's vision about his 'The Land of the Lost Sidekicks'. It's nothing less than the Marvel's 'The Avengers', but for the kids and for the fans of Disney's 2D animations like me from the pre 2000."", ""This film is not under-appreciated, but under-recognised as of now. So I hope you put this into your watch list. It is a good family film, a message in it. We're surrounded by all kinds of people, so it does not matter if the film is not for us, at least you will learn something out of it. That's the any documentary film's notion, as always.

The promotion begins from the day it was announced. So I did not realise when this one started to come to exist. But when I did come to know, all I know was it is an Eddie Murphy's film and I should give it a try. Because I felt like I haven't seen him for a decade."", ""After watching it, I totally stunned and asked myself is this the same Eddie we used to enjoy his comedies? Yep, but no. I mean the guy was the same, but I saw completely a new of him as an actor. He definitely chose a best script and this is the break he was looking for all these years. Initially Samuel L. Jackson was considered for the lead role, later replaced by him. I won't be surprised if he gets the Oscar nomination for the role he played. I don't care whether it is for a lead or supporting role, but I'll be very happy for the nod.

Like they usually say the adaptation to the screen is ruined the original material. Anyway, I'm film guy, I like books turned into the films, because I'm lazy to read them. But it was inspired by the real friendship, that's what the opening statement says. Which was actually from the writer's real life, though I believe many parts were altered and the new stuffs included. I'm sure I won't find another film like this any time soon, so maybe I would re-watch it."", ""\""It's an awful feeling to love someone so much that you absolutely hate them for leaving you.\"""", ""It has been a very long time since I have given a maximum score for a film. When I started to watch it, I did not think it would be the one, but it deserved that honour. The main reason was to I love it, it has no clichés, I mean almost 90 per cent free from them. The first thing was, I though it is a food film and then it turned that down with only required amount of those contents keeping in its narration. Followed by I thought it could turn into a romance, but once again that theme as well sidelined to focus on the different event, I mean the series of events."", ""So now you might be confused what I am blabbering. Actually, this is the story of a ten year old girl till she reach her middle age and during that period of time, about a man who entered her life and stayed very close despite each other never revealed their personal life. Her school graduate and college days, followed by many events of her personal life as similar to the Mr. Church's life events at the same time, the film only concentrated the unusual relationship between them. So there's nothing wrong to call it another version of 'Driving Miss Daisy'. In fact, it was made by the same director."", ""Like I said, Eddie Murphy nailed his part. I hope he does more serious films like this and according to his age. I think this is what Adam Sandler should follow as well. The entire story was told from the Charlie's perspective that payed by the young sensation Britt Robertson. She was good as the Eddie, but her character was not designed to highlight the film, instead her character highlights Eddie's Mr. Church. She only reveals what she saw with her own eyes about the person she respects, despite it all began with a simple dislike. Beside she never had a father, never knew who her father was, so the Mr. Church takes that place conveniently without their's knowledge."", ""A heartwarming drama for the whole family. I did not find any obscene parts. It is now in my all time favourites list. The length was perfect and the pace was excellent. There's no major twist, like that stuns you at the final stage, but there were many small twists and turns all along. The film critics got all wrong, like usual, they proved they got no brain. This is a inspiring film. You will learn how to respect people around us, who respect us. Like cooking, books, caring for each other, privacy, many fine topics were covered. So watching it with the youngsters and kids might boost their moral attitude. So I feel it is a perfect weekend family film. Highly, strongly recommended."", ""10/10"" ]"

Even though I'm not familiar with the original material I would say it was one of the best novel-to-screen translation I have seen. The long runtime has never been the issue, but slowly, solidly told tale. My only disappointment is that it was not in the Scottish language since it was about a Scottish family."", """", ""There were many Scottish dialects that I did not get at first, so I had to google them to know the meaning.

The story sets in the 1910s that centres on a farm girl named Chris. An epic life journey from the girlhood to womanhood. Under her atrocious father, the film tells how the whole family was living in the fear. After a death in the house, the event slowly begins to tear the family apart, leaving Chris behind to take the ultimate decisions about her future and the family land."", """", ""Anybody would definitely feel bored in the initiation part, because you won't understand the story right away. If you manage to survive in the first half, then you can easily get through in the remaining by liking it a lot. It was nothing like we know the story or we don't, it was simply about the twist and turns of somebody's life just like ours, except it was from a different timeline. Precisely to say the phases of life is what this film is all about. Like shifting the gear in the car, according to the condition of the road and the destination. The joy and sorrow are the part of the life which is sometimes depends on the decision we and around us make."", """", ""\""You will need to face men for yourself. When the time comes, there's no one can stand and help.\"""", """", ""It was totally an unexpected film, kind of reminded me 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Love Comes Softly'. Focused mainly on a woman, in the men dominated world. It was not just a rural theme, but also sometimes takes us beyond to other topics. Like during the first world war and under the English dominated UK, how the Scots lost the rights and their culture disappeared. No doubt why Scots are asking for their own nation."", """", ""The romance was another turning point in the story, like raising strong from the fall. After seeing lots of similar changes, I was unable to predict what conclusion may come. But it was strong and intentional with some wonderful dialogues. I loved the beautiful landscapes from the different seasons. It was actually shot in the New Zealand, Scottland and Luxembarough. There's no expansion in the locations, mainly it sets in and around a farmhouse and very occasionally other than these parts."", """", ""The one in the Chris' shoe was amazing. Like usual, Peter Mullan was fantastic and similarly others as well in their short stay. As the story progress, consequently the film characters reshuffled. Even for us, the main character Chris is like crossing through a juncture from the coming-of-age to self-discovery. Displaying the transformation of Chris from a certain period of time was the film's great achievement. Like how a landscape change from the dawn to dust, this woman's life sees the same fate. That's what the title implies."", """", ""I don't know this British director, but this film opened a new door to me further to check it out his other works. I don't know either that everybody would like it, but it is really one of the wonderful drama of the 2015 and I recommend it to all, especially if there's no problem for you for a long story told in the slow pace.

When America was fighting a civil war, a man named Newton Knight returned home from the battlefield where he started to help the farmers who were robbed by the armymen. Its like they are fighting their own war, to protect the land and the crops. They knew the consequence and so they were prepared for it."", ""This is over a two hour long film and I think they had covered everything nicely.

In the opening scene only they had shown us the war, but very soon it moved away to tell what's happening off the battlefield. Like how it's affecting the people. So the resistance emerges and the days going by they gain large power in the region. Very interesting perspective, though everything in the film was not true despite overall plot was inspired by the history."", ""Matthew McConaughey alone steered the ship.

Newspapers, media might fail to report them in a long-range, because it is less interested in the other side of the world, but movies like this ensures the outreach."", """", ""I think this is my first Ethiopian movie. All the cast and story take place in this landlocked East-African country. The narration often switches between a small village and the capital city. Based on the real and historical even about one of the oldest blind belief over marrying a girl when she and her family denied the permission. It's set in the year 1996, the story of a 14-year-old girl Hirut who'd successfully escaped from her abductor, but not without a blow en-route. Now she's facing a charge which she had done in self-defence and the rest is her fight in the court of law."", """", ""As usual, everything is fine in our society, so things won't change and it does not have to, until something terrible happens. As to what this film talks, the law was not written in a single day and some of them are overlaps with traditional culture which definitely need a serious reconsideration. It keeps changing until finding a correct solution. Take our society as an example, now the homosexual and marijuana laws were getting friendlier than ever. This story is another example of patching the loopholes in the law. It might come after a horrible incident, but makes sure that it won't repeat."", """", ""\""I can't even protect my little sister."", ""They will get her one day.\"""", """", ""The entire film was not a courtroom drama, but people's bonding and cultural exposure. Actings were wonderful, especially the main two characters, Meaza and Hirut. The pace and focus was largely on the topic, but a few glimpses of landscapes of the countryside made me wonder how beautiful the Ethiopia is. I think the cinematography was at its best. This film has been officially submitted for the last concluded Oscars (2015), and in my view it should have been nominated for the main event instead of 'Timbuktu'."", """", ""I thought it was a tale about some westerners who comes to help the little girl, or maybe adopt her, kind of stuffs. But it was purely a uni-national, uni-racial, its society and flawed judicial system which might give you a shock. After opening 30 minutes, I was pleased to have picked it to watch and ended highly satisfied when it ended. The conclusion was very emotional, especially the lines Hirut said was reflected what she went through and might going repeat for other girls."", """", ""This is highly recommended by me. This film needs viewers, to learn what's really happening out there. Especially in a male dominated society, how the children and women are coping to stand on their own feet. Because of the brave attempt by the brave women, the changes have come and building a better future for the next generation. So hats off to the director-cum-writer, producers and all the above those two ladies who are still carrying out their works to help the struggling women as the final report from film says.

So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts."", """", ""It was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book."", """", ""I know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs.

Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role.

It was another film like 'Midnight Diner' that I saw a couple of months back, which focused on a small eatery as this one. What fascinated me was its simple storyline and the realistic approach. It was based on the novel of the same name of the original Japanese title 'An' which translated as 'Bean Paste'. It is not just a food film, but well explored relationship of the people from different generations. This is quite common I found in the Japanese films, yet very distinct from other similar ones."", """", ""There were three characters in the films that kind of represents past, present and future. Where they all learn some important lessons from each others. I don't know that was intentionally done, but that is how I saw it. The most of the story's perspective was from the middle aged man, Sentaro who runs a small dorayaki shop which regularly visited by the students of the nearby school and the locals. His story is kind of depressing. Not the film, just what he went through in his life and after that his life remained quite a low without an alternative. Though, there were no flashbacks, but just revealed by orally when the right time comes."", """", ""One day a very old woman named Tokue comes asking for a job after seeing the signboard outside the shop and somehow she manages to grab it. Later she teaches him to make his own bean paste. This is the part I like very much, because it might have not revealed fully how to make a bean paste, but definitely you would feel you want to taste it right away when you see the beautifully prepared paste filled in the tray. So I won't be surprised if you visit a Japanese restaurant just to make your first taste of dorayaki or whenever you visit there, remember this film and ask for it."", """", ""\""It's like a first date, the young couple needs to get friendly.\"""", """", ""So with such a development, the film takes a leap to the next stage of the story.

On the other side a middle school girl, Wakana who has not decided about her future, whether to attend the high school or get a job in Takue's shop which obviously went to the old woman. In the meantime, all the three develop a close relationship to each other in the short time. Despite from the different social group, but the strong connection with the shop.

The director, who also wrote the screenplay did an awesome job. The cast's performances were outstanding. I have seen them all in different films, even though I did not recognise them at first. I think it is the actors and the wonderful cinematography that made this film looks better than its story. People put their recipe in a book and publish them or make the videos and release online, but I think this kind of film is definitely would make lot impact on, even for the non-food lovers to have a close look which would generate a serious desire and hunger. Just like 'The Ramen Girl', but not as good as this one. A film that preserves a precious dish digitally and makes reach corners of the world."", """", ""By now you know that I loved it, but there's something I did not like from it which is the third act. Actually, that final act was a bit drag. Compared to the earlier sections, those last 20 or so minutes were quite an unnecessary stretch. I am an easy prey to sentimental scenes, but for this film I did not feel a thing. Other than that, how it all ended pretty neatly wrapped which I applaud loudly."", """", ""Whatever I said all the good and bad stuffs about it, there are some other topics as well in it which came as a side message, but that overtook everything on the final stage and ended as it was the centre of the story like that about treating an older person with disability. I had said many times before in my earlier reviews that I easily fall for seeing the old people suffering which happened in this. So heartbreaking.

But throughout the narration, it is quite clear the world was affected by without the proper scientific progression and adaptation to save it. Avril might be the centre of the story, but the film character distributed widely and theirs story were well preserved to keep the excitement and pace steady till the end.

When the actual story ends, there's an extended scene which makes us to dream for a sequel to come. But it all ended here, so a follow-up is very unlikely. Apart from the story, the technical brilliance was like par with the Animes, especially it reminds Miyazaki's films. These directors must keep doing films like this and who knows they may become the French versions of Tomm Moore."", """", ""One of the best animations of the years. A sci-fi which is not a dystopian theme. I said that because that's what very common in the current films. Instead, it is a mid 20th century story and totally an entertaining film with the breathtaking visuals. The story wise, it is nothing less than any similar live-action themes. It should have been very popular by now, but it is not and the reason is it is not a Hollywood.

Anyway, the vfx was very impressive, the CGI characters looked even better than the previous one. Don't compare it with the DC or Marvel's films, it is setting up its own trend.

The tale was told with the beautiful visuals and music, without any dialogues to reach the audience making no complication.

He observes the changing world as his father bids a goodbye to him to look for a better job in the city, but never returned. So the curious little kid who loves his father very much takes us an adventure when industrial revolution taking place. The rest of the film tells whether he finds what he's looking for."", """", ""There were many animations got released in the same year, but this film got the Oscars nod because of the strong message. Especially in the present world this kind of film brings more awareness to the people. It focused the theme man destroying the beautiful world for the profit and dumping the waste everywhere.

Although it talks about the past and present than the distant future."", """", ""The pollution was one of the biggest concerns today and nobody cares to curb it. The industrial revolution is not defining our progressive, but threatening to our future generation. Besides the poors are directly affected by the loss of the employment.

Surely we all have similar kind of experience in our life about the place we had admired some time ago is now completely ruined."", """", ""It might have not won the Oscar or not popular as the one won, but definitely not ignorable film. All the other four nominees stood behind creativity and entertainment, but this one was with dual intention and it succeeded. It wins our heart more than any prestigious awards in the world, yet I agree the awards leads to the wider recognisation. So I urge everybody to watch it sooner or later, but never to miss it. It is not your Disney, Pixer or Ghibli films, but surely you would enjoy it. I don't know the director, but I think if he resumes with the same intensity for the future projects, he would definitely become the South American Tomm Moore with his unique animation and storytelling."", """", ""8/10"" ]"

It is not all about their farms, but the love and dedication towards their work. About the art of raising animals that passed through the generations who never abandoned their ancestral village to look for a better life somewhere else.

In my perspective, after seeing all the five, no doubt, but this film's the real winner. The film was loosely based on the real occurrence that was written in the diaries of two scientists on their expedition into the Amazon's deep in search of something what intrigued the conflict between the two worlds."", """", ""It portrayed the beautiful Amazon in the black and white pictures and I loved it because, it recreated the world that was over 100 years ago.

Because prior to the 80s and 90s, there were plenty of African and South American exploration films made which rapidly reduced its number when comic book films became the frontrunner in the world cinema.

Most of the film was shot alongside of the rivers Inirida and Varupes, especially the final scene location was so beautiful. The film concept was similar to the 'Anaconda 2', but there's no intense action-thriller, especially there's no fast and aggressive serpents in the act. The scientists are looking for a certain kind of plant which is considered sacred and protected by the Amazon tribes."", """", ""It was boring in the initial parts, because I did not know what to expect. So I just kept watching as whatever it was focused on. But during the end of the first act, I started to like it. Because it was not as complicated as I thought and it was not the art film like those without the plot and background score. So at the end of my watch, I'm very satisfied. The actors were stunning as the amazing Amazon basin is. Of them all, the 'Borgman' actor was the only familiar face to me."", """", ""It is a powerful film, with a bit of a documentary style presentation. The main theme was about the history repeating itself. In your lifetime if it repeats means a second chance to divert it from the possible future nuisance. So how the one who cares would reach and solve it is what this film was told. The film characters were brilliant and Karamakate will be remembered.

The first half was wonderful, then during in the middle I felt it lost its track, but it came back strongly to end. This tale focused mainly on the living-style of the reports in the hostile place, besides their tough jobs. The battle scenes were minimised and highlighted the journalism.

You can compare it to films like 'The Pursuit of Happiness', but it had its own way dealing with the story contents. This is not a comedy, but slightly it is fun, as well as inspiring. It narrates the world is full of good and bad, and how we react to them accordingly. Particularly the main character who was desperate to come out of the bad day and to have some quality time with his son. It actually stayed neutral on the topics like theism and atheism, which has some influence in the narration, but revolved carefully around the social and other issues.

That was really a good thing to focus on, maybe that's why I loved it."", """", ""The opening and the end take place in the same location, but the difference was the 24 hours and its events. During that time, a boy who was struggling between what his mother believes and his doubts over those beliefs were somewhat influenced to clear his mind. I mean it was not intentional, the film to explain us through the boy, but they were described in the way of someone's daily life base, except it was not an ordinary day for him/them.

I don't know how the religious people take it, but I enjoyed it, kind of it is an awareness theme about the reality of the human world. So my disappointment is not the film, but how it was received. Once again an English film from the other region was turned down by the Americans.

Except the only bothering thing was the children never grew physically, while the cars, clothing style, society, cameras, the timeline has kept changing. But it did not leap extremely forward like a decade or something. That was not a big issue, while the film and its story telling kept the rhythm always on the high. Yep, there's no dull moments, whenever it began to sink under the emotion, repelled back with the same force which is why I hooked all the way. By the way I thought those innocent family sentiments were strongly appealing in a cute manner."", """", ""Now we talk about the roles. Mark Ruffalo definitely deserves an Oscars nomination. But I can't declare the award for him as I have to find out how the other actors performed in their films. This is his best film in a lead I have seen, probably his career best. To me it is this year's version of the last year's JK Simmons performance for the movie 'Whiplash'."", """", ""\""Our dad is totally polar bear.\"""", """", ""The other side, Zoe Saldana was as usual in a charming and polite character. As I know she never disappoints her fans. Ruffalo and Saldana are one of the best on screen pair, looked so real, like a real couple. The two little girls were also awesome in their debuting film. The entire movie's focus was these four members, very occasionally outside characters come into play with hardly any lines to deliver. I wondered what is the meaning of the title and if your focus is on, you won't miss the explanation, which was so cute."", """", ""An amazing fusion between the incredible narration and the background score. The tracks (some of them are not OST) as well very good that played till the credits rolled out. I liked 'The Pirate Song' that was written by the director and 'Oogum Boogum' was funny. Many of them I heard for the first time and thinking to grab them for my movie song collection. Overall, it will surely transform your mood by the end of the movie, I mean in a good way."", """", ""Inspiring, yes the film inspires to have our own little family with kids. Especially a perspective of a father and his great responsibility was portrayed tremendously. And also the girls who saved their father from being lost. They stayed for each other and stayed that way as how a parent and his children should be as an example, but in a little harsh human nature."", """", ""It is a rare gem, undoubtedly completely enjoyable. This was one of those that came silently into the productions. The earlier posters were unimpressive and made me stay away, but later, now it turned out one of my favourite flick from the 2015.

Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made."", """", ""The movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests.

I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see.

So how things shape up within the family, who lose, who gain and what happens at the end is the remaining."", """", ""The title says it is a Jenny's wedding, but the wedding is a small part, the rest is all about Jenny's family. While portraying the family about how they're coping with the news, I liked how the film focused one at a time and their way of coming out of the frame they're in. Mostly it was the perspective of the women, because the writer was a woman, so she knew how to carve it. That's why the father's part slightly lacked the exhibition, nevertheless, that's the only male character that has to be so tough."", """", ""Such a wonderful narration, totally an unexpected movie. Surely one of the underrated movie of the year. The cast was fantastic. Among all the characters, Alexis Bledel's role was disappointingly shorter.

Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway."", """", ""You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here."", """", ""This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people."", """", ""So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part."", """", ""From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments.

There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups.

This film centres only two characters that wonderfully played by the 80 year-old Robert Redford as a 60 year-old Bill Bryson and the other one was Nick Nolte as Katz who actually stole the show.

If you decide to watch it, I suggest to give a try with your best friend, because you both might be seeing the future of yourselves. My finishing statement is, it is definitely not a must see, but it won't disappoint either if you're not anticipating in a large scale adventure, that includes emotions and severeness. If it was from before the 90s, probably considered as a good film, but in this modern CGI world, movies about life and self-discovery is fading away from the young people's mind.

You know I collect the good ones from the movies I watch, so I had many pauses. It sentimentally strikes strongly, that means you can't wet your eyes, but can be felt in your deep heart.

If you pass that then the following segments interest you to make you guess the possibilities the suspense it hold. Kind of impossible to predict because of the introduction of the related characters to the particular incident consumed by the three quarters of the film. Which mean twist comes at the latter part which was really a good one. Each character that comes in the different episodes were incredible. Like, for a moment it was unhooked from the rest and centralizes that specific story stream, but the common event holds the story all together.

Because monsters should behave like one not like one of a Marvel's superhero who concerns for human safety. That is the portion made me think like is it a children's movie?

Compared to 'An Unexpected Journey' it had a little more drama in story narration but as usual it had the adventures that happen in a tight situation.

In all the last four movies I have not seen talking animal as per my knowledge.

The British actor Benedict Cumberbatch gave his incredible voice and performance through motion capture to the Smaug."", """", ""There's nothing we can do than have a peek while it is in the cinema hall.

Aoi Miyazaki never stops impressing me where she appears here as a mother. Her roles from various movies are always coming with a surprise who peaking high and higher, she really rocks. The two kids' characters as well very adorable. Like the two sisters in 'My Neighbour Totoro' these two made the movie look great. Actually it was a tale about a mother who raises two wolf children. As a single parent, her hard work and dedication to the kids to grow up having a normal and happy childhood she must sacrifice her life."", """", ""When her husband dies, Hana must take care of the kids where she lacks the knowledge of their kind to give support.

The story commenced with a nice love story with a little heartbreak. Then the most enjoyable parts begin with lots of laughs until the approach of the end where it brings lots of emotions before concluding with a powerful howl. It had very nice background score in all the crucial portion of the tale. In other word to say, the movie was just like what I expected and more than that. I felt the movie was short and was not ready to accept the end. You know,  it is better being short and sweet than with unnecessary drag in a tale. This is a movie that everyone will love, especially kids and families. Like I said if you are a die hard 'My Neighbour Totoro' movie fan then you must not miss it. So highly recommended by me."" ]"

In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction.

Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing.

Sometime when an experiment goes wrong, it's better to restart from the scratch with a different method.

The Aussie flick has an edge over this when it comes to the challenges faced during the journey and also I loved from narration to photography, music and performance."", """", ""Since they both inspired by the true story, I appreciate the filmmaker's effort to bring them into the screen and salute to those two magnificent ladies.

Without those flashbacks this film was nothing. Literally, this story all about the mental healing. The pain she carried, she just wanted to eject it from her body and mind, and the journey helped it. The funny thing is I liked Laura Dern a lot than anybody in the movie. Her character as well as her dialogues was very inspiring. Her nominee for the actress in a supporting role was justified. I can watch this film again and again, only for her alone, sadly she won't appear for a long stay."", """", ""I loved it, but not completely pleased with the product. The reason is 'Tracks'. I think the film came at the wrong time or maybe I saw this one when the other flick was still hot and fresh in my memory. An achievement is an achievement, I respect both the films.

As a living creature, the conflict within is not an invalid, even non-living substances do have when they come together in the form of chemical reaction. So as we're civilised, it must be minimised.

That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end.

After that, this the second movie of his I am watching and I had two opposite thoughts in the two halves of the movie."", """", ""Initially, I felt I chose a wrong movie. One of the reason was, I could not get the film characters right due to complicated introductions. Too many main characters and that's a too much to recognise if you're not a Korean or not familiar with the Korean faces/actors. Somewhat I was confused, at least in the first quarter. In the second half, especially after the story moved to Korean, I get used to it and afterwards it was very smooth."", """", ""The other reason was obviously the length of the movie. Only because of the puzzled opening order. Later the story development was so good, I began to feel comfortable with the narration and after that I did not notice the runtime at all. I have no source to confirm whether it was based on the real or simply a cinematic fiction, but it was very interesting as it progress. So don't force yourself to watch the movie, but it you do, then give it a time in the beginning and be focused, later definitely you will be in a position to get through as easily as I did."", """", ""\""Damn, we could all die tomorrow.

When everything goes wrong, the story begins to take a turn, complicates further by revealing the old secret. How much it affects and to whom, followed by the final battle sequence."", """", ""Obviously everyone interesting in this film for Jeon Ji-Hyun's presence. Of course, as usual she was very impressive, but her so-star, Ha Jung-Woo with his weird screen name 'Hawaii Pistol' was also equally good. When I first heard Hawaii Pistol is coming, I thought it was the arms supply from Hawaii. Anyway, it was a grand intro, after his entry the movie was set to explore the rest of the story in a style. The other actors like his hilarious partner and the main villain set the tone for the movie."", """", ""Certainly it is a movie to pick if you want an historic subject other than your regular Korean themes. Beautifully written for the screen, except like I said the editing was confusing for the lack of proper inception. Don't think it's simply about the brave freedom fighters; betrayal, revenge, family, third person caught in, like that it had many stuffs. It is also very rare to see a woman fighter among them. All the action scenes were really well made, because that's the title isn't. The terrific settings of the 30s as well. I can't say about it is a must see or not, but surely a fine historic movie that I am pleased with."", """", ""8/10"" ]"

So thanks to the director for this film and I also congratulate him for the Oscars nomination."", """", ""The movie was not complete. As any documentary this one too based on the recorded audio and video clips, and a series of interviews of whom she had worked with and closed ones. It was like a puzzle, but was arranged neatly in the chronological order. You know, you won't get all the truth from them, many stuffs remain mystery.

After all bother of them achieved a lot in the same field and contributed to modernise the computer technology'."", """", ""The reply was like this: 'Bill Gates was from a financially well settled family who was good at studies and his life was very smooth, support was poured from all the corners.

Wherever from you are, this story will look very familiar, you know the master-servant theme with jealous, dominance and other differences between them which intrigued after some unexpected incident. Don't assume it is a revenge flick, but a closer look at the daily life of a servant."", """", ""It is a beautiful drama filled with some occasional dark humours. Frankly, I did not expect it to be this good after I heard it failed to make into the Academy Awards. Yep, this was Brasil's submission for the 2016's Oscars. A story of a live-in housemaid called Val. She opted this life to be apart from her daughter Jessica only to provide a better life for her. But things change, once Jessica decides to come and stay with her mother to apply for a college in Sao Paulo. That brings a complete chaos in the household due to the generation and the professional gap."", """", ""It was a casual opening, like Val was doing her daily routine. This was a very calm part, the story that introduced everything without complicating, especially keeping in mind the second half narration.

That's where this film hits you hard and makes you feel regret if you have ever done anything wrong without knowing."", """", ""It was not like any other similar movies I have seen. There was only a small deviation, that's what it makes a special. Also, it was not completely a realistic boring drama if you're wondering about the pace. It was a steady tempo, but had the sufficient entertaining content, often makes us to guess the next scene and besides it had a tiny twist at the end. It was not a strong ending as one could have wanted, but it's the best one after the story took a turn in the final act."", """", ""I don't know the cast or the crew, but the direction was top notch alongside the cast performances. Thankfully, it was not another sentimental drama with a struggling servant or the questionable relationship between a mother and her daughter. Very much within our perception like you know all this, but seeing it for the first time. The balance between everything was the best of it. Almost 80% of the movie were shot in a single location/house and a few outside clips as the story demanded."", """", ""The Oscars might have rejected it, because there's only five slot and they found better five to fill the spot, but that should not be the reason you to skip this heartwarming movie from the country that hosting the next Olympic games. I feel this film is this year's 'Ida', unlike a nun's self-discovery before taking oath to the god, here a maid realises her mistakes and not being a good mother to her daughter which leads her to fix it by not repeating it. A movie that should be watched with the family, inviting housekeeper for the watch might help bond well.

Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood."", """", ""Communism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one."", """", ""I liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle.

All the above, bringing that 2010's unfortunate mining tragedy on screen was a success, that's the very important."", """", ""It was not a Marvel's superhero movie or a Disney-Pixar's cute animation that has its own large fan base to support. It is not even a Hollywood, but English language movie from Chile. So that's where the critics steered common people in a wrong direction. But as I'm a movie fanatic, I totally recommend it for all. This was not a simple disaster drama, but had a good amount of emotions, suspense, nationalism, light laughs, brotherhood and ultimately a good entertainment."", """", ""It is no ones biopic as it was categorised. It is a single real incident based movie, especially the book 'Deep Down Dark'. All the characters had a fair scope and portrayed according to story growth.

So I am telling you, if you think you know this story, you probably wrong on that assumption."", """", ""If I want to discuss about negative, that would the language of the movie. I am very-very disappointed with that choice, it must have been in the Spanish. Those Chilean characters speaking English was kind of jokes with their funny accent. It did not work for me, because Chile never was a commonwealth member. If Indian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan character speaks English would make sense. I know they wanted it to be an International product, so did they chose Internationally recognisable actors like Antonio Banderas and Julliette Binoche. Yes, on that aspect it paid off well."", """", ""The movie almost got me on its emotional side, I did not show it physically, but surely I felt deep inside me. It also triumphs to tell how important the families are. They are the first ones to react if you are in a real danger to rescue, to shed tears, to standby on the scene looking for your return and to hug tightly. The movie might be categorised in a couple of genres, but it had other mixed ingredients as well. For example, the scenes called the last supper and the circus outside the rescue site. Movies are not all about perfection, sometimes demonstrating its purpose decently would do good enough. So on that facet I got no point to say to skip it."", """", ""9/10"" ]"

The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous.

Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle.

The phase of that life is very crucial, especially for those who had lost their parents and struggling to find their own place in the society. So the learning process comes from their own experience than anybody's guidance. In that perspective, it was a beautiful and a simple family drama that inspires us.

The conclusions were so perfect, reminds us the happy and sad are the parts of our life."", ""Over two hours long film, there's no drag in the narration. The length is because of the three tales and each one was narrated with a pretty good pace.

Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends."", ""The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film."", ""\""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch.\"""", ""The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly."", ""The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible."", ""The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go."", ""Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film."", ""I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it."", ""7.5/10"" ]"

I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent."", ""Watching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'."", ""This is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part."", ""\""Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.\"""", ""Seems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role."", ""First of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment."", ""It's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source."", ""The director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that. In the meantime, I recommend you to check this one out."", ""8/10"" ]"

He's not a friendly type, because of his childhood and the lessons he learnt from his father to face the life as tough it gets."", ""The only friend he ever had did not last for a long. His wife was his world and then the job at the railway. The narration given a good enough focus on his romance life. His younger version, played by another actor reveals particularly the initial stage like how he had met her. I don't know these actors, but they all were so good. A perfect setting as well for the story to take place. I think the filmmakers did lots of best decisions and in the end it all paid off with a greater recognition in the international level."", ""\""Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help.\"""", ""A heartwarming comedy-drama for all age groups. I was looking for such a film and I realised only after watching it. The character Ove was designed awesomely and all the story events built around him was excellent. Covered most of the topics like friendship, love, neighbours, job, moral values, even the pet animals. Loads of fun, guaranteed entertainment if you are seeking a comedy film. As Ove was portrayed very seriously, all his actions, especially the newly arrived woman make major difference to end the film most comedic way."", ""The regularly visiting his wife's grave, the film beautifully gives an insight on the life of Ove being a widower and a retiree. But also how it all turns around for him who never laughs and finally he does, was the film's highlight. Like I always say, I'm not a book person, but I love watching films based on the good books like this one. An awesome adaptation and I hope those who loved the book, as well enjoyed the film."", ""Usually all the good films run nearly or over two hours. Because of the slow and steady developments in its characters and the story. For this film, you won't notice the time. The pace of the narration, including the lovable characters and the storyline makes you forget everything else. In a few days the 89th American Academy Awards nominees will be announced and I am sure it will make. Looks like this year, three Scandinavian films going to make the noise at the Oscars. In the meantime, I hint you not to miss it, either it wins or lose, it is one of the best films of the year around the world."", ""8/10"" ]"

Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew."", """", ""Neel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film.

So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young."", """", ""The CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others.

Many of them were made into films, but I don't remember this one was ever turned into one. This is about a raged gunman on the college campus, where many people got killed and injured. A shocking incident, even cops did not know how to handle it at first."", ""So, the film reveals one of the most horrific episodes ever happened in the American soil. Like everything has a first time, this is where it all began for this kind of event. The filmmakers used some of the original archive footage to tell the story, but the majority of the film was the animation. Since it was a documentary film and was made under a tight budget, the visuals were not that pleasant, but the notion was well achieved."", ""Documentary films and interviews are like thunder and lightening. So there are interviews in it, but most of them were made-up of. I mean they were real, though not with the real people, except their recorded voice interviews in most of the cases. It was challenging to bring back the original event on the screen since it is not a feature film to recreate whatever way they want, especially that occurred half a century ago.

Soon it reached the radio and television, and alert has been circulated. Then the cops got involved to solve the matter and how it all ends covered in the rest of the films."", ""This is a good film, revealed most of the parts as much as in details, but I'm not fully convinced. Because the concept of narration was quite similar to feature film style where they want to keep the mystery. It all begins with one perspective and multiplies as it progresses. Except not focusing enough on the negative character. I understood the situation of the event, but I did not get enough detail about the gunman. It was like one side of the story. So mysterious and it stayed that way."", ""Shorter and well paced. This is definitely worth checking out, though not a must see. To learn the history, the bad one. I had no idea about it prior to watch, but at the end, I felt it accomplished everything on its capacity to give out the truth. No matter it is a documentary film, along with the suspense, the tension was well balanced. So, more or less it is same as like watching a regular crime film.

First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path."", ""It opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period.

Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race.

Since it's always happy at one side and sad on the other, which might discourage the idea of what this film trying to highlight."", ""A teenager who met with an accident in now treated in the hospital. But it is not a good news for his beloved ones. Literally, he's dead, though kept alive by machines. This is not those kind of coma, we have had seen in the films. The parents have to make a quick decision about what the doctors had suggested to them that is to donate the organs to whom needed them most. On the other side of the tale, a middle aged woman with heart trouble has her own opinion about heart transplant. But she needs to be there for her two young sons. In the meantime, with all the developments, the narration heads to the final segment, where tense moments arise till the final scene."", ""?Maybe my time has come. My heart will stop. That's nature.?"", ""I'm surprised that recently I've watched tons of films directed by women. It's really a good sign. Because stories from women's perspective can flourish in the coming generation, similar to the equal rights revolution happed a century ago in the western world. Considering that, it was a bit late to pick up the pace in filmdom. Not all the directresses make romantic or commercial chic films. Take Kathryn Bigelow as an example, she makes lots better men films than many male filmmakers today. This one was a gender neutral films. I've never seen other flicks from this maker, but seems she's young and very potential, that I want her to make a big entry into Hollywood as well."", ""The details in the film were astonishing. I usually not good at bloods. I avoid hospitals till it becomes a must. What I saw in the final quarter of the film was totally something. Like something I watched in a health channel. Of course it was staged, but very realistic presentation or you could say the demonstration was breathtaking. A few weeks ago in one of my reviews I've mentioned a doctor turned director made a film about his former profession. That was a simple rural based drama. The outside struggle. But this one, take us to the deep into the doctors' the other side of the world. I meant the surgery. I have seen many films like this, but none of them were edgy as this one. A perfect ending for such a film too."", ""So, the film might be a bit under-rated, but it was a much better film than many of the recent ones. It might be under-noticed, but that's because of lack of interest in such themed film among common people. Definitely not because of anything defect in the film. The critics have given thumbs up, so do I. But remember that the film has a story, not entirely about what mostly I've mentioned in most of other paragraphs. So expect less from it and be patience for its slow narration. There's nothing like what I've enjoyed you would enjoy it too. Just give it a try, it is totally worth."", ""8/10"" ]"

The story of two women and their unplanned journey to their unfinished businesses. Kind of self-discovery theme, but it gets a little crazy as what the title says. If you know Paolo Virzi and his films, then you know what to expect from it."", ""Well, it begins with when a new member Donatella at a mental institution was fooled by Beatrice, who was there for quite a some time. They might have differences, but have some unfinished affairs outside. An unlikely friendship blooms between them and one weekend, the situation favours them to get away. From there where their journey goes and how it all ends comes in the rest of the narration."", ""They both are not ill or the danger as they were institutionalised. Then why is what the film is going to narrate for us. Before that, it was initiated with a simple introduction of them and the situation they are in. It was really a good start, but then between the end of the first act and the beginning of the second was looked decent. Because that part was very familiar. You know, what do the people do when they runaway which were mostly wandering around and enjoying the freedom."", ""I thought it was a good film, not as I expected. Then, ever since the second half was on the roll, it got a lot better, in fact I started to love it. From a meaningless ride to something sensible topic, the narration comes to the point, what it was holding back in the earlier. Each woman's life revealed before to when this story had commenced. So the trip comes to an end when they do what's better for them and everybody around them. Kind of sad, though it concludes in a right way."", ""\""A mother's love is all giving, never expecting anything in return.\"""", ""The two lead actresses were amazing. Second back to back film for director with Valerina Bruni and she was even better than the previous film. Because the scope of her role was much bigger in this. I don't know I had seen her before, but Micaela Ramazotti was so good, by performance as well as glamorously. There's no way you could part them and say only one of them were good. I loved them both equally. Actually, that's how their characters were developed. The entire film was about them, and they left a mark to remember this film for them."", ""It's a good film, so I don't think it is an Oscar material as the Italian film board had already picked another film for that. But surely it going to win some international awards. If the same film was made in Hollywood, would have considered an average, because this one got the Italian flavour. The film gets crazy, in an Italian style, and in the perspective of the middle aged women. But it can enjoyed by everyone."", ""I have been watching a few good Italian films of the year, including this one. So I would definitely recommend it. Nearly two hours long, but the pace gets better while the story developed. Remember this is not the only kind, but one of the best among this theme you had ever seen. Ending the story with high emotional was so good, especially if you like that kind of material. I hope you won't miss it. Meanwhile, I'm so excited for the director who is making his first direct English language film. Looking forward to its release."", ""8/10"" ]"

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA."", ""The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed."", ""The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!"", ""8/10"" ]"

One of the best original screenplay, I won't be surprised if it wins the Oscars for that. I actually struggled in the opening to catch the storyline. Because the past and present overlapped while sharing the presentation alternatively. But it was about the present with flashbacks popping out regularly to join the tale by comparing/revealing the earlier events. So after few occasions, I got used to it and enjoyed my rest of the watch."", ""I always love good drama films. But not all the drama films I have seen are the masterpiece. So despite it was received so well from all the quarters, I kept my expectations low. The initial parts were okay, but its only during the final stage I begin to like it more. Especially the Casey's performance. I have seen him in many great films, in the big roles, but I think this one is his best, particularly from the positive perspective of the character he had played. Looks like the decade belongs to Affleck brothers. They have given great performances recently and acted in the great films that will be remembered for a long time."", ""This is the story of the Lee, a man who works as a janitor. One day he receives a call that his brother had passed away as he was suffering from the illness for a some time. Since his brother got divorced, all the responsibility comes under his belt, including his teenage son. Now those two struggles to join the force, but somehow manages all. Meanwhile, till the conclusion, the Lee's life before that point were disclosed to us, like how he struggled in his own life before coming to end in the current situation."", ""I could be wrong, but Casey Affleck's going to win the Oscars for his performance. Andrew Garfield is the other guy standing between his chance. I'll be happy whoever wins between them. I like Michelle Williams, but her Oscars nominee is meaningless. What, she appeared for 10-15 minutes in the entire narration which can be tagged as a guest appearance than a full fledged role. This is a fine drama, one of the year's best, deserved all the Oscars nod it got. Surely worth a watch and I recommend it."", ""8/10"" ]"
lion;9;2;LeZee;"[ ""Lost in India, found in Australia!"", ""Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told."", ""Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments."", ""I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'."", ""It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids."", ""Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year."", ""9/10"" ]"

Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story."", ""Like the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up."", ""Excellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed."", ""I did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it."", ""8/10"" ]"

There is a lot of mystery and the movie puts the viewer side by side with the protagonist in trying to figure things out. So if you enjoy taking the film experience similar to a game experience, where you receive cues as the movie goes and part of the fun is in trying to anticipate the branches the story can evolve into, you will have a lot of fun! If you saw Cloverfield back in 2008/9, but did not go beyond the film back them to solve to riddles and easter eggs that came out with the movie, you will have a lot of fun too, but will mostly experience the movie as a stand alone piece as well and have some difficulty connecting dots that link 10CL to the first movie. But don't get me wrong, you will have a lot of fun with it as well! This movie has a great pace, top acting, and it is really successful in making the viewer feel within the whole situation the characters find themselves in. Now, if you are a true cloverfield explorer, you will fall in love with this movie. The thing is, as with Cloverfield, what's going on in 10CL goes beyond what the movie shows. You really have to pay attention to Easter Eggs and the viral marketing campaign to figure out websites where you will find more information about the characters and the broader plot. What's in the movie is just a piece of this bigger plot. I will give a hint for those of you who want to follow this path: search for \""Tagruato\"" and how it connects to cloverfield as a starting point.

This movie delivers extremely well crafted intense action with extravagant (but far from ridiculous) visuals. If it were a concert, it would be like Rammstein. If it were a book, it would be like... well, it would be a three pages book that would require a lot of imagination from the reader... There's only as much character development and plot detailing as necessary."" ]"
the-big-year;10;1;TLHG;"[ ""So this movie is FANTASTIC! But it is not for anyone. People who love traveling to places like Ushuaia or Tasmania, true trekkers. People who love and appreciate nature. And people who appreciate the gist of the movie, which deals with the conflicts of handling dreams, that torturing feeling that you have to accomplish something beyond the ordinary, and the need to stay realistic while dealing with these dreams and feelings. That's a marvelous theme for a movie and the big year is simply an elegant, successful approach to represent it. Not every one will appreciate this movie because it is not a movie meant for every one. But is a very good movie if you have the spirits for it."" ]"

zootopia;10;1;TLHG;"[ ""Clever clever clever clever! This is a masterpiece of its time and an INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR KIDS! While the backbone of the film is a typical, entertaining detective story, its meat is just tons of well delivered pokes on modern society and its most annoying features, particularly real contradictions between minority inclusion ideas that are permeated with prejudice in real world practice (even by those who on paper call themselves progressive and open-minded). This is an extremely well crafted collection of jokes that go deep into our moral wounds! And most importantly, it does not fall into an OVER-SIMPLIFIED IDEALISTIC LIBERAL CLICHE! No, this is much smarter and more complicated than that! And here is an illustration of that (SPOILER AHEAD): at a key stage of the narrative, the predators (who are in fact a minority in terms of population) of this great place called Zootopia (where predator and prey historically learned to coexist) become the targets of prejudice and discrimination by the prey population. First, think... well it seems that predators would tend to be the oppressors and the prey would be the victim, right? Well, but even if that is so (or has been so in the universe of Zootopia generations before the events of the movie), just like we see it in our own world now, there are shades of grey in the definition of who oppresses and who is the victim... Watch it, think about it, and talk about it!"" ]"
in-the-heart-of-the-sea;10;1;TLHG;"[ ""Most unfavorable reviews about this movie (both by users and by professional critics) seem to stand on the fact that the movie was said to be a representation of the actual story that inspired Moby Dick, the book, when the truth is the movie is far from what you will find if you read the original story. In my opinion, if you are not attached to expectations based on Moby Dick or on the actual In The Heart of The Sea book, you will be stunned by the marvelous visual art in the movie (take together everything, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, soundtrack, all impeccable), the solid acting, the intriguing plot, and the involving atmosphere. As the story unfolds, the viewer may feel, at some points, that some reflections that the movie tries to provoke are left hanging and unfinished. However, in the end, when the main plot finds its way, all the little things that were left hanging during the movies become teasers that leave you with a bittersweet sensation of \""I wanted a little more\"". More of what? Well, more whale fight scenes, more conflicts between the men, more storms... I could easily take another 20 minutes of scenes in the ocean with this movie!"" ]"

He's been described as a new Spielberg and that definitely isn't an understatement. When Spielberg is gone we'll have an old JJ to fill his seat in the Oscars. This film caught my interest not from the low budget soon to be critically acclaimed look of it but from the attractiveness of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She certainly deserves to be top tier star but should she be? We would lose that feeling of uniqueness about her and would no longer feel like a well kept secret. And in a way that goes for the future of the franchise as well. The end seems to be going in a direction that could lose the mystery and identity of the best parts of this film. JJ said he has a \""very cool idea\"" in mind for a future title.Should it be a higher budget grandiose direct sequel or something contained and thought-provoking like this? I have to go with the latter. But unless it's something we have not seen before in the Cloverfield Universe, I have doubts that the hypothetical next movie could affect us in such a good way again.

The main draw are the action sequences. Obviously, viewers are limited in terms of feeling like spider man (because, well, it's a movie) but the camera angles give a great sense of swinging like Tarzan across New York City. I especially liked when it would be in a first person perspective. It all gets quite action packed when Spidey fights the big lizard. Spider man climbs atop ceilings, slides, and dashes to evade the destructive force of his opponent.  There's is a lot of walls being smashed.  So unless you must see explosions in action movies (there aren't much) then you'll be satisfied with the fight scenes. Andrew Garfield gives a very good performance (He's the actor who plays Spider Man). It's comical when he  first starts to use his powers.  So all of that's great but there are some bad stuff. Some parts are not original. It's been far to many times when the bomb or device is stopped at the last second. And Gwen only falls for peter because he's a superhero. So occasionally you might feel like you've seen this before. But those complaints aren't significant enough for you to not see it. This is definitely one of my favorite superhero movies."" ]"

I thought Glass Castle would be great, it had Brie in a non-action role,(that always coincides with a really good movie)it's been established that the book was good and it seemed to show engaging moments of what a certain type of movies are really good at showing:exceptional lives that still stay within the bounds of \""I can believe it\"" territory.

manchester-by-the-sea;9;2;Seymour_Movies;"[ ""A moving movie that showcased outstanding performances from Affleck and crew (special note to Hedges) by allowing the actors to show off their ability in painfully long (in a good way) and tense screens. Multiple times throughout the movie, long takes during difficult scenes highlight the amazing acting by everyone involved. Lonergan flawlessly takes you on a journey that keeps you tense and awkward (in a good way) throughout by exploring extremely dark moments that are lighted by sprinkles of witty and often awkward humor."" ]"
maudie;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Having seen Ethan Hawke and Sally Hawkins many times, I expected excellent performances, but it was difficult to stop thinking initially that Hawke was wearing a fat suit and Hawkins’ crippled feet and hands weren’t totally convincing. But the rewards of this film were emotional and not physical. Both Hawke and Hawkins were absolutely convincing emotionally, which is what made the film enjoyable and amazing. They transcended the physical limitations both of the characters and their own fame and made the characters’ personalities completely real and riveting. The story was well directed and didn’t distract from the emotional lives of these two wonderful characters. A beautiful and moving film that I would recommend highly to serious moviegoers who love film."" ]"
the-beguiled;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""This film is not for everyone. It is subtle and requires attention, but if you can give the film that, the experience is very rewarding. I guess you’d have to say it is a typical Sofia Coppola film such as Lost in Translation and The Bling Ring. Another problem is the misleading trailer. What happens to the wounded soldier at the hands of Nicole Kidman is not as sensational as the trailer implies and has nothing directly to do with castration. Within the immediate events of the film, it makes perfect sense, although what is going on underneath is another matter. The cast is wonderful, especially Colin Farrell, Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst. This is a great film, although I am not sure yet if it is a classic, but certainly Coppola deserved her Best Director award at Cannes."" ]"
a-quiet-passion;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""A riveting film that succeeds brilliantly in recreating the life and times of Emily Dickinson and her family – and linking it to her poetry. While creating a film that is both very witty and incredibly sad, the director elaborates on what we know of Dickinson’s life and we feel as if we are living with her family and friends, partly through fact and partly through surmise. Although most of the film takes place in the Dickinson family home, the actors create a larger world (that includes the Civil War) and are totally convincing. If you love Dickinson’s poetry as I do, this is a “must see” film. Cynthia Nixon is astonishing."" ]"
frantz;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Frantz is a highly romantic, mesmerizing film that is beautifully acted and sensitively directed from start to finish. Unlike the 1932 film it is based on (Broken Lullaby by Ernst Lubitsch), Ozon’s film is flawless in its pacing, gorgeous to look at, and agonizing as you wonder how it will all end for the characters you have come to care about so deeply. Although it’s hard to believe that Ozon could make a film as moving as Under the Sand or as sly as The Swimming Pool, he has."" ]"
wonder-woman;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I have never read a Marvel comic, but I enjoyed this film because it was beautifully acted and directed. Who else but skillful actresses like Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright could make Amazons believable, and Gal Gadot is a great find – totally warm, appealing, and convincing as she matured in the film without being distractingly sexual, even in skimpy costumes. Chris Pine was also wonderful as were Danny Huston and David Thewlis. But the real credit must go to the director who kept things moving yet made an interesting film for many different audiences that had plenty of action and spectacle without being empty-hearted or empty-headed. Patty Jenkins’ direction was a real  triumph, although not unexpected from the director of a great film like Monster that deservedly made Charlize Theron a star."" ]"
toni-erdmann;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I think this is a fascinating film, and one of the best things about it is how the audience gradually caught on to what Inez’s estranged (and strange) father was trying to do here – give his daughter a sense of balance and perspective about life. And at the end, she is still not quite convinced, I think, but I don’t want to include any plot spoilers. However, I think he has helped her (and us) make considerable progress toward understanding her/our own worth and desires. I guess its length is a problem for an American audience, but it is a movie like “Magnolia,” where you just have to surrender and “go with it” to enjoy it.  And I have to confess that I’ve sat through a lot of Wagnerian operas, so listening to incomprehensible German and reading subtitles is not such a shock to me. If you try to relax and enjoy it and not be judgmental (like Inez), the action and craziness will carry you along, and I think you will find it rewarding. It’s a movie I will not soon forget, both for its craziness and for its message. I actually might want to see it again!"" ]"
jackie;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Natalie Portman gives an amazing and very moving performance in this film. She does not mimic Jackie Kennedy. She convincingly becomes “Jackie,” illuminates her personality, and leads us all through the horror of the Kennedy assassination yet again and shows us her grief and what we today would call PTSD. But a second aspect is more difficult. Can you really appreciate this film if you didn’t live through the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the period of national mourning afterwards? I found this to be a beautiful, sensitive, and deeply moving film that also gave me a different perspective on American History in both its glory and its violence and also on the human beings who have inhabited the People’s House (the White House) before and after the Kennedy era."" ]"
elle;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""If you love Isabelle Huppert as an actress and can accept other people’s points of view based on what’s happened to them, then you will like or maybe even love this movie as I did. Can rape ever be funny? No, but when you find out who the rapist is in this film – and who his wife is – maybe then you will begin to understand Huppert’s Michele Leblanc and see the many absurdities and ironies in this film. When you meet Michele’s parents and learn about her father, you may understand her cockeyed life more clearly. And you may even find yourself laughing and admiring how Isabelle Huppert manages to make such a character come alive so that you understand and even sympathize with her."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""A harrowing tale of revenge directed by Tom Ford and set in the two worlds he knows best – international art and design and Texas (where he was born). It’s no surprise that he would have a great “eye” as a designer for the look of the film, but his deep feeling for his characters and their situation is. His first film (A Single Man) was more design than substance, but not this time. Jake Gyllenhaal has never been better (I think this may be the best performance of his career, partly because it is so believable, natural, and deeply felt) and Amy Adams does wonders at embodying both Texas and New York. And Laura Linney is astonishing. She is so entirely believable that afterwards you say “Was that really Laura Linney?. If you want to see a movie that will really shake you up and perhaps make you see the world just a little differently, go to this film."" ]"
the-handmaiden;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Sophisticated, daring, and loads of fun, I don’t think this is a film for people who are easily offended and who don’t have a robust sense of humor. A woman “educated” by a creepy uncle joins forces with a woman brought up among criminals – and perhaps together they find true love. Meanwhile their story is told with delicious twists and among fantastically beautiful sets – a feast for the eye and for anyone with a deep sense of irony."" ]"
doctor-strange;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""A fun film with an excellent cast. I had had enough of films based on Marvel comics a long time ago, but I wanted to see three of my favorite actors (Benedict Cumberbatch, Mads Mickelsson, and Tilda Swinton) since I trust them not to make dull movies. I was rewarded with a film I thoroughly enjoyed, even with its crazy philosophy and wild (and occasionally cheesy) special effects. My one criticism was that it got a bit too long after a while, and I kept saying to myself “I thought this film was only two hours.” The Easter egg is also a lot of fun, and even witty! I think this is a film I will watch with great pleasure over and over again – even without 3D, which didn’t seem to me to add all that much."" ]"
kubo-and-the-two-strings;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""What a wonderful film! The animation was astonishing, and the voice acting was simply fantastic, especially Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara, and Ralph Fiennes. Too bad all these wonderful actors can’t get together in an adult film of similar quality. You had to pay attention (or maybe only adults had to since the audience was very quiet, and we had plenty of very small children among us). Well, maybe the script was occasionally a bit muddled, but the characters were so vivid and the animation was so delightful that I have to forgive any faults and give this film a 10, something I don’t do very often."" ]"
45-years;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Charlotte Rampling gives the performance of a lifetime as a woman who finds that she has a rival for her husband’s love whom she never dreamed had such a hold on him until the eve of their 45th wedding anniversary. Her husband has never forgotten his Katcha, and the story of how she re-enters his life and how his reaction shatters what seemed to be a solid relationship is beautifully told. I found this tragic story deeply moving and overwhelmingly sad thanks to Rampling’s wonderful portrayal of a woman whose belief in her husband’s love is shaken to the core and, judging by the last scene at their anniversary party, tragically broken forever. Tom Courtney is also wonderful as the husband with the secret."" ]"
eye-in-the-sky;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""As great an ensemble film as Spotlight, Eye in the Sky delivered what 10 Cloverfield Lane did not – constant suspense that held my interest for almost two hours. The acting was wonderful and often deeply moving, and the only reason I did not give it a perfect score was that I felt there were false notes in both the script and direction. The British were made out to be both people with more conscience but also more bureaucracy (and some might say cowardice) and dithering than the Americans, which I felt was both cliché and unfair. But then it was a British film, plus the movie would have been over in a half hour had the British not passed the buck around so much. True, one American also hesitated, but frankly this also seemed like a contrivance to delay things and to me was not believable. People die unnecessarily when someone in this American’s position hesitates and gets emotional. But regardless of all this, Eye in the Sky is taut and moving, and in its hedging way, tragic. Also the drone and spy technology in the film were fascinating."" ]"
phoenix;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Phoenix is one of the finest films I have seen this year. Although basically a story of love and betrayal, the tension is increased dramatically by setting the story during the holocaust when a wife could be conveniently discarded and exploited if she were Jewish. Nina Hoss was astonishing and flawless, and the direction and story were riveting. I was reminded of Fassbinder, but Petzold creates characters that are less abstract and more believably human."" ]"
carol;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""What a beautifully directed film. Todd Haynes does not put a foot wrong, and he also elicits fantastic performances from all his actors and enormous sympathy for his characters, male and female. This may be Cate Blanchett’s best performance in film, and Roonie Mara was astonishing – and so different from her performance as Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I have a few more films I’d like to see, but right now it is going to be very difficult to replace this film as my best of the year."" ]"
he-never-died;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""He Never Died is a very original film about a very old theme (vampirism). Jack, played brilliantly by Henry Rollins, is reclusive, irritable, and very droll as he tries to stay away from humans, even though they are attracted to him (especially women) because he seems like a very nice, if very sad and introverted, guy. Jack is a “realistic” vampire who is not at all like the aggressive vampires as played by Bela Lugosi, but rather a kind of tragic hero, condemned to his fate of immortality and his need to feed on human blood. He is exasperated, trapped, and weary, trying to do the best he can in a \""difficult\"" situation. Henry Rollins is excellent, as is the direction and script. I thoroughly enjoyed this film."" ]"
spotlight;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Every season there are a few films that remind me that interesting, well-acted, serious films still appear in megaplexes (occasionally). Spotlight is a kind of detective story with some very fine American acting. Liev Schrieber disappears into his role almost completely (this is a compliment) and I am now convinced that Michael Keaton can indeed act and Birdman was no fluke. Also especially fine are Mark Ruffolo and Rachel McAdams. These are intelligent actors, but the director coaxes out of them a higher level of nuance, complexity, and humanity than they have achieved before. You believe them and forget they are actors you’ve seen many dozens of times. It’s a solid script (the quality of the ensemble writing reminded me of Margin Call), and most amazing of all you learn new things about a subject you’ve heard about many time – children abused by Catholic priests. You understand that there was a cockeyed logic behind it all – but, of course, understanding does not make it any less despicable."" ]"
sicario;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I thought the beginning of Sicario was sleep-inducing, but others might consider it tense and suspenseful. However, after about the first half hour, I found the movie riveting. I thought the cast was great, especially Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin, but they played the most exciting characters. Emily Blunt, on the other hand, had the most difficult role as the “pawn in the game,” yet you were always interested in her and what was happening to her even though she was as confused and suspicious about what was going on as the audience was most of the time. To make a character like that sympathetic is a neat trick. The movie also managed a message about the “drug wars” – which was perhaps the neatest trick of all – about why they exist at all and how cruel they are, which puts the movie a cut above most action films where the violence is simply meant to entertain."" ]"
child-44;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I don’t understand why this film got such mediocre reviews. It is beautifully made (ok, it’s a tad long) with wonderful performances from everyone. I was not bored (and I am easily bored), and all this talk about the critics not being able to understand the accents is absurd. Are they playing their earbuds too loud? Or maybe you have to have lived through the years before the Berlin Wall fell (or didn’t sleep through modern history class in college) to understand the Russian society that is faithfully portrayed. It is so sad when such a beautifully made film is so little appreciated."" ]"
clouds-of-sils-maria;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""A haunting film by Olivier Assayas about art, time, and irony. An actress who made her name playing the younger woman in a play about the relationship of two woman (one younger and one older) is asked many years later to play the older woman. She hesitates but finally agrees and then ironically has an even greater success as the older woman. The film follows the actress, played magnificently by Juliette Binoche as she hesitates and then prepares for the new production, and Assayas manages to mix the actress’s feelings with the text of the play so that you never quite know if the actress or her character in the play is speaking. The supporting cast members, especially Kristen Stewart, are also superb."" ]"
it-follows;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""It Follows is a great movie for horror genre fans and also for people who don’t usually go to horror films. Fans can note the homage to Halloween and Carnival of Souls among other films. Everyone should find it constantly inventive and interesting (it will hold your attention) with very personable acting and a convincing nightmare quality. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I hope to see more from this director."" ]"
the-babadook;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""This is a splendid horror film that reminded me of Roman Polanski’s Repulsion in that it was horror based in madness and psychological truth and not in fake scares and other gimmicks. I was also not surprised to learn in the bonus features on the Blu-Ray that the director worked with Lars von Trier early in her career. The ending was inspired -- even playful -- psychologically true and the key to the entire film. Brilliant!"" ]"
big-eyes;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Big Eyes is a lot of fun with the kind of distinctive look that Tim Burton always gives his films, although this time it’s the opposite of dark and Goth. Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances, and the film has a lot to say about the Fifties and how that era affected women’s lives, and what exactly art is."" ]"
the-trip-to-italy;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but the bad news is that you have to pay attention. The jokes and impersonations are hilarious, but they come thick and fast. They identify each person mimicked in passing, but you have to follow carefully. You also should know something about movie history and the Romantic poets (Byron and Shelley in particular), so I can understand that this movie is sadly not for everyone. The scenery is lush, and the food is voluptuous and lovingly filmed to the point where it can make you crazy, especially if you are eating stale popcorn as we were. The film is a lot of fun, but I didn’t give it the highest rating because of the maudlin last half hour where personal family issues and a real family member and a not-very-interesting agent appear in person. The movie fell flat, and since this film is the equivalent of mental calisthenics, it was just a bit too long and the change in tone didn’t really work for me."" ]"
gone-girl;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Gone Girl is a very enjoyable movie. After a slow start, I laughed out loud throughout most of the film. I thought Rosamund Pike was perfect, managing to show us both an inner and outer “Amazing Amy.” Although I felt Ben Affleck did a great job, he was more sympathetic because his back story (his relationship with his mother and so his complete personality) was omitted. Since the author of the novel wrote the screenplay, perhaps she changed her mind. Nick is no better than Amy in the book, but somehow he came out more sympathetic in the movie. They are, after all, the perfect couple – they deserve each other. The rest of the cast was great, and David Fincher came through again (I am a fan). I look forward to buying the DVD and savoring this film over and over. I didn’t initially like “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” but appreciate its artistry and craft more each time I watch it. I expect to enjoy this film many more times too."" ]"
ida;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""A splendid film about subjects done a million times before – coming of age (but this time it’s a young Catholic novice) and the Jewish tragedy of WW2 and its consequences, but in Poland.  Done in black and white (yes, with subtitles), each shot was beautifully framed (I kept thinking of early Polanski), the actresses were riveting, and the audience dead silent and totally engaged. This is a deeply emotional gem with a profound sense of existential mystery."" ]"
snowpiercer;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""As usual, an original, engrossing film from Joon-Ho Bong. It deserves an award just for tricking the audience so completely into believing that they are actually on a train during the entire film. Bong successfully mixes action and philosophy as he creates a possible future world where a global-warming cure has gone terribly wrong and the terrible price paid to save the human race. All the actors were excellent, and you could just enjoy the action – or be constantly surprised by the twists and turns of the ideas in the plot. Wonderful way to spend a hot summer afternoon. PS: Yes, Tilda Swinton can be funny!"" ]"
only-lovers-left-alive;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Best film I have seen this year so far, but not your usual horror movie. Jarmusch’s vampires are relatively satisfied with their lives in their languid way, and you really feel for them – as vampires. Have you ever wondered whatever happened to Adam and Eve and Christopher Marlowe? You can find out in this film. The actors were all completely believable, and the atmosphere of living by night was perfect. The film was also very witty and had great music. I actually felt invigorated after this film and they weren’t selling blood in the lobby."" ]"
transcendence;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I think this was an excellent film. I went for two reasons. The cast was interesting (and didn’t disappoint), and some critics I trust (most of the time) came in late in the review cycle with “green” level reviews. This movie was neither mindless action nor space opera. It had ideas, which were worked out in a coherent way. My friends and I debated these ideas within the context of the film long after the film was over. But even though it had ideas, this was not a boring film. I fall asleep easily at the movies, even when I have had a good night’s sleep, and this movie held my attention on all levels – ideas and story – throughout.  Maybe this film will turn out to be an “Alien” – a movie a lot of critics hated when it debuted (including Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert), but came to consider a classic many years later. I don’t think Transcendence is as great or as original as Alien, but it is a film that should have gotten better reviews than it did and I hope will gain more appreciation in the future."" ]"
the-grand-budapest-hotel;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I gave up on Wes Anderson a few years ago since I thought he had become too self-absorbed and not funny, so this film was a complete surprise. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was constantly inventive, delightful visually, and often laugh-out-loud funny. And the parade of excellent acting was amazing -- everyone had a fun character to play and everyone played his part to the hilt, yet knew just how far to go. Actually I wished some of the actors who made such a great impression in a few seconds had more to do. My only criticism is that I thought the final chase went on too long and the film lagged a bit, and I think it was because Anderson did not quite catch the tone he was looking for, but after such a fun film (for a change), I was willing to forgive him a slight misstep. Ralph Fiennes was wonderful -- could anyone else today play this role with just the right mix of gravity and lightness? The actor who played Zero was wonderful too. Will anyone remember this terrific film next year when the Academy Awards come around? Best comedy I've seen since Mel Brooks' The Producers -- that's how long it's been since I have seen a really good comedy."" ]"
match-point;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""I was watching this film on HBO last night (it is now July 2014) and I like this film even better than when I originally saw it in a theater. What I particularly noticed is its tightness -- things happen quickly and inevitably. I also admired again the performance of Jonathan Rhys-Myers who with his slight sneer and silent watchfulness rivals Joseph Cotten in Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. Is the business about luck contrived? I am not sure, but I wish Allen would do a sequel. I would guess the JR-M character becomes a ruthless CEO (perhaps the Jeremy Irons character in Margin Call) and as he climbs, has a more willing string of mistresses. And perhaps he finds his father-in-law and he are more alike than we originally think or if not, and his father-in-law is indeed weak and rich by chance, the sky is the limit for JR-M -- until his luck runs out, that is. This is one of Allen's best."" ]"
a-most-wanted-man;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""What held my attention during this film was the utterly compelling and completely believable performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman – and I generally have fallen asleep in the middle of recent Le Carre adaptations.  Certainly the film simplifies what I am sure was an even more complex story than in the original book, but I thought the direction was stylish and kept things interesting and moving along. I also thought the entire cast gave fine performances. The audience was silent and for once I didn’t have anybody crawling over me to get a popcorn refill, but then the people around me looked like readers (a smallish theater in a megaplex was almost full). For once, a Le Carre adaptation I thoroughly enjoyed."" ]"
the-imitation-game;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Cumberbatch gives a great and thoroughly believable performance in this film, and is surrounded by an excellent ensemble cast. The film is beautifully judged, and gives both a sense of Turing’s personal genius and tragedy and also his background and milieu by flashing back to his days at school and to the contemporary horrors of the Second World War. The director keeps up the tension throughout. A beautifully made film, and although I have not seen all of the competition, certainly Cumberbatch's performance is Academy-Award-Nomination level."" ]"
love-mercy;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I admired and was moved by this film even though I barely know who The Beach Boys are and don’t particularly care for Brian Wilson’s music. Paul Dano and John Cusack were both wonderful, especially in the way they mirrored each other and became one person, which was almost miraculous. But great as everyone was, I thought Elizabeth Banks was best of all because she always seemed so believable and genuine, even when she was obviously getting involved with someone who had serious problems. Wilson’s luck finally turned with her. The only problem I had was with Paul Giamatti who sadly seemed more “over the top” and cartoonish than the sinister figure he was portraying. Although this film told an old story – about a gifted \""suffering\"" artist – it was not hackneyed but instead fresh and always interesting, even if perhaps a bit too long."" ]"
mr-holmes;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Mr. Holmes is a wonderful film, and I wish I could rate different elements of it individually. Sir Ian McKellen deserves a “10” – he was flawless, deeply moving and I guess the best word is mesmerizing. You knew exactly what Mr. Holmes was thinking and feeling every second. He lived the character, and you believed him completely. Second best was Milo Parker, who, in my opinion, was also completely believable and held your attention whenever he was on screen. He was a great foil and friend for McKellen/Holmes. I was going to say that I was not impressed with Bill Condon’s direction or with the script, but perhaps that’s too harsh – the director and writer were smart enough to get out of the way of the actors. Perhaps my problem is that when I saw the film I was about two-thirds through the original book, which is very interesting and very different in approach from the film, so much so that I think translating the ideas of the book to the screen was very difficult, but the author and screenwriter were successful in doing it. I would give them an “8”. If you are a thoughtful person or someone who loves cinema, this film is more than worth your time."" ]"
goodnight-mommy;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Goodnight Mommy is a true horror movie, where truly horrible things happen, and I am going to do my best not to give anything away. The person I was with caught on early, but I caught on very late (read too many reviews). I think the best way to see this movie is innocently but watchfully, without any preconceptions, and you might catch on more quickly than I did. I am eager to see the film again to find all the “tells” that start right from the beginning and to experience them again. If you don’t catch on, you might just think it is an “arty” European film. It’s not. It’s horror at its best – the horror grounded in reality. Have I said too much?"" ]"
in-the-heart-of-the-sea;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""Although I know I am in the minority, I thoroughly enjoyed In the Heart of the Sea. I loved the very realistic special effects and the excellent acting, and I thought the pacing was perfect. Perhaps I am wrong, but I think this will someday be considered one of Ron Howard’s finest films. You feel like you are really on the ocean and in the boats after the white whale attacks."" ]"
the-forest;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I enjoyed this film, and I don’t understand why it got such terrible reviews. One of my fellow user reviewers was absolutely right (after giving it a 10) – it is “mental scary” and not “horror scary.” What I would say is that it is psychological horror (that is, something like Hitchcock’s Psycho – the horror is Norman’s mind) instead of “place-based” horror such in Insidious. In some great horror films like The Haunting of Hill House, both types of horror appear – one of the characters is deranged but the house is also haunted. In The Forest, I thought the situation was interesting, the actors, especially Natalie Dormer (who seemed to get a good review no matter how much a professional critic hated the film), the locale was fresh and interesting, and the pace and direction was very good. To me the reviews of this film are another example of critics disdaining the horror genre simply because they don’t understand it."" ]"
the-witch;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""The Witch realistically recreates the paranoia that can come of living alone in a forest, separated from the support of a community, when things start to go wrong and spiral out of control. This dark film is both gripping and devastating because you know what is going to happen and can see no way out of its inevitable outcome. You hope for a savior and yet you also know that none is coming. Is it a horror film? Definitely and perhaps more devastating than most because Robert Eggers, the writer and director, takes the type of story we have read and seen many times before and makes it utterly real. It is also an indictment of the type of religious belief that makes people, who are proud, independent, afraid, and starving, show no compassion but think the worst of each other, even their own children. This is a very powerful film that is in many ways an indictment of and explanation for the callous and rigid religious fanaticism that America was founded on. I have only one criticism – in his pursuit of mood and realism, Eggers let the actors slur their words, confusing the audience about what exactly is going on more than necessary. The director only got away with this because we are probably as familiar with the tales of witchcraft in colonial New England as we are with Jack the Ripper."" ]"
a-bigger-splash;10;2;GinaK;"[ ""I loved this film. True, I am a fan of Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, but I was skeptical that Swinton could pull off playing a rock star convincingly and that Fiennes could be frenetic – and dance. Swinton was totally convincing and Fiennes was amazing – he seemed drugged out of his mind through most of the film, but I doubt if you can play someone like that unless you are stone cold sober. The entire cast was excellent, script was great, location was wonderful, and the director did a terrific job of both directing and staying out of the way. I had a great time and look forward to seeing this film again when the Blu Ray becomes available. It’s great fun."" ]"
under-the-shadow;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""Under the Shadow is a chilling film about the horrors of war, the suppression of women under the guise of religion, superstition, and the supernatural. Although occasionally incoherent, the skill of the actors, the director, and the entire film crew is first-rate and comes through. The film works as supernatural horror at the same time as you feel the chaos and fear in everyday life during the Iran-Iraq War as experienced by people like the rest of us and not by presidents and kings. But this is not a political film. It is about human beings caught in a terrible situation where the horrors are many and complex and completely irrational – a wonderful combination of real and imagined horror."" ]"
miss-sloane;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""An excellent film that explores the cutthroat world of lobbyists, but smartly does not take sides on the hot-button issue they are lobbying over in this case (gun control). Jessica Chastain gives a magnificent and thoroughly believable performance as a ruthless woman who will do anything to win in the amoral world she works in and the political “rats” whom the competing lobbying firms work to win over. The films only fault was that it was a little too long and could have used some judicious editing."" ]"

It was way too easy to tell the good guys from the bad and too many similar characters with cookie cutter personalities. Can anyone give one memorable line of dialogue from two hours of blather? Perhaps most egregious was the dumbness of the crew upon landing on the new destination. Few precautions, poor planning, unable to handle emergencies.

It's too bad the movie didn't make better use of Chris' jujitsu skills at least once & it seemed like a big deal was made about the family's racist son/brother but then the character was basically dropped except for a plot device.

The most unrealistic aspect was that the media didn't find Whip as he floundered around at funerals, bars and the crash site. BTW a movie's title doesn't have to be a tell-all. Besides, \""Flight\"" could certainly be metaphorical, too, in this story. I'd have liked a less tidy ending. He could've walked away to face his demons another way, leaving a more ambiguous moral resolution. But it was a good grown up movie without explosions and guns going off every two seconds. You could ask yourself what should he do, what will he do - what would I do? It was really enjoyable not to have a soundtrack that just thumped out what my emotional state was supposed to be all the time, there were several dramatic scenes with no background music at all.

The day after I saw it, I liked it even better & have to give it a pretty high score just for originality and the fact that it doesn't go off the rails (at least not in a bad way, you know, where the concept devolves into some annoying miasma of plot twists & artsy imagery.) Not only does The Voices cover all the aforementioned ground, but the film also provides insight into mental illness & childhood trauma in an entertaining way. Ryan Reynolds & Anna Kendrick wouldn't especially draw me to a movie, but they did a nice job here, especially Reynolds in his turn as a Dexter-esque dude. The topic of women getting stalked & slashed is something I'd typically avoid (hate that fetishy vibe & have seen it too much) -- but somehow this turn manages to embrace that theme in a OK way & give it a fresh take."" ]"

Also, Bullock is neat and clean when she floats out of her suit a la Barbarella  and after the ordeal she'd been through that didn't fly. There'd definitely be an excrement bag to discard. And if you've seen the flick, you know she'd have a ton of bruises, if not broken bones due to the impacts she suffered. At least her shoulder would be thrown out  right?  I think she'd have contusions from head to toe. Her space suit never ripped and no duck (duct) tape was employed.

Too many numbers with just Gosling & Stone -- why not get more background dancers involved especially with the backdrop of jazz clubs? Pool scenes were lost opportunity to do a brief Esther Williams tribute. Neither star has great vocal chops, which is OK, as it makes their characters down to earth -- still, would have enjoyed better skills - kind of thin singing & I got bored with the repetition of the theme song. Also would have been fun to have more fully developed secondary characters -- i.e. Gosling's sister shows up for 30 seconds as a foil to his messed up life but then she just disappears. Stone has all these roommates who could have provided a counterpoint to her experience but who just serve as props.

Director David Robert Mitchell knows how to truly scare you and he does it with pure glee and abandon by keeping you on edge from the get go. The acting from Maika Monroe is great.

Not only are our individual struggles not unique, but they are widespread. Everyone will go through all of those things in their life and while it may feel incredibly important to us in the moment, in the grand scheme of things, it means very little if anything at all. However, this sense of importance is what makes life almost like a play. After thinking about what I thought the film meant, I saw a quote by Shakespeare that essentially said that we are all the lead in our play, which is also something mentioned in the film itself. As depicted in the film with the continuous casting of new actors in the protagonist's play and the growing scope of the set, we all come together and play a role in the play that is life. We all mean something different to every person we come across and play many different roles in our life and embody many different personas."", ""**SPOILERS END**"", """", ""But, what do I know?

I simply cannot describe to you how gorgeous this film is without having you sit down and watch it.

It is hard to put my finger on what makes this series so great, but I think we get a taste of it at the end as even when this film, the final in the trilogy, ended I was left wanting more. Over three hours was simply not enough of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf, etc, for me, which is an amazing thing to say. As for the ending, it is great, though it does go on a tad too long for my liking and is not as great as the rest of the film, but it works and it is pretty satisfying. The Lord of the Rings is one of the rare film franchises that gets better as it goes on, though that is not to say the first two are bad, as they are just as good as this one.

Based on King Lear, Ran depicts the transfer of power from an old Lord to his eldest son, only for him to be subjected to watching his three sons destroy all that he built. A film about chaos of the mind and the world, Ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism. An epic of profound scope, delicately brought to life by Kurosawa, Ran  is a film that immediately becomes one of my personal favorites."", ""Depicting the fall of the House of Ichimonji (fake), Ran is an exercise in trusting and respecting those that you what is on their mind, rather than lie to your face but cover it in complimentary words. In this way, Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. Though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, Hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. As he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when Hidetora died. In many ways, this could be described as Ran's way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). This is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the Ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. However, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, Hidetora merely sped up the demise."", ""Additionally, Ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. Towards the end, when Hidetora's life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son's violence towards one another, he asks \""Is there no justice?\"" Though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, Hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. Throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by Hidetora. We are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to Hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of Hidetora's sons. For Hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you \""reap what you sow\"" and \""violence begets violence\""."", ""Ran also heavily discusses chaos. In fact, its title translates to \""chaos\"". Yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. As he family falls apart, Hidetora goes mad. His mind is very literally chaos. Though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. All of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. Faithful from the beginning, Kyoami (Shinnosuke Ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. The madness of Hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. With bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. Though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and Ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the House of Ichimonji. From plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one."", ""As with many Japanese films, Ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. In particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. With long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, Ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. Though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. Even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. Had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the Ichimonj would not have happened. As such, Ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. Though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error."" ]"

The movie is stranger than it is scary and that really sets the mood throughout the film that something is off about this hotel. Kubrick really does a fantastic job in the director's chair and also plays critic a bit as he toys with the typical horror film techniques. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are also fantastic in the lead role and while this is not my favorite movie ever, it is certainly top ten material. Fantastic film."" ]"

la-la-land;10;1;Spangle;"[ ""Postmodernism is a film theory that suggests that there is nothing original anymore. If it could be made, it has been made and we are doomed to simply remake a once original idea in perpetuity. Postmodernism also includes ideas regarding nostalgia and hyperreality, positing that cities such as Los Angeles may physically be real, but are in fact, dream worlds that are not actually there. In Damien Chazelle's latest work and, dare I say already, his magnum opus, La La Land, this theory takes center stage. Presenting a world of nostalgia of past love, of old Hollywood, and of jazz, La La Land takes place in the hyperreality of Los Angeles. Though undeniably a celebration of the past and showcasing Chazelle's admiration for old school filmmaking, La La Land is also a critique of nostalgia."", ""To critique and subvert rules, however, you must understand them. You must embrace them and then tear them apart at the seams so that may no longer be put together. In the first half of the film, Chazelle does exactly this. With large, kinetic, and detailed choreography and musical scenes, the opening sequence is straight out of 1940s/1950s Hollywood with the golden age of MGM. On the wall of Mia Dolan's (Emma Stone) bedroom is a poster of Ingrid Bergman. Another poster in the common area of her apartment has a movie poster featuring John Lancaster and Ava Gardner. Mia works in the Warner Bros. lot across the street from where Casablanca was shot. She and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) have a first date watching Rebel Without a Cause at an old school moviehouse that uses film. The scene of Mia and her roommates strutting down the road is colorful, bombastic, and embraces the vibrancy of old school musicals. La La Land, right down to the details, is about old Hollywood. Similarly, it is about old school Jazz. Sebastian, a piano player, loves jazz and its history. He dreams of opening a jazz club honoring Charlie Parker in its title and replacing the bastardization of the music he loves with its pure past. With bright spotlights, a deep blue hue to the scene, and gorgeous suits, Sebastian's every look and action embraces the history of jazz. The film lush, jazzy score in these moments and its nostalgic song \""City of Stars\"" embrace this world. Yet, both old Hollywood and old school jazz are merely a mirage now. \""City of Stars\"" - a beautifully written and composed piece of music - is dreamy in its melody. It glides by and paints a gorgeous picture of a world that does not exist. This applies to the elements that celebrated here by Chazelle. They are in the past, though they can still be loved, they are not to be emulated. In creating this world initially though, Chazelle strictly follows postmodernism. He uses Los Angeles' hyperreality to create dream sequences that play out in real life. From Mia and Sebastian tap dancing with a view of the city beneath them or them floating up into the stars in an observatory, Chazelle highlights the city's dream-like state of being. During the entirety of the film, the city has a blue filter over it and the end result is that it feels distant and otherworldly. It never feels attainable and - in the minds of Mia, Sebastian, and the audience - the city exists solely in our dreams. And boy do our couple ever dream. Both have huge dreams and, initially, they encourage one another to follow these dreams. Mia follows her acting dream by writing her own one-woman play. Sebastian joins a band in order to raise funds. However, their obsession with the past tears them down. Mia fails. Her play is a failure and no one attends. Her only hope is a TV show that mixes Dangerous Minds with The OC and bears no resemblance to the old Hollywood style of filmmaking she so adores. Sebastian plays music in a band with a guy he hates as the lead singer and music that betrays the soul of the jazz music he loves. Both have sold out and have careened off course. Why? Because of the nostalgia. They became so infatuated with their love of the past, they tried to live it and become a part of the past. Unfortunately, time travel does not yet exist and this is impossible. Times change and things move forward. If you move to the past, you will be left behind in favor of the future. Here, nostalgia can be a destructive force and serves only to distract one from moving forward and attacking life. For Mia and Sebastian, their love of the past distracted them from their goals and, instead of working towards those goals, their reverse focus led to them walking backwards away from their goals. Their relationship even falls into this nostalgia, as evidenced by the very end. Chazelle breaks up the film into seasons, beginning with winter. Here, Mia and Sebastian are incredibly cold to one another and barely know each other. By spring, things heat up and begin to simmer. In summer, their love is brimming with happiness and joy."" ]"

The monster was my favorite part of the movie, 'Clover' is an original creature design that is sadly being knocked off in a lot of movies today like in the new 'Godzilla' the Female MUTO moves alot like the monster in this movie and even a few years back with 'Super 8' which was also done by JJ Abrams the monster was really just a smaller version of this one.

En definitiva, hay que ver esta película si o sí. Lo tiene todo, es divertida, buena y provoca mucha tensión. No creo que me bañe en unos días JAJA."" ]"
scarface;10;1;daviddelnorte23;"[ ""Llegó el día de 'Scarface' sabía que esta película iba a ser de mis preferidas antes de verla, este sí es mi tipo de cine 100%. Este tipo de personaje y situaciones, en la que se pierde en control de todo y todo es como muy límite. Lo primero, no sé como será la original de Haws, pero quiero verla. Segundo, lo que estaba pensando en todo momento durante las 3 horas de metraje (las cuales son las 3 horas más rápidas viendo una película que recuerdo) lo que podría haber sido esta película si la hubiera hecho un Scosserse o un Peckimpah... Y en cierto modo, si que le voy a dar a De Palma un palito porque hay cosas que hace que no me gustan (pero es su estilo, eso sí). La película es mítica y estas vibrando todo el tiempo con uno de los personajes más icónicos y cafres de la historia del séptimo arte. El final es legendario, aunque ya le había visto, obviamente, por eso me quedo con la escena \""hermana, cuarto de baño\"". En definitiva, ¿Es buena? Por supuesto.¿Es de obligado visionado? Está claro.¿Es una obra maestra del cine? NO, pero a mí me encanta. El ejemplo perfecto es \""El Padrino\"", siendo mucho mejor película que esta, 'Scarface' me gusta más.

13-assassins;10;1;daviddelnorte23;"[ ""Es el remake de \""Grupo Salvaje\"" (una de mis tres películas favoritas de siempre) es lo que decían y el principal (y suficiente) motivo para lanzarme a ver esta obra maestra porque aunque es un remake de otra película japonesa de los años 60', está mas que claro que la obra maestra de Sam Peckimpah es la principal fuente de inspiracion de Miike en este MAGISTRAL film. No voy a esconder el hecho que este tipo de temática en cuanto a misiones suicidas, cosas imposibles de que salgan bien, me encantan. Pero no pintado como en las epopeyas y grandes gestas, sino llevado a lo que es, algo imposible, donde uno mismo elige la manera de morir. La película ya desde el principio tiene momentos impactantes con muchos \""bemoles\"" que rápidamente hacen intuir que esto es otra cosa. El villano es una pasada, una de las personas con menos humanidad que he visto nunca (y eso que la lista es larga). Pero la clave de la película es esa batalla final, una de las más largas que he visto, la cual es una auténtica CARNICERÍA y un baño de sangre, la cámara no rehuye nada y es bastante impactante todo. La relación entre los samurais que ya en días de paz no saben como morir de una manera noble, y se aferran para lo que viven: luchar. Es el motivo más hondo que les hace embarcarse en dicha misión. Por poner algún pero es que al estar concebida por Japoneses, en los nombres y en la materia histórica del relato te puedes perder un poco a veces, si no tienes algunos conocimientos de esta civilización, pero aquí las miradas y los rostros son los que más palabras dicen, ya que cuentan con una gran potencia visual."", ""En conclusión, una de las películas que más me han gustado por derivar, claramente de \""Grupo Salvaje\"" y derivar tan DIGNAMENTE y tan FIELMENTE. Esta película es ya otro nivel y muy superior a lo que estoy viendo últimamente, no le doy un 10 por derivar de otra, aunque se lo merecería. Para mí esta es, ORO PURO."" ]"

Dr. Stephen Strange is initially narcissistic and arrogant; traits similar to other Marvel cinematic heroes like Iron Man. However, Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is subtle and engaging. He is a deeply flawed hero, but an engaging one nonetheless. What I most enjoyed about this film is its attention to Strange's character and his journey to understand more about the world. The effects were also visually interesting and I felt they connected to the themes of spirituality and resourcefulness present in the main character.

With Collateral Beauty there will be no middle ground. It’s like Marmite. There will be people who love it and there will be people who hate it. I love it. It is such a beautiful story.

There aren't any ups and downs and in a way, the story is also quite predictable. Yet, I really loved it. I can see myself pulling Collateral Beauty out every Christmas together with all the other Christmas movies such as Love Actually & Co. Collateral Beauty is a very moving film.

She and Jim lived a long and happy live. They made the best of their circumstances and grew old together. What more could you possibly want from life? Does it really matter where you are as long as you are loved and happy?"", ""I found it fascinating that the entire movie was basically held by only three people, Jenifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen. Jennifer Lawrence is such an amazing actress. Her characters reaction when she found out the truth was spectacular to say the least."", ""Chris Pratt started out as this happy go lucky guy who sank into despair at the prospects ahead of him.

The story moves along swiftly and is filled with action from start to finish. I kind of hope they’ll make another movie one day. I’m sure Lee Child still has got a few stories up his sleeve.

I don’t know if that intentional; I would not think so but what do I know."", ""The very strong supporting cast was lead by Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney. Both were just incredible."", ""As a woman and a wife, I really felt for Laura’s character of Lorraine Sullenberger. Her husband had just been in a place crash. He was far away, both physically and emotionally, and there was no way for her to be there. She had no option to see with her own eyes that he was ok, or to hold him. She had to deal with the sudden hype around his person to an extend she was completely unprepared for. The media parked in front of her house, making such noise that conversations inside were almost impossible."", ""Sully, her husband, was under pressure and fighting his own demons. He was also far away. It is hard to be there for someone if that someone isn’t there. It is also hard to draw strength from someone how isn’t there. She almost lost her husband and the father of her children. She must have been a very strong woman to be able to deal with all of this on her own."", ""Aaron Eckhart plays first officer Jeffrey Skiles, who copiloted the plane. His outrage and disbelief at the way the investigation was handled will resonate in many who are watching the movie."", ""Overall Sully - Miracle on the Hudson is an extraordinary and powerful movie. The courage of the captain and his crew are awe inspiring. It is easy to forget that this is a story about real people.

But I can’t help it. I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I love a musical, and I love the classic style. You can tell me all day long about how Stone is breathy, Gosling looks at his feet when he dances, I don’t care. I liked the way it made me feel, and I left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs. I went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis (which come around every other week). I was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half. A few weeks later, I went in for another show time because I was worried I wasn’t in a stable mental state the first time around. I cried (slightly) less in my second showing, but it still felt as connected. Flat out it was a beautifully shot, exciting, catchy frolic through every young dreamer’s fantasy in LA. 9.8/10"" ]"
get-out;9;1;moviewithmeg;"[ ""The last horror movie I truly enjoyed was probably “Cabin in the Woods”. Recently, I liked “Green Room”, and “Split”, but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya’s rise.  I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as “a scary movie”, you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele’s name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is. Creepy as all hell, and maybe a little too believable. 9.2/10"" ]"

This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn’t being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel’s performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won. The scene at the dinner table could have been his only scene in the movie, and he would have earned that Oscar. That is all. 9.2/10"" ]"

What shines through the most in this film heart, the triumphant glory we normally see reserved for sports films. While Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington pleasantly surprised me, Garfield’s performance really carried the picture. The story builds without dragging, despite the fact that we don’t even get to Okinawa until more than halfway through.

I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I’m also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren’t sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine’s eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10"" ]"

Dev Patel carries an incredibly vibrant performance of the true story of Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child and then attempts to find his family in his 20’s. Pair that with grand sweeping landscapes and the incredibly endearing Sunny Pawar, who shines despite the grit of 1980’s slums of India, and it had everything I could have wanted in a hauntingly true film. This movie stuck with me days after leaving the theater and only deepened the lifelong crush I have been harboring on Dev Patel (which started in Slumdog and escalated in The Newsroom). I am in general pretty lukewarm on Nicole Kidman, but this is her at her best, and her maternal interactions seemed authentic without being romanticized.

It was a classic, I laughed, I cried, I found myself fearing for John Glenn’s life even though I knew how that would work out (history, obviously). I worried the idea of Kevin Costner in ANOTHER “coach” type role would bore me, but it didn’t. I worried that Jim Parson’s only has one tone, and he does.

My sister saw it first and explained it as “It starts as the saddest movie you’ve ever seen, and then halfway through, it sinks into another level of incomprehensible despair.” I am paraphrasing. But she is correct. At every plot turn, Kenneth Lonergan takes the road less travelled and much more depressing. The writing and screenplay work together in perfect emotional harmony, highlighted by the quietly dynamic performances by Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, and one spectacular scene by Michelle Williams that left me crying into a dirty scarf from the bottom of my purse.

The casting is also on point and every actor carries the story and the mannerisms of this kid so well. It´s one of those films that keeps growing on you more and more even after watching and stays days in your mind. Somehow it is not sad, it is quite pleasant and peaceful. It´s life.

So much restraint, so much passion, so much love for their craft, perfect performances, the type of roles that become iconic. People need to see this, it is beyond words.

A crime that he has not been nominated for best actor at the Oscars. Co-lead actor J. K. Simmons is equally great and will win his Oscar for supporting role no doubt. And the film does this with just two main characters, music and a great screenplay. No more is needed when we are talking about real art.

Now, this second part of the new reboot manages to surpass expectations and gets the whole reboot to a new level. It keeps being very emotional and with a lot depth, but also, it gets dark and intense, even brutal in some way. It´s very well thought out and makes you want more after an intense but soft ending. It feels short and you are in the moment it starts thanks to the incredible new world they show us, with apes riding horses and haunting. It´s spectacular and rough.

My favorite story was the boy who was a musical genius, that was the one with more heart and with the best acting in my opinion.

Outstanding body of work, emotive, epic, funny, sad and everything in between. What an experience. One of those very few cases when I strongly disagree with the critics rating.

The performances: all of them so great including the kids. It´s true Russell Crow´s voice is not made for musicals but it was nice to see his different singing style in his scenes.

Great story, great message, amazing characters, iconic moments, probably the best Disney soundtrack ever and several heartbreaking and emotive scenes. The minutes at the beginning when Mufasa talks to his son alone are so full of beauty and depth. Or just the first 5 minutes where we get introduced to the whole experience thanks to the amazing and unforgettable main song beat almost any other animation film in recent years. The Lion King is in the top 20 of most successful films ever adjusting by inflation. Frozen does not even make it to the top 100. That gives you an idea of the phenomenon it was. So deserved."" ]"
the-dark-knight;9;1;sanyrub;"[ ""Best comic book movie ever made to date (2013). The darker and more realistic tone director Nolan gave Batman and this trilogy changed the way mainstream audiences saw super hero movies and made them take them seriously. Terrific plot, action scenes, pace, acting and pretty much everything. There are two things that are worth the special mention: Heath Ledger´s performance and the score by Hans Zimmer. Heath Ledger´s performance is absolutely stunning, scary and memorable. This one and his role in Brokeback Mountain are two of the best performances given by a male actor in the 00s decade. The score is just outstanding, I still listen to it to this day frequently, and the same happens with the final chapter of the trilogy. Hans Zimmer is a genius. Kudos to Nolan, he makes great film after great film."" ]"

Plot holes are some of those things The Dark Knight Rises is full with (as much as I love that film too). There are not any here. There are some absurd actions coming from the characters if you want. But it ends there. Of course people who don´t like to think won´t like this. The 2 hours feel shorter, the idea of the film (humanity origin) is magnificent and so interesting and disturbing. The tension is present throughout the film. Some scenes are memorable. David´s character is so great and the actor does such a great job. And one last thing which helps to make you feel the experience: the special effects are Mind-blowing. One of 2012´s bests if not the best. The oscar nomination in that category is well-deserved. Big production with a brain. Great stuff"" ]"
the-amazing-spider-man-2;9;1;sanyrub;"[ ""The best comic book film since The Dark Knight trilogy brings us an unforgettable experience which can only be described as a roller coaster. Firstly, what I think it´s the most important thing is that the film has a HEART, which is very rare to see in most Marvel movies (thanks Sony and thanks Spider-man). The emotional content is strong and ends giving us a climax that is one of the most impacting scenes in comic book films history, it is truly memorable in fact. The cast has to be the best in a comic book film ever, with Andrew Garfield showing he is the best for this role once more, Emma Stone stealing the show as a very strong female character (Gwen Stacy), Dane Dehaan (probably the best young actor along with Andrew in Hollywood right now) and Shally Field. The chemistry between them is crazy. Then there´s the stunning visuals, the film is so bright and colorful. One of the show stopping moments comes thanks to Electro in Times Square, ridiculously fun. I found the score to be great too (something Marvel movies usually lack). Hans Zimmer is a genius, so no surprise there. In addition to all of this film gives as some closure when it comes to Peter Parker´s parents in a very tense opening scene and later on too. The problem some people seem to have is that there are many things going on, and I understand that argument, but at the same time it did not bother me at all. The film could have been longer and I´d have been fine with it. All in all, amazing blockbuster, go see it guys. I am glad it is being the most successful film of the year so far worldwide."" ]"
the-imitation-game;9;1;sanyrub;"[ ""Wonderful film where no flaws can be found. The screenplay is warm and effective, the score is so beautiful (probably the best of 2014), the story is so important and the message you can extract is so universal and important to mankind. BUT the best part is the epic performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, an emotional but restrained tour de force which reminds me of some of the greatest performances of the last decade (Heath Ledger comes to mind). It is in my opinion the best performance of 2014, over Eddie Redmayne and Michael Keaton. The film is a little bit by the numbers like any biopic is but in this case it all fits wonderfully and the dialogues are very clever, and by the end, the importance of the story being told grabs you and does not let you go. I was ready to give it a very strong 8 out of 10, but I am very surprised at the staying power it is having on me, typical of great films with a lot of depth and layers which become more impacting after letting them sink in your head,  so I have to give it an unexpected 9 out of 100.

Blunt, sold early in the film as a tough-but-moral cop (and her toughness is a hard sell, indeed) makes one bumbling, naive move after another as the chaos of the drug war is revealed to her.  From a plot perspective, ultimately her roll in the drug operation really doesn't make much sense, and it doesn't take much thought to imagine a ton of other FBI better suited to the overarching goals.  Vague, I know, but I can't say more unless you want spoilers."", ""Setting aside Blunt, a side story of a Mexican State police officer who smuggles drugs never really goes anywhere save to humanize some of the low-level traffickers \""just trying to put food on the table\"".  Of course he loves his son.  Of course his wife is worried and prays at dinner.  Of course his son plays soccer.  Lastly, if you like films with military operations, tactics and so on, this isn't your film.  Literally in the first couple minutes, Blunt is on an FBI operation to bust a drug house in full body armor, assault weapons and a troop carrier.  As they're searching the house yelling tactical stuff like \""room clear!\"", Blunt walks into a room without looking(!!), and the cliche bad guy with a shotgun is of course standing right out in the open, and of course is going to shoot it out despite dozens of agents swarming the building.  He manages to miss from five feet away, but ol' quick draw Emily Blunt spins and pumps him full of lead.  He falls to the ground still clutching the shotgun, and Blunt walks right up to him, doesn't neutralize his weapon and then checks his pulse.

This one features a guy in his 70s sailing alone in the Indian Ocean.  It does a fairly good job keeping your interest but the last 45 minutes get tedious and cliche, with the predictable \""almost\"" rescue and the \""all hope is lost\"" scene.  Redford has almost no dialog (doesn't even talk to himself). Likewise, there are no other actors in the film. Critics love these \""actor's studio\""  gimmicks and they explain about 20 points of the meta-score.

Now, before I continue, can I say that the Joker was written and acted PERFECTLY, good job Nolan for writing such brilliant dialogue for the Joker, and Heath Ledger for acting and voicing the dialogue spectacularly. Anyway, The Joker commits a number of serious crimes to get Batman to give himself up. The crimes get more and more horrific, and Batman is getting stressed out.
