wiener-dog;8;4;lennycliff123;"[ ""Wiener Dog is a movie about a dachshund as it passes through several owners, though it's less about the dog itself and more about the people, some grotesque, some pitiable, that inhabit its life."", """", ""Full of memorable characters and lines, it's the movie of the year so far for me. Highly recommended though not for the easily offended."" ]"
the-beguiled;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Visually sumptuous and beautifully understated. Sofia Coppola has directed with assured confidence her best film to date, a remake of the 1971 version starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. The screenplay quietly bristles with sexual subtext and Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning are more than equal to the demands placed upon them by so intelligent a re-imagining, where subtlety is the order of the day. One is left compelled,gripped and exhilarated. Definitely better than the original."" ]"
baby-driver;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Flashy, entertaining, but just a little bit too pleased with itself. To base a whole film around a soundtrack is almost certainly asking for trouble and inevitably Edgar Wright's idea and direction are both a lot better than his screenplay, which on more than a few occasions pushed the bounds of credibility. The cast are firing on all cylinders but the film annoyingly see-saws between good and fair throughout due to some loose writing. Strangely the music choices are often only ok, although credit must be given for them not having been over used in other films. Standout music piece is a track by 'Focus'(taken from Focus Three if I'm not mistaken)to accompany a chase sequence on foot involving 'Baby Driver' Ansel Elgort, who for once is actually good in a role. As befits a crime thriller the editing is sharp and the sound is clear. It must be said that the film definitely leaves an impression after disappearing from the screen. I just wish that the writing could have made that impression more consistent for me to appreciate the resultant movie better."" ]"
free-fire;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A little of this ludicrous 'Reservoir Dogs' wannabe goes a long way. Everything takes place in one location and although there is undeniable attention grabbing action throughout, there is also a certain repetitiveness which begins to pall around the half way point. A game cast do all they can with unoriginal dialogue and there are as many expletives flying around as bullets. The whole thing resolutely refuses to sustain viewer investment, and an air of pointlessness is unable to be dispelled despite snappily impressive editing and a manageable running time."" ]"
the-sense-of-an-ending;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Thoroughly engrossing drama based on a good story by Julian Barnes has some top class British actors giving great characterisations. Jim Broadbent shakes off his usual predictable mannerisms and is actually very good here and the story keeps you guessing right up to the poignant end. It's always good to see Charlotte Rampling on screen and the film also makes very good use of familiar London locations. A small gem of a film which is my favourite of the year so far."" ]"
dheepan;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A Story of three people, victims of war torn Sri-Lanka, adopting each other in order to escape to France only to find themselves in the midst of another kind of war. This richly detailed movie is both culturally and socially interesting, but far too slow to be anything more than moderately entertaining. The climatic orgy of violence (shades of Taxi Driver, anyone?) feels like the film’s raison d’etre and is signposted as coming very early on in the story’s proceedings. The subsequent coda also seems very pat and conventional for a film which is, at its core, presenting a world which is anything but."" ]"

i-am-michael;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Whilst most gay films are often about coming out this unusual offering is about a man who decides to go back in. This problematic premise could so easily have wound up as superficial or patronising taking on as it does an element of the nature vs nurture debate. Questions are posed as to whether sexuality is actually a choice, and despite one's individual beliefs, asks you to seriously consider your answer. Thankfully, due to a screenplay that is interestingly provocative and a performance from James Franco that beautifully walks a tightrope of believability, the film is an unqualified success. Franco plays Michael, a man rejecting his homosexuality after discovering god. Giving a complex and nuanced performance in another fascinating role choice that pushes his own boundaries, Franco is key to the film's credibility. Both the character and the story feel totally authentic which is no small feat given the material. True story or not, in less accomplished hands events played out could have come over as simply glib and contrived."", ""The film also touches on issues of faith. Religion feeds the story and one has to acknowledge that despite the good intentions that are implicit through one's faith, it is also these unbending individual beliefs that are responsible for so many of the world's problems. Whilst the film, thankfully, doesn't delve in to this arena, a rather telling ending certainly suggests that all is not what it seems for Michael and his new found vocation."" ]"
elle;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Isabelle Huppert has never been better than in this wonderfully constructed drama by Paul Verhoeven. Although positioning a rape front and centre, this is no ordinary revenge drama but a well written and directed character driven thriller that keeps you guessing as to the culprit's identity despite a few red herrings being thrown into the mix. It's fair to say that the film is about 10 minutes too long and for those paying close attention the eventual unmasking of the guilty party comes as no big surprise. Compelling and stylish film making non-the less."" ]"
fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""'Don't do anything that's predictable' states Eddie Redmayne's bizarrely named Newt Scamader, a piece of advice that the movie itself was never going to follow. And therein lies the problem with this formulaic, but not unlikeable Potter spin off. The trouble with these franchises or big blockbuster films is that they are all just constantly rehashing old story lines or ideas to the extent that one often knows before viewing exactly what will be on offer. This lack of originality began to pall ages ago for the casual viewer, but as freshness and surprises are no longer considerations maybe even the faithful fan will become bored with all the repetition."", ""Still, I'm sure the plentiful supply of Potter stalwarts will lap it up and, in fairness, it is actually a better film than some of those were. Eddie Redmayne follows up on his Oscar nominated roles in 'The Theory of Everything' and 'The Danish Girl' with a somewhat limp and inattentive performance, or maybe that's just the character he plays. Whichever, he doesn't impress. Far better is the supporting turn of Dan Fogler as prospective Baker Jacob Kowalski who gets unwittingly caught up in the world of magic and fantastic creatures. One scene involving him is actually very moving. The film cannot be faulted at all on its visual effects and Art-Direction. They often take one's breath away and are constantly eye catching. Both crafts go a long way in sustaining interest in a so-so story. Also prominently drawing attention, although not for the same reason, is the rather dark cinematography. Whilst the script's tone is intentionally sombre, dealing with wizards and magic as it does, the 3D visuals of the print under review are frequently so colourless that I had to remove my glasses on more than a few occasions in order to check that this effect was intentional. This aside, however, as franchises go you could do a lot worse than to commit to this initial instalment. As for the promised four sequels, I suppose we'll have to wait and see."" ]"
get-out;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Although suspenseful and nicely paced for the most part, this suffers from having a hurriedly staged finale and a few too many loose ends. One is left wondering just how the black victim will explain the incredible events that he has uncovered. Also the story arc involving the investigating friend lacks credibility and causes suspension of disbelief to just keep mounting. Still, the big reveal when it arrives is a good one and there is a compelling performance by Allison Williams which nurtures the interest."" ]"
king-cobra;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The tongue is not the only thing in the cheek of this entertainingly brisk and breezy look at the gay porn industry. Telling the story of the murder of a porn king at the behest of some disgruntled stars, the film is never as shocking as its subject would suggest but is always entirely watchable. Director Justin Kelly has assembled an unusual choice of actors for this specialised venture many of whom had their heyday in the 80’s and 90’s. Even with all the male flesh on display the real revelation comes in the shape of Christian Slater who is really quite surprising here, especially given his fairly conventional output of the last few years. Aside from Slater, Molly Ringwald turn up looking great.  Ditto Alicia Silverstone who seems a bit off key as the mother of up and coming porn star, very well played by Disney ingénue Garrett Clayton. The star of the show however, although not necessarily the best performance, is James Franco who acts as well as produces. He succeeds once again in further muddying the water with regards to his involvement in these types of unconventional projects."" ]"
moonlight-2016;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A beautifully written story delineating the burgeoning sexuality of Chiron from boy to man told via three different time periods. Beautifully acted by its entire cast and directed with confident restraint by Barry Jenkins. Add to this the gorgeous glow the cinematography exudes and you have a major masterpiece in a minor key. It's every bit as impressive as was 'Brokeback Mountain' eleven years ago."" ]"
nocturnal-animals;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""Fashion designer Tom Ford's new film is a fascinating and intricately complex film that compels from beginning to end. The somewhat shocking and bewildering opening makes way for a thrilling thriller of a screenplay that is rich in detail, hitting more than a few nails on the head with regards to the human condition. Performances of all cast members are good but generally un-showy with the possible exceptions being Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson. To give away any of the story would be to spoil the tantalising grip the film has whilst unfolding. Suffice it to say that the denouement thoroughly delivers on its tantalising promises. Indeed, the ending is great for those who like to think about what they have seen. Reflection enables one to satisfactorily pull together all the strands of this intelligent and rewarding adult drama whilst still leaving room for debate. As expected the film looks great with special mentions for the brilliant editing and beautifully atmospheric music."" ]"
the-girl-on-the-train-2016;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Like last year’s ‘Gone Girl’ this book to film adaptation is less accomplished than its original source. Whereas ‘Gone Girl’ was so reverential to the book it failed due to any lack of surprise in the narrative, The Girl on the train, although less burdened by this issue, is just not as good a story. The film lacks surprises or a distinctive style despite Emily Blunt’s impassioned performance. The screenplay is somewhat muddled in the telling (location shift to New York is the least of the movie’s problems) and some of the lead actors look so alike that further confusion ensues. Ultimately this is a big title that will be forgotten very quickly."" ]"
disorder;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A slow building drama that turns into a riveting thriller due to the unconventional way that director Alice Winocour steers well clear of conventional ‘boo’ moments, but still obtains more than a few jumps anyway. Matthias Schoenaert’s muscular and brooding presence as an ex-soldier suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome is also a huge asset. He seems to fare a lot better in movies when speaking in his native tongue. The screenplay ekes out plenty of interesting detail in the unfolding of his relationship with Diane Kruger’s bored trophy wife, who he has been assigned to protect whilst her husband is away on shady business. The ending offers up a closing moment that for a second has you questioning what you are seeing. Special appreciation must be given to the music and sound design which play a big part in communicating Schoenaert’s medical condition."" ]"
ben-hur;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Comparisons are odious as propagated by those who suffer from such comparisons, and whilst films like this attempt to remake classics from the golden years it is highly likely that the comparison drawn will be unfavourable to the pretender. The original Ben Hur was a record breaking, Oscar laden epic that employed the old school styles of acting, colour and cheesy special effects with such assured confidence that it almost defied criticism. This Ben Hur invites it, even if ultimately it is not as bad as cynical naysayers would have us believe. The original Judah, Charlton Heston, took the whole thing incredibly seriously turning in an Oscar winning performance which cemented his appeal in this type of sword and sandals pic. I’m afraid that Jack Huston’s lack of screen presence and charisma will not be doing the same for him. His Ben Hur, along with the rest of the cast actually, is one dimensional and colourless complimenting, in fact, the surprisingly drab production values. Director Timur Bekmambetov keeps the camera in close for many scenes which has the effect of dissipating any chance of an epic aura. To add to this the actors’ line delivery is often flat and unconvincing. This adds immeasurably to the amateurish feel that the production can’t seem to dispel for much of its running time. Still, two sequences work very well indeed aided no end by some wonderful camera shots, precise editing and impressive special visual effects. Firstly, the chariot race is good enough, and long enough, to stand favourable comparison to the earlier film and the galley slave scenes are also up to par in their excitement value. Not a complete disaster then, but it is another remake that is as misjudged and second rate as it is unnecessary."" ]"
sully;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A disappointing but predictably pedestrian telling of the plane that, due to an unforeseen bird strike on the aircraft, went down in New York's Hudson River. This is a big incident being told in a small time frame for the most part. Therefore, once the birds have done there damage and the plane crash lands there is nowhere much else for the film to go. Sure, we have endless 'what if' reconstructions and the inevitable investigation into the cause of the plane's downing, but this is all filler even if the recreations of the crash are well realised. The investigation by officials into Sully's actions are a bit on the ploddy side, only sparking any interest very occasionally. The scenes with Laura Linney are just impossible. The actress plays the part of the rather selfishly concerned wife in a dreary and tiresome manner. Her scenes add nothing to the drama, but add much to the film's descent into the average. Thankfully, the film is mercifully short."" ]"
bridget-joness-baby;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Renee Zellweger effortlessly reprises her wonderfully kooky character in this belated third film in the series. Although a touch over long, the movie is full of great British actors at their funny best, especially the excellent Emma Thompson. Only to be avoided by those who dislike having a good time."" ]"
florence-foster-jenkins;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The commercial response to art house and Cesar winning French hit Marguerite adds nothing to an already one note joke scenario. Both films have tried to make this true story interesting, but whilst the potential is there it just resolutely refuses to take flight on film. This version although positioned more prominently as a comedy is definitely not the laugh fest hoped for. The problem is that as soon as the singer who can’t sing a note is revealed the film just doesn’t have anywhere further to go as a comedy. Meryl Streep works valiantly in the role and is definitely the film’s saving   grace giving a broad performance that is, by turn, both sad and (occasionally) funny. Simon Helberg is also a very enjoyable as the pianist accompanying Florence who worries about his reputation even as he pockets the generous wage from his less than talented pupil. Like its French counterpart, production values are high with gorgeous Art- Direction and costumes on display. However, the inherently disappointing failure of both films leaves one questioning if we really needed either?"" ]"
summertime;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""This beautiful and subtly nuanced lesbian drama starts so promisingly that the heart races before the head in anticipation of what is to come. Unfortunately, the film relocates from its tranquil country setting to Paris circa 1971 and one starts to fear that it is going to lose its way. Here the closeted Delphine meets feminist and political activist Carol and it’s not long before the two are studying more than politics. These Parisian scenes are by far the weakest in the film and the heavy handed political diatribes and ranting by the feminist group about such topics as abortion are just annoying and alienating. An unforeseen circumstance forces Delphine back to the farm and her mother, Monique, and it isn’t long before Carol joins her there. From here on in the film becomes the one you always wanted it to be, intoxicatingly absorbing. Cecile De France (Carol), bearing an uncanny resemblance to Julia Roberts, and Izia Hegelin (Delphine) slowly get us to care and invest in these characters and as events develop we are treated to some exquisitely realised and, at times, moving scenes (Carol dancing with Delphine’s mother; The train station and the coda circa 1976 are all wonderful moments). As Monique, Delphine’s knowing and watchful mother, Noemie Lvovsky is terrific in support. The film also has some very pretty music on the soundtrack which is a very welcome antidote to the clutch of awful songs that occasionally burst forth, again mainly in the jarring Paris interlude. Due to its subject matter and frequent unashamed nudity this is not a film for everyone. However, others will be surprised by just how immersed they become in this little drama about growing up gay in a small conservative community in the 70’s. Ultimately, this is that rare unambitious film that truly resonates after the credits have rolled and is a most welcome alternative to the dross the summer season has offered thus far."" ]"
jason-bourne;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Aside from Alicia Vikander’s nicely textured performance this is the tried and not so trusted formula as before aimed squarely at audiences who prefer their movies indecipherably action packed, rather than intelligently scripted. If you want action; you got it. You want messy and frenetic editing? you got it. You want global city hopping? you got it. You want a slight, over extended and ludicrous story? you got it. You want fake tension? you got it. You want an insistently pounding score adding nothing to that fake tension? you got it. You want entertainment? Really! Well tough s*** cause you ain’t got it! Copy That!"" ]"
our-kind-of-traitor;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A watchable but unexcitingly bland spy story (no hesitation here in not using the word ‘thriller’) from the pen of John Le Carre that is a rather bloodless affair in every sense of the word. Politely, rather too politely, directed by Susanna White the film is singularly lacking in tension and follows a very predictable and unconvincing story trajectory. The actors do their best to engage the interest and a couple of scenes ignite (in one case literally) but, Tinker Tailor it isn’t!"" ]"
sausage-party;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""On paper this must have seemed like a sure fire hit. A crude and politically incorrect toon about food stuffs misguidedly dreaming of a better life outside of the super market shelves. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired and the bad taste jokes remain just that with the lack of laughs exacerbating the true offensive nature of the material, which possibly has something to offend almost everyone. There is a certain irony to be had from the fact that the film, aimed squarely at the adult market, is more juvenile in concept and writing than ‘Finding’ Dory’ or ‘Zootopia’, both of which are intelligently written, imaginative and truly funny. For most of its running time ‘Sausage Party’ flounders without inspiration in a desperately hysterical manner. A couple of gags raise a grudging smile and there is one very good sequence where the different sausages and veg discover their fates in a suburban kitchen. Other attempts at humour, however, involving a lesbian taco, a Stephen Hawking inspired bubble gum and a Middle Eastern pitta bread all fail miserably. Where the film does succeed though is in underlining the low level of humour to which the whole enterprise aspires."" ]"
cafe-society;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Woody Allen’s films are often either a hit or miss affair. Thankfully, Café Society can be considered a minor hit. In fact it is Allen’s best film since the excellent ‘Blue Jasmine’ three years ago. It can also be considered something of a surprise in many ways. Jesse Eisenberg is really rather good playing a role that Allen would have allocated to himself a couple of decades ago, and a blossoming Kristen Stewart does herself no harm at all in adding this confident performance to her cv. The screenplay is also relatively funny. It may not be an all-out laugh fest, but it certainly encourages one to wear a smile throughout the running time. Visually the film is one of Allen’s most accomplished belying what is probably a fairly modest budget. Vittorio Storaro’s cinematography must be amongst the best of the year in its field. Ditto the gorgeous production design and dazzling costumes. All in all it is definitely a more enjoyable film to watch than you would expect based on the quality of Allen’s recent output."" ]"
hell-or-high-water;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""This lean and masterfully directed screenplay is entirely without a superfluous moment. Rich in detail and brilliantly acted it is one of those rare films that resonates even more on reflection than whilst actually watching it. Ben Foster and Chris Pine convince totally as bank robbing brothers and veteran Jeff Bridges is at his very best as the retiring sheriff determined to catch the pair before he quits. Other supporting characters are deliciously written and outstandingly played by an unknown cast and the whole thing is beautifully shot with New Mexico standing in for Texas. Nick Cave contributes an outstanding score which is reminiscent at times of the Coen brothers ‘Fargo’. This is one hell of a movie that deserves the almost unanimous accolades that have been bestowed upon it."" ]"
de-palma;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""As a card carrying member of the De Palma fan club it is much appreciated to find this an absorbing and fitting tribute to the best director of all time. There are no talking heads here, only the big guy himself tossing out facts or anecdotal tidbits on all his films from A-Z. And indeed the work speaks for itself. Even a lesser De Palma was always better than the best from a journeyman director. His best work, Carrie, is my favourite film of all time, but his other greats include Phantom of the Paradise, Obsession, Dressed to Kill, Blow out and The Untouchables. Another couple of his films would also deserve this accolade – Scarface and Casualties of War. However, their distressingly unflinching content makes them far more difficult to want to revisit. De Palma himself states that most Directors do their best work in their 30’s, 40’s and 50’s and it would certainly seem to be true when assessing his filmography. His later films whilst never less than interesting are nowhere near the quality of his best work. In fact between 1990 and 2016 he has only made one outstanding movie – Carlito’s Way."", ""The 70’s was indeed a great decade for both movies and directors. Spielberg, Coppola and Scorsese were all getting their due. King of them all though was this man, comparatively under appreciated. His imaginative use of the camera, stylisation and fearless audacity are just breath taking. He certainly knows how to produce a ‘set piece’. Hitchcock should, and I’m sure would, have been flattered by his visual tributes. His many critics were arbitrarily dismissive and uncomprehending of his nods to the ‘master of suspense’. Only the legendary Pauline Kael seemed to truly champion him. De Palma can also be proud of the absolutely beautiful music scores that accompany most of his films from composers like Pino Donaggio, Bernard Herrman and Ennio Morricone."", ""Film makers Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow are to be congratulated, not only for the wealth of film clips on offer, but for allowing us to feast on the brilliance that is Brian De Palma. It is, as Films Illustrated said in their review of ‘Carrie’ in 1977, a superb treat."" ]"
the-neon-demon;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Arrogantly, but perhaps not entirely undeserved, Nicolas Winding Refn stamps his initials all over the opening credits of ‘The Neon Demon, a stylish, flawed and intermittently stunning visual experience that hypnotises even as it frustrates. Refn’s achievement is almost totally due to his precise and immaculate framing of each sequence and, indeed, each shot. Aided no end by knockout cinematography it all adds up to a fascinating watch as well as being a superb exercise in visual story telling. Admittedly as well as being enticing it is also baffling and there are more than a few longueurs (Fanning’s end of show cat walk being the most glaring example) that could have been excised along the way. Also the film has a couple of rather nasty and distasteful scenes within its framework, one of which involves a knife and the other a dead body, which will certainly alienate a few viewers. Refn’s direction is really better than the slight story deserves. Whereas ‘Drive’ employed a visual style to compliment the screenplay, ‘The Neon Demon’ demonstrates the exact reverse. It does, however, have a good and all-consuming final word about the fashion industry which does compliment most of what has gone before and is certainly not anti-climatic."", ""Technically the film is outstanding with kudos especially deserved in the area of costumes, make-up and sound. Cliff Martinez again provides yet another all-encompassing and vital score for a Refn film which contributes 100% to the overall impact"" ]"
captain-america-civil-war;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""Due to unforeseen circumstances, aided and abetted by a rainy day, I found myself once again submitting to the very dubious pleasures of Marvel. Admittedly this is a few notches up from previous efforts and, despite a patchy and inconsistent screenplay there is actually a germ of a good story being played out, albeit at monstrously excessive length. The mystery surrounding the deaths of Iron Man’s parents; the brief introduction of additional warriors and a fantastic stunt set piece involving Captain America and a helicopter are all plot points or moments that promise much. Unfortunately, pasting such highlights between endless fights and battles ensure that the story’s flow becomes a stop start affair. These action sequences are not only lengthy and unimaginatively staged, but are also loaded with the usual tiresome banter and unfunny lines which severely disjoint the passably good story and seem to have become a staple ingredient of these films. Technically the achievements are good enough, but it has to be said that the cinematography is very dark for much of the time. Also, the special effects whilst perfectly acceptable are not really showcasing anything new. Fans will, I’m sure, lap it all up. However, even as I contemplate this certainty the one question that keeps wanting to be asked is WHY?"" ]"
maggies-plan;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""The silly season is not lifted one iota by this critically lauded, but extremely overrated comedy- drama.  Comparisons can be made to a bad Woody Allen outing in so much as the film is set in New York and has a very verbose script, but similarities end there. Whereas Allen at his best employs great actors in good stories this verbiage finally adds up to nothing more than pretentious drivel. Despite a good start with early scenes promising an Art house level of sophisticated articulation, it’s not long before the eyes glaze over, the ears tune out and one is left to endure a bunch of uninteresting characters espousing little more than blah, blah, blah. All three leads are not at their best. Greta Gerwig is still Greta who? Julianne Moore continues to lose her edge in yet another downward spiral performance and even Ethan Hawke is the weakest he’s been for years. In fact, it is the supporting turn of Bill Hader that impresses most as Gerwig’s ‘say it as it is’ best friend. Ultimately the film is neither funny nor dramatic enough to make one care about any of these tiresome characters and their predicaments are totally uninvolving. As for the jolly incidental music, this is just another irritating aspect of a small and insignificantly forgettable film."" ]"
ingrid-bergman-in-her-own-words;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A fantastic in depth and insightful documentary about the three times Academy Award winning actress that offers so much more than the usual sketchy A-Z cut and paste biography usually allotted to actors lives. This wonderful warts and all tribute eschews an over indulgence of talking heads and old movie clips in favour of home video and archival film footage. Surprisingly, In fact, clips from Bergman’s movies are kept to a minimum. Her four children provide much of the insight and speak candidly, but lovingly about their career driven mother who nearly always allotted them second place to her desire to work."", ""Whilst viewing one is reminded just how statuesque and radiantly beautiful Bergman was, as in a lot of her films she wasn’t presented that way at all. Her pre-occupation with Joan of Arc is touched upon, and it’s also a real treat to see actresses as different as Sigourney Weaver and Liv Ullman appear together to supply both glowing and humorous anecdotes. Poignancy is added to the whole thing by Michael Nyman’s characteristically moving and identifiable score which, whilst it may be guilty of some manipulation, is still a perfect emotional fit for the tone and images on display."", ""Finally, credit must go to the excellent Alicia Vikander for providing the voice of Bergman in such an impressively unobtrusive manner. A documentary of outstanding quality."" ]"
marguerite;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A rather odd little film that’s kinda funny, but ultimately a very off key one note joke that is desperately over long. Inspired by the character of American soprano Florence Foster Jenkins whose singing was screechy and tunelessly awful, the film is most notable for its gorgeous design and costumes. Catherine Frot is fine, but this is not really a film eliciting much interest in the performances as it is just too ponderous. A promising start degrades into boredom and it is only when Marguerite is coached by an unwilling opera star, who is blackmailed to do so, that the film picks up to reach the heights of a decent dullness."" ]"
the-nice-guys;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""The Nice Guys is a sort of homage to the buddy movies that were a product of the seventies, something akin to ‘Freebie and the Bean’, complete with 70’s background music that almost screams ‘A Quinn Martin production’. Unfortunately, the film is not half as funny as it thinks it is and the plot is undecipherable if your attention wanders even for a moment. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling take their cue from the inflated script and their performances, whilst engaging, are seriously over indulgent. Kim Basinger pops up in a key supporting role to little effect reminding one, fleetingly, of her superior Oscar winning turn in the much better ‘L A Confidential’. Of Angourie Rice playing Gosling’s daughter the less said the better although, to be fair, she is saddled with a lot of ‘adult’ dialogue which comes over as too clever by half when eliciting from her young mouth. The film does have a few impressively amusing sight gags and as a throwaway popcorn movie it is at least watchable. However, despite the blood and violence of its muscular exterior, what we really have here is trivial."" ]"
i-saw-the-light;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""You will know the songs but, like me, you may not know that they originated from Hank Williams. This critically underrated biography of the country singer may be episodic in its presentation, but does a decent job of informing the uninitiated about its subject. Both Tom Hiddlesone and Elisabeth Olsen give good performances, although I have no idea how accurate they are in depicting the real people. Production values are ok, but the cinematography, whilst possibly aiming for a particular period look, is depressingly desaturated of much colour. Still, Hiddlestone has a credible voice and the scenes at the Grand Ole Opry are shot to good advantage. Overall an entertaining effort, but it is still a fair way behind the best Country music biography thus far filmed – ‘Coal miner’s Daughter’."" ]"
green-room;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The credible and the incredible meet to baffling effect in this strangely confused and confusing thriller. Ambiguous plot points and unexplained story elements leave one cold and, for a short film, it sure does out stay its welcome. Even the gore and horror moments are inconsistent and the visual effects make-up looks too unconvincingly rubbery to truly shock. The fact that someone with the type of hand injury as demonstrated here could go from victim to avenging vigilante is demonstrative of just how ludicrous aspects of the story are, and that’s before we start dissecting the paint ball theory. The familiar face of Patrick Stewart further distances credibility. His part called for someone of anonymity in the role and, whilst he is perfectly acceptable, you can’t help but think that it’s Patrick Stewart from the enterprise. The film also fails to thrill as it should and only comes to life momentarily when the victims start to fight back. Even then cast members disappear with a cough and a spit, gorily, but with none of the fanfare of tension that usually prolongs such situations in the best thriller/horror movies. Green Room may have one foot in the real world, but the other is definitely in the realms of fantasy."" ]"
eye-in-the-sky;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Drone warfare and the dilemma of various politicians and military personnel over whether or not to carry out a ‘capture or kill’ operation is the subject of this riveting spring coiled drama. When the targets they are monitoring in a house in a small Nairobi village become an immediate threat to many lives, the debate over the life of one child becomes the focus of the film. The various officials dodge responsibility or ‘pass the buck’ not wishing to be culpable should the collateral damage end up falling at their door. Where the film succeeds so brilliantly is in the writing which offers a balanced presentation of a difficult situation. Political, military and moral considerations weigh in and all facets of human emotion are never far from the surface as depicted by a fine ensemble cast. Even the propaganda machine is assessed. That the film is nail bitingly tense has to be seen to be believed as director Gavin Hood contains the action in a few rooms trusting that his use of close ups on the actors faces will complete the turn of the screw, with just a little help from some judicious editing. Helen Mirren is in her element here. She is always at her best when portraying strong women in control, and her Colonel Katharine Powell can certainly be counted amongst those. In his last screen appearance Alan Rickman has one of the film’s best lines. Rebuking a colleague’s judgemental comments his ‘Never tell a military man the cost of war’ reply, is powerfully delivered. Also, his need to get the right doll for his daughter underlines the pointless trivialities that we all enjoy whilst, generally, remaining detached from the life and death game called war."" ]"
the-wave;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""It is uncharacteristically rare for the disaster genre to be chosen as the main topic for a foreign language film, but it is to the credit of the Wave that the result still oozes all the style and class that the best foreign language films have. The film takes a formulaic scenario, a mountain slide that threatens to cause a tsunami in the Norwegian fjords, but is engagingly played from the get go. Director Roar Uthaug keeps the pace energetic and with the help of some really snappy editing keeps the tension building right through to the somewhat conventional ending. The film is strong in the areas of sound and music and the wave special effects are stunningly realised. Following the Tsunami the cinematography also comes into its own including some tense underwater sequences."" ]"
hail-caesar!;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The most disappointing thing about ‘Hail Caesar!’ is that it had the potential to be a very funny pastiche of Hollywood’s golden age, and indeed the moments involving movie making recreations are sublime indeed. The problem is that the two main threads of the story are just not worthy of the incidental pleasures that the rest of the movie affords. The characters of Eddie Mannix and Baird Whitlock, played by Josh Brolin and George Clooney as a troubled studio head and kidnapped star respectively, are just not given the material to make their characters anything but dull, despite their perfectly respectable efforts. The film is basically too loosely written to gel properly into a satisfactory whole and it is definitely not as funny as it should be. Inspired moments peppered throughout enable a game supporting cast to try and salvage a film that is resolutely skewered to following the boring story arcs of Brolin and Clooney. Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes all register strongly, but it is Channing Tatum and Alden Ehrenreich who steal the show. Tatum is dazzlingly fabulous in his big song and dance number demonstrating a talent I don’t think anyone could have imagined. And as Hobie Doyle, the dumb star of countless westerns making his transition to drama, Ehrenrich presents us with the most enjoyable and fully rounded character in the film. More of him and less of Brolin and Clooney would have been advantageous and most welcome. The film’s biggest laugh out loud moment, though, is reserved for Frances McDormand’s editor, C C Calhoun, whose one scene unwittingly, but deliciously, brings to mind Isadora Duncan. The film is finely crafted in all areas but especially in costume and production design. Their contributions add to the scenes recreating the movie making process which are undoubtedly the highlights of an otherwise very uneven film."" ]"
45-years;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""A small low key drama that is big on impact as it rewards patient attention. The unfolding story takes place over the period of a week when Geoff (Tom Courtenay) and Kate (Charlotte Rampling) are about to hold a party to celebrate their 45 years together. The film slowly involves you in the couple’s relationship which is currently undergoing a testing time due to the arrival of a letter informing Geoff that a frozen body has been discovered in the Swiss Alps. This, believed to be that of his ex- girlfriend killed in a mountaineering accident just before he met Kate, unleashes all kinds of emotional turmoil, especially for Kate, and predictably ramifications ensue."", ""If the story is slight, although commendably very well written, the playing of the two leads is anything but. Tom Courtenay is good as Geoff but his role has to be considered a supporting one when compared to Charlotte Rampling. As Kate, she is at her superb best. In a hypnotically mesmerising turn, arguably her greatest, she displays all the inner turmoil through facial nuances and gestures. She is an absolute knockout here and this is yet another of her latter day performances that shows how maturity and age has really seen her come into her own. She is a fantastically underrated performer. Most actresses never enjoy the success that she has in her 50’s and 60’s. She is that rare example that defies the old adage that there are no good roles for women over 50. Well, her parts just keep getting better and better, as does she. Long gone are those indifferent roles in films like ‘Asylum’ and ‘Caravan to Vaccares’, enjoyable though they were. Director Andrew Haigh employs a similar technique to the one used in his excellent gay drama ‘Weekend’ and his location work in Norfolk is wonderfully refreshing. Most importantly though, having faith in his leading lady he unobtrusively lets Rampling carry the film. This she does with consummate ease."" ]"
10-cloverfield-lane;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Tenuously connected to 2008’s ‘Cloverfield’ but very much its own film, this is a superbly acted thriller which is edge of the seat stuff. A lot of the drama takes place in a bunker that is sheltering three people from an unknown outside terror which, according to the viewpoint of one of the three- Michelle, may not exist. The actors are great and the claustrophobic feel in the bunker is well utilised enabling the suspense and tension to build effectively. In fact, so good are the scenes within the bunker at questioning the motives of John Goodman's character that one almost forgets to consider whether the terror they are hiding from is real or not. Only when the action moves outside does one immediately guess what the truth of the situation is. The score and the terrific sound effectively jangle the nerves throughout contributing to a very impressive feature film debut by director Dan Trachtenberg. The ending leaves some room for a sequel which, in the event, could be as different from this film as this one is from ‘Cloverfield’."" ]"
a-war;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A War is a film of two halves. Both of them good, but it is in the second half when one is drawn into the drama in a more compelling way. Starting in Afghanistan the story revolves around a company of soldiers, led by Claus Pedersen (Pilou Asbaek), who are stationed in an area prone to attacks by the Taliban. During one such incident Pedersen makes a judgement call which result in the deaths of 11 local civilians. He is subsequently taken back to his home country, Denmark, to face trial for what constitutes a war crime. Although familiar from the many other similarly themed films about the conflict, A War is directed with enough verve and skill to make the story seem fresh and interesting. Likewise the court trial, another oft used setting, is actually very compelling and the actors all bring nuances to bear which provides a palpable tension to proceedings. With a few surprises and generally well written characters the arc of the screenplay ultimately impresses, even when dealing with the usually dull scenes of domesticity. Pilou Asbaek is excellent as the commander under scrutiny for trying to do his job under difficult circumstances. It is to the credit of the writing that the trial forces the viewer to ponder the moral and ethical considerations of Pedersen’s actions. In supporting roles Soren Malling as the defence attorney brings his usual strong presence to a small role and Charlotte Munck is very impressive as the lawyer for the prosecution. A War is a small scale film, very well told, about a big subject."" ]"

Critics have been running out of superlatives for this curiosity which whilst it doesn’t bore one, it doesn’t wow either. One watches in a kind of fascinated indifference.

the-finest-hours;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""The shattering of expectation can sometimes shake one out of one’s complacency, especially if that expectation is low. ‘The Finest Hours’ is one such example. Unenthusiastically reviewed by the majority of critics, it turns out to be a finely mounted and gripping disaster drama. Set during a particularly ferocious storm it tells of the rescue mission of a four man crew to reach a stricken oil tanker cut in half by the adverse weather conditions. Whilst the screenplay itself is merely serviceable it does tell a basically good true story, and the production is elevated by a high standard of performance in both the acting and the craft on display. As the hesitant captain of the rescue boat who has thus far never gained the respect of his colleagues, Chris Pine is extremely good. As his girlfriend Holliday Grainger adds a feistiness to her perfunctory role that at least ensures the film is still interesting on land, even if it is the scenes at sea that offer the most excitement. Although underused, Casey Affleck is subtly impressive as the reflective chief engineer aboard the tanker who takes command more by default than design. The film demonstrates an astonishingly good period feel and the visuals in both cinematography and special effects are momentously impressive. Music, editing and sound all contribute to the prestige look and feel of the movie. The biggest compliment that can be paid to the 3D format, and indeed the film itself, is that it is never obtrusive and just becomes part of the engrossing nature of the adventure. This must be an early candidate for the most underrated film of the year as it is both emotionally stirring and spiritually uplifting."" ]"
pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""At first instance one is dismissive of such an unlikely premise of mixing the high literature of Jane Austen with the Z grade antics of zombie land. However, whist not a total success there is definitely much here to commend a film that is at least lively and entertaining. True, the film is happiest when pursuing Austen and ignoring Seth Grahame Smith’s liberty taking best seller, but the film succeeds a lot better than one could imagine. The attractive cast are easy on the eye and the film has a surprisingly up market feel to it, aided no end by some lovely music, costumes and production Design. On the negative side the fight scenes are less engaging than they should be and on occasion down right daft. The Zombies seem to be like puppets on a string attacking the ‘normal’ cast on cue, but ignoring them when the scene so requires. The denouement to the fight scene between Darcy and Wickham is signposted a mile off. Another between Darcy and Elizabeth that comically promises sexual suggestion, a la 1963’s food scene in ‘Tom Jones’, is sadly never realised to its full delicious potential. The visual effects and Zombie make ups are variable in quality. Whilst shots of London and St Paul’s burning are very impressive, the demolition of the bridge fares less well. In a supporting turn Matt Smith scores heavily in the laughs department as the less than tactful Pastor Collins. Overall for mild divertissement it all fits the bill very nicely."" ]"
a-royal-night-out;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A lot better than the tacky misconceived premise promised by the trailer, this is actually quite an accomplished entertainment. The unlikely scenario set on V E day in 1945 has the two princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, enjoying an unsolicited night in the West End. The screenplay is actually quite credibly conceived and executed with a fair amount of humour which is accentuated by the playing of the cast. Sarah Gadon and Bel Powley, as Elizabeth and Margaret respectively, are delightfully convincing and really rather good. Rupert Everett and Emily Watson are also equal to the task of portraying George V and the Queen mother, the girls’ concerned parents. Sporting plummy accents the two effortlessly up the film’s pedigree and humour quotient. Production values are surprisingly high. Buckingham Palace truly looks like the real location from my memories of a visit there and the costumes, make-up, and choice of music representing the period are all outstanding. The cinematography, which mainly takes place at night, is luminous and director Julian Jarrold’s imaginative choice of camera angles elevates the drama from the TV movie look it could otherwise have had. All in all this can be considered a surprising success."" ]"
son-of-saul;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Son of Saul is one of those important films that comes so steeped in the injustices and horrors of its history that one feels positively guilty about saying anything negative about it. This unique perspective on the holocaust atrocities has us following Saul, a Hungarian Jew, working as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz/Birkenau. Here his daily work is to herd hundreds of his fellow race naked into the gas chambers and subsequently remove the bodies, effecting a clean-up of all traces of the horror. After one such routine a young boy is discovered, barely alive, having survived the gas. From this point in, although the boy subsequently dies, Saul becomes obsessed by having him properly buried by a Rabbi. The ambiguity surrounding whether or not the boy is actually Saul’s son casts the actions of the protagonist in a contrasting light, depending on viewer interpretation. It is precisely this unanswered question that causes confusion in the narrative which, in turn, has an overall detrimental impact."", ""The film’s style further distances. Told from Saul’s viewpoint almost totally, one watches intently but real emotional involvement is kept at bay. Long tracking shots, out of focus imagery and an in your face claustrophobic feel becomes somewhat overwhelming. Likewise, the frenetic and dizzying camera movements don’t always allow time to process exactly what is happening. I’m sure this is intentional and in keeping with the chaotic context but, as cinema it is frustratingly unsatisfying."", ""There are two standout sequences, however. The first, where Saul finds himself stripped naked awaiting execution and the second involves an escape."", ""Overall the film cries out to be seen (the critics seem to have been inventing superlatives for it). I just wish that I liked it as much as I appreciate it."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-2;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A fitting conclusion to what has been a very accomplished series. Dark in both look and tone, this entry offers up a few surprises for those who haven’t read the books. Top lined by the current ‘it’ girl, Jennifer Lawrence, who is so good in the role of Katniss Everdeen that it is nigh on impossible to imagine another actress in the part. It has to be said that performances of this stature are not usually on evidence in these kind of commercial blockbusters. It is to her credit that the films have succeeded in no small measure due to her commitment to them."", ""Having said that the film does start with a whimper rather than a bang. However, as soon as our vengeful troop head for the capitol, and specifically the Mansion of Coriolanus Snow, the bangs start in earnest and we find ourselves tensely partaking in the 76th Hunger Games. There is one gob smacking set piece involving a sea of black oil and another nail biting, beautifully photographed episode, down in the sewers where the group come under attack from mutants."", ""Ongoing delights include excellent production design and James Newton Howard’s lovely score. Costumes are toned down from the amazingly wacky designs of earlier instalments and it is left to Elizabeth Banks (this year’s clothes horse for eye catching garb. See her in ‘Love and Mercy’) to carry the day in this area. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman appears too little effect, but no doubt judicious cutting has had to play a part."", ""The film does rather outstays its welcome by tacking on a couple of unnecessary codas that add absolutely nothing. Overall, though, the series has maintained a strong emotional hold throughout. This in itself is quite rare in many franchises being made today, and the movie should be applauded for that alone."" ]"
brooklyn;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""Whilst seeming epic in scope, Brooklyn is actually a rather gentle triangular love story. It deals with a young girl’s emigration from Ireland to New York in order to find a better life for herself circa 1950’s. Soairse Ronan plays the young girl beautifully using her lovely expressionless face to hide all her inner turmoil. It is an amazingly assured and understated performance made all the more impressive by the fact that she is on screen almost constantly. The film itself is like a breath of fresh air. They certainly don’t make them like this anymore but, actually, did they ever? At first glance one isn’t prepared for the astoundingly beautiful look of the film. Instead of the dark and dingy cinematography expected we are treated to brightly lush imagery, and gorgeous costumes in which all the primary colours stand out to stunning effect. The supporting cast add further dimension with great turns from Julie Walters, Brid Brennan and Domnhall Gleeson. Standing out, though, is Emory Cohen as the Italian suitor who pursues her. His exuberance and passion are palpably felt and his scenes with Ronan are hypnotic."", ""This is a movie without a single second of unnecessary imagery or dialogue. As perfect as a film can be. Not only is it the best of the year so far, it is also the most surprising."" ]"

Unhappily married to Harge (Kyle Chandler) she suddenly finds herself attracted to (and then involved with) a much younger shop girl, Therese, exquisitely played by Rooney Mara. Both actresses hold centre stage for two hours and mesmerise throughout. Mara has never been better and understates to perfection, whilst Blanchett once again surpasses her own indelible standards with her aura, elegance and class. She is without equal at the moment, undoubtedly the best actress currently working in films. If she doesn’t nab a third Academy Award for this dream of a performance then the Oscars should finally call it a day."", ""Credit for this gem must also be given to Todd Haynes whose direction is a master class in precision and restraint. He has an uncanny knack for knowing how to get the most from every moment in every scene, and he has an amazing eye for detail. He is complimented in this by the superb screenplay by Phyllis Nagy. Her outstanding writing is full of subtlety and context. To this the actors bring the added nuances that enables them to completely realise these thrillingly flesh and blood characters. Between them they pull off an ending that is cinema heaven, as unexpected as it is wanted. An ending that hits all the right notes to perfection."", ""Past collaborators also bring their skills. Ed Lachman’s cinematography has a deliberately more subdued and grainy look than his lush work on ‘Far From Heaven’, and the colour palette is also far less vibrant. However, it is all in keeping with the period and the unfolding drama. Sandy Powell’s costumes are again gorgeous and her dressing of Mara contributes to the feeling that one is watching a young Audrey Hepburn. Carter Burwell riffs Elmer Bernstein’s astonishingly beautiful score from the earlier film, but his music is lovely in its own right. All other production values are of the highest order, as are the supporting performances of Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson."", ""A fitting and complimentary companion piece to ‘Far From Heaven’, and like that one this is a sublime film. One to see again and again."" ]"
the-hateful-eight;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""The opening credits of ‘The Hateful Eight’ rather egotistically state that this is the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino. Presented in 70mm and complete with an overture and intermission, this can be seen as either a vanity undertaking by its director or as a passion project by someone who loves cinema and the old traditions it stood for. The story outline is a mere strand and it is overblown to epic proportions (a staggering 187 minutes) that it cannot possibly hope to sustain. Things start promisingly enough with Kurt Russell’s bounty hunter escorting Jennifer Jason Leigh’s Daisy, by stagecoach in a raging blizzard, to her date with destiny on the gallows. En-route they meet up with Samuel L Jackson and Walton Goggins before holing up with the rest of the titular number in a cabin which is the home of ‘Minnie’s Haberdashery’. The torturous corkscrewing of the plot plays out from here, but interest is lost after a while due to the overly talky first half. The intermission when it comes is almost a relief. Things pick up considerably after the break and the screenplay introduces flashbacks, narration and a plot twist that livens things up no end. These devices are, in fact, Tarantino’s forte. This second half also lets rip in the blood letting department and anyone who has seen a Tarantino film before will know exactly what to expect. The cast have a lot of fun, with the best performances coming from Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and, especially, an unknown Walton Goggins. The film is technically proficient, although when the actors are competing with both Ennio Morricone’s forceful score and the sound effects of the raging blizzard, much dialogue is lost as a result. The 70 mm presentation is stunning and Robert Richardson’s cinematography of both interiors and exteriors is ravishingly beautiful. It may not be vintage Tarantino, but despite the flaws it somehow manages to stay with you long after you have left the cinema."" ]"
youth;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""This is an offbeat and charming film that resonates due to skillful writing and beautifully sensitive performances from an eclectically inspired cast. Directed with restraint the film is basically, and simply, an observational slice of life set in a Swiss spa where the characters converge and converse to compelling effect. It’s a true original with a possible career best turn from Michael Caine and great support from Rachel Weisz and Harvey Keitel. Only Jane Fonda disappoints, but that’s probably because all the hype surrounding her one scene leads to the inevitable result of expectations being placed too high. The film also has a wonderful Swiss location and great music that is emotively integrated."" ]"
secret-in-their-eyes;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Arriving almost un-noticed under the radar despite starring two high profile actresses, this is actually a very impressive remake of the 2009 Argentinian Oscar winner of the same title. Well written, and a great story to boot, the film is also smartly directed and edited, dealing as it does with two different time frames. People have criticised it for being confusing in this regard, but I had no trouble whatsoever in distinguishing which period was which on screen. The performances add gravitas. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solidly understated as the police investigator returning to his office 13 years later with new evidence about a rape and murder that was never prosecuted. Nicole Kidman isn’t bad either, although the least impressive of the three leads, as the district attorney he shares this new information with. The romantic bond implied between these two is definitely the story’s weakest link. The film’s biggest asset and the real news is that Julia Roberts, once again, proves herself to be more than capable of wowing in something other than a mediocre romantic comedy. Like her great turn in ‘August: Osage County’ she really does impress. Her performances are becoming subtler and more compelling as she matures. The vanity is gone and she doesn’t seem to care how she looks in the process of being true to the character. On the technical side the cinematography is a bit underwhelming, although the music underscores effectively."" ]"

It helps that the screenplay is sporadically funny even if impetus is lost by the end due to over length. The ability of the average viewer, however, to decipher all the plot points and jargon relating to the financial industry is almost guaranteed to restrict its audience.  Of the actors, Steve Carell comes of best and totally redeems himself after his dreadful turn in ‘Freeheld’. Technically the film lacks clear visuals on occasion, but the kaleidoscopic editing style impressively reflects popular culture of the time."" ]"
freeheld;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""Freeheld suffers from a severe belief in its own self- importance. It is one thing to champion a worthy cause, but quite another to make it vital, interesting and entertaining. The screenplay is so intent on making points about gay issues that the over statement causes the film to lose its rhythm. Ultimately it lacks bite and just doesn’t feel cinematic."", ""The performances of Julianne Moore and Ellen Page as the gay couple fighting for their due rights, after Moore develops cancer, are not always convincing. Early scenes of the two becoming acquainted are uncomfortably embarrassing and director Peter Sollett adds to this by including a corny montage showing the two women laughing, dancing and kissing. This device is just a lazy and uninspired way of moving the story forward."", ""Julianne Moore, who is almost the Queen of the controversial or cutting edge subject matter, is seemingly becoming more conventional on the evidence here. After her admittedly superior turn in ‘Still Alice’ she is in grave danger of becoming associated with TV style disease of the week movies. Whilst she does have two or three scenes that are undeniably moving there is a cloying manipulative feel to the emotion evoked. In the latter stages she almost disappears from proceedings only to be wheeled on (literally) at climatic moments with head shaved looking like a large hairless baby. That this evokes laughter rather than sympathy is entirely due to the phony and simplistic writing on display. Ellen Page has a lot less to do and her performance is just vanilla."", ""As for Steve Carell playing a gay activist, this has to be one of the worst most mis-judged performances in a serious movie for years. The performance is both broad and irritating and, contrary to audience reaction where it screened in Toronto, there is absolutely nothing funny in his playing of the way over the top character. He may be having fun but we definitely aren’t. It’s just a peculiar and jarring characterisation."", ""With all these disappointing, ineffective and just plain bad performances on view it is pleasing to report that at least Josh Charles and Michael Shannon deliver. Shannon, in particular, although still having to be a mouthpiece for obvious plot points and (over)statements at least injects some warmth into the worthiness of it all."", ""In the final analysis it’s rather telling when one highlights the end titles song as being the best thing in the film."" ]"
the-new-girlfriend;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Francois Ozon’s best film in years is a delightful and funny comedy drama that plays provocatively with gender. Romain Duris is very engaging as a recently widowed man with a penchant for dressing up as a woman. Following his wife’s death his fetish is accidentally discovered by his late wife’s best friend. Reluctantly, at first, she indulges him and it’s not long before the two are stepping out on shopping trips together, with Duris adopting the name of Virginia for his female self. This simple premise is ripe with potential. Duris, it must be said, makes a rather attractive woman and the story is hugely engaging with some deliciously lip smacking moments that are laugh out loud funny. Accompanied by another perfectly fitting score in an Ozon film, it can also boast an ending that is as surprising as it is great. A real feel good treat."" ]"
truth-2015;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Recalling the more impressive political thrillers of the 70’s, ‘Truth’ will probably fare better with American audiences than others elsewhere. It depicts the fall of several journalistic figures circa 2004 due to a hot potato of a story that aired on the TV programme 60 minutes. Being unfamiliar with the politics and the period concerned, the story comes over as almost insignificant when compared to the career damage its telling inflicted on several individuals, including the show’s producer Mary Mapes and anchor Dan Rather. The screenplay, based on Mapes’ book ‘Truth and Duty’, requires constant concentration and things start slowly. However, as the story breaks and the team responsible find themselves under scrutiny and attack, one becomes more invested in where events are heading. As Mary Mapes, Cate Blanchett offers up another indelible characterisation tapping into new areas of performance. Co-star Robert Redford, however, doesn’t exactly stretch himself as Rather. Of the supporting cast Topher Grace comes off best and he has a really rousing scene in the film’s final act. The score is great and ever present and if the film is not as memorable as past triumphs like ‘All the President’s Men’, ‘Three Days of the Condor’ or ‘The Parallax View’, it has to be remembered that they were positioned more as thrillers. This is a kind of cautionary drama from a different (supposedly more enlightened) era completely."" ]"

This is stultifying and monotonous drama from the pen of Abbi Morgan whose achievements are lessening with every film written. Whilst the subject is undoubtedly an important one it is told in such an unsubtle and plodding manner that one couldn't care less. The production design demonstrates an appropriately dark and bleak existence lived by the women working in the sweatshop. The costumes also perfectly capture the period. However, good production values can only assist a film so far. Even the performances are uneven. Carey Mulligan battles vainly with the material but her impact is less than expected, although a scene with her son does leave one in danger of shedding a tear. Anne Marie Duff is overly passionate. Meryl Streep is hokey and Helena Bonham Carter is,well, Helena Bonham Carter! The film is flatly directed without nuance and the only surprise to be taken away from proceedings is thrown up at the end titles. Here we are shown a list of the year in which different countries gave women the right to vote. Switzerland's late listing is,for a European country, as surprising as it is shameful."" ]"

Therefore, it comes as a bit of a surprise to find that it is actually quite a serious little drama. The story concerns a man (Ben Kingsley) and a woman (Patricia Clarkson) from very different cultures who, in the course of their time together as driving instructor and student, are able to embrace qualities from each other that have hitherto been lacking in their lives. It is a slight and insubstantial film, but there is sufficient originality and quirkiness in both writing and acting to appreciate its existence. It’s also great to see Patricia Clarkson in a rare leading role and she and Kingsley work well together. If ultimately the film falls short due to its limited ambition, it at least deserves recognition for attempting something different, albeit in a minor key."" ]"

What starts out as promising, if somewhat superficial slice of life, begins to fall apart in the last 20 minutes as the repercussions of Minnie’s sexual shenanigans ensures fall out for all the main characters. Taking place in San Francisco circa 1976 the story is centred on a 15 year old teenager, Minnie, embarking on various sexual adventures that lead her on the path to womanhood. Performances are really good with special mention to Kristen Wiig who makes much of her few scenes as the less than perfect mother. As Minnie, Bel Powley (often topless) is convincing as the not particularly attractive teen craving attention which ultimately jolts her into adulthood. Alexander Skarsgaard, also her mother’s boyfriend, is very likeable as the object of her attentions, even though his actions demonstrate weakness and are in reality contemptible to say the least. The film is definitely different, with a reasonable script which possesses more than a few moments that amuse. Sadly, however, the movie just doesn’t deliver on one’s expectation."" ]"
spotlight;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Slow, surprisingly muted and almost overwhelmingly disappointing. This year’s Oscar front runner for best picture deals with The Boston Globe newspaper’s expose of the dirty dealings and hypocrisies of the Catholic Church. More specifically it hones in on the sexual molestation of young boys by Catholic priests. However, despite this controversial hot potato of a subject the film seriously lacks any raw power or urgency. Instead it is content to have its leading investigators amble from meeting to meeting obtaining information rather too easily. Things aren’t helped by the lack of an emotional hook. The victims interviewed are all adults and come across as basic stock characters shouldering all the worst lines of dialogue like ‘Who can say no to god’. Lines like this are so phony that one winces with embarrassment. Anyone who has seen ‘All the President’s Men’ or Netflix’s current ‘Making a Murderer’ will know that films exposing evil or corruption can be nerve jinglingly tense and emotively powerful, but Mark Ruffalo’s annoying depiction of righteous anger just doesn’t cut it. Where the film does succeed is in keeping viewer interest in a subplot as to who in Spotlight’s department was responsible, and therefore complicit, in burying the story years earlier. Performance wise the Oscar nominated turns of both Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams seem quite conventional and uninteresting, whereas the actors in smaller parts; Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and John Slattery all fare much better. The ‘Spotlight’, however, does shine on one person; Michael Keaton. For an actor who is often guilty of being way over the top he is here at his most understated. It is more than fair to say that he single handedly elevates ‘Spotlight’ to a level way above the mediocrity of the rest of the film."" ]"

Based on a true story about one particular expedition that, due to appalling weather conditions, resulted in the loss of lives and the shattering of others. From the beginning the film successfully draws us into the necessary preparation needed to undertake such a massive venture and the pace, though measured, keeps one constantly engaged. Once on the climb things become quite tense. Stunning visuals of the mountain from all sides are sure to give vertigo sufferers reason to look away even if it is these snow swept images that provide the film with its tension. The camera work is truly amazing. Ditto the stunning sound which realistically captures avalanches and swirling winds in all their horrific beauty."", ""An eclectic cast play second fiddle to the elements of nature, but in a very small role Keira Knightley proves once again what an under rated actress she is. Emily Watson is also strong with a great accent and it is about time that Jason Clarke was afforded a leading role like the one he has here. On the mountain, due to the constraints of the clothing, one sometime loses track of who is who. Also certain plot points are a bit vague (what was going on with the oxygen?). Overall, however, the film is surprisingly better than the conventional disaster movie that one had feared would be its template, and is often quite moving."" ]"
sicario;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The problem with Sicario is that it is too much of an infuriating mystery before it becomes anything else. After a stunningly horrific opening the film meanders disappointingly before advancing the story in to any meaningful or understandable context. Dealing as it does with the drug trade between Mexico and the states, the picture is predictably violent requiring constant viewer attention, but is never boring. The screenplay is generally fine, but there are definitely situations that are questionable plot contrivances (Officials fast tracking cars through the border only to have them caught in a traffic jam; The pointless act of obtaining Blunt’s signature to stop her talking, and even Del Toro’s motive for his involvement in the operation). The traffic jam shootout is actually a very good set piece and, whilst the film may take its time for three quarters of its length, there is no denying the power and tension created in the last half an hour. The sound and music add volumes in atmosphere and the performances of the three leads are good."", ""Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro both play unsympathetic characters. Brolin comes over as smug and confidently self-satisfied whilst Del Toro, giving the film’s best performance, is a silent and mysterious character who can turn impassively violent in a heartbeat. Surprisingly, given the early buzz on her role, Emily Blunt’s character turns out to be very reactionary to the males around her. For much of the running time she hasn’t a clue as to what is going on and seems to be there either to be brutalised or ignored, appearing naïve and out of her depth. Considering that this is the type of lead that would normally have gone to a male star it is all the more surprising a let-down. This is definitely not a performance heading for an Oscar nomination despite her excellence at what little is required of her."" ]"
bridge-of-spies;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A good looking, but too stately and ultimately boring cold war espionage story that outstays its welcome by over half its length. Things start promisingly and one could be forgiven for thinking that the quality was going to match that of last year’s brilliant ‘Imitation Game’. Unfortunately, after 60 minutes the attention starts to wander and the not particularly compelling story begins to lose impetus. The acting is reasonably good, although Tom Hanks is nowhere near his best. The cinematography, however, is gorgeous. This is journeyman Spielberg, probably less, and is punctuated with his usual trademark of mushy music. In his good work his scores are integral and accepted despite all their obvious manipulation. In his underwhelming stuff, of which this must definitely be counted, they almost become the final nail in the coffin."" ]"
trash;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Set against the backdrop of the slums of Rio de Janeiro, this unconvincing drama invites comparison with ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ whilst really being quite different. Three kids working amongst the city’s trash find a wallet full of money which puts their lives in danger as this story of corruption, robbery and murder unfolds. Director Stephen Daldry tries hard to keep a handle on a screenplay which is so convoluted that any tension the drama elicits is immediately diluted by unbelievable situations and lack of logical narrative.  Call me cynical but it is difficult to believe that kids from the slums would act in so intelligent and honest a manner. Streetwise yes, but code breakers? Also, the police always seem to know where they are from scene to scene despite Rio being one of the world’s largest cities in which to disappear. Only at a convenient point in the story do they manage to accomplish this feat. These improbabilities and quite a few others take any urgency away from the many chase sequences and, despite some effective editing, the film never rouses as it should. Ultimately, it feels somewhat pleased with itself as a kind of morality tale, albeit a very pedestrian one. The generally upbeat music owes more than a nod to the score of ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ but is in fact just irritating. Also, the parts delineated by Martin Sheen and Rooney Mara could, and should, have been played by anyone. On the plus side there is some lovely cinematography encompassing the less scenic parts of Rio, but in the final analysis whilst not ‘Trash’ exactly, the film is throwaway non-the-less."" ]"

Whilst up a few notches from the lamentable ‘Quantum of Solace’, it’s also noticeably well below the high standard set by Sam Mendes last directorial effort, the fabulous ‘Skyfall’."", ""Things get off to a flying start in Mexico City with a stunning set piece which gets the anticipatory juices flowing. However, it’s all downhill soon after and by the time the movie has hit the sixty minute mark it is in desperate trouble. Daniel Craig seems completely jaded this time out and Lea Seydoux is a weak and anaemic Bond girl. As the baddies Andrew Scott is refreshing, but I really don’t think I can be alone in stifling yawns at yet another villain from Chistoph Waltz’s seemingly limited canon."", ""In addition to the disappointment of the performances one also feels let down by the action. Aside from the opening and closing sequences which are very good, nearly all the other set pieces and stunts feel bland, second rate and unexciting. The whole enterprise just seems tired and even the usually welcome tongue in cheek humour is sadly absent. None of this is helped one iota by an unmanageable 2 and a half hours running time which leaves one anaesthetised by the singular lack of thrills. Even the song (which admittedly grows on you) is not up there with the greats, and one can’t help but recall an apt line from Adele’s 'Skyfall' – ‘This is the end’. Well, amen to that!"" ]"
the-man-from-uncle;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A stylish but rather empty reboot of the classic 60’s series that is entertaining enough to keep one watching but never really excites. The jokey tone is set early and indulged by its two very handsome leading men, but they strangely lack any chemistry. Henry Cavill as the swathe Napoleon Solo tries way too hard as the American art thief and comes off as far too knowing. Armie Hammer fares better as the Russian KGB operative Illya Kuryakin, but is equally lacking in charisma. Ironically the film also stars Hugh Grant who twenty years ago would have made a perfect Napoleon Solo. Here, however, relegated to a less showy, albeit important, supporting role he hardly registers. On the distaff side the currently hot Alicia Vikander is ok, but the best performance to be had comes from ice cool villainess Elizabeth Debicki. The forced humour is occasionally successful in hitting its mark and two scenes in particular stand out. The first has Solo indulging himself in food and wine whilst a speed boat chase is taking place around him and the second involves an electrocution. Both are perfectly timed and genuinely amusing."", ""The film looks great in all production departments; cinematography, Art-Direction and costume design and the location work is stunning. The plot is occasionally indecipherable and full of holes but strangely enough, unlike the latest Mission Impossible outing, the film is never boring. Another asset is the playful score which adds immeasurably to the class of the film and is just fantastic."" ]"

Although this is not as good as any of those classic 70's disaster movies this one still has plenty of excitement and amazingly good special effects, model work and Art-Direction. The story is perfunctory and the occasional risible line of dialogue raises a good natured smile, but the film entertains hugely and the destruction of San Francisco really is a visual spectacle."" ]"
magic-mike-xxl;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Less serious minded than Steven Soderbergh’s box office hit ‘Magic Mike’ this fluffier sequel is also a lot more fun. The loosely structured screenplay at first seems to only offer up a lot of inane macho chatter and the movie never gels into a cohesively good story whilst also fatally lacking an ending of which to speak. However, approached in the right spirit there is much warmth and humour peppered throughout to keep the enjoyment buoyant. Most of the cast are engaging with Joe Manganiello in particular proving more impressive here than he was in the first film. His striptease in the food store is one of the best scenes on offer. Andie MaCdowell is also given a few nuggets with which to shine leading one question where she has been these past years. The film also benefits immeasurably from some surprisingly good rap music on the soundtrack. This in turn elicits a fairly positive response to a movie that, whilst one wouldn’t rush to see it again, is a guilty pleasure whilst it lasts."" ]"
inside-out-2015;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A dazzlingly sublime idea is executed with rare consummate skill. The film takes us inside the head of a young pre- pubescent girl and, more specifically, her emotions; joy, fear, sadness, disgust and anger. In so doing it unlocks a world that one would have been hard pressed to imagine. Although possibly too complex for very young children they will never the less engage with the colourful and likeable characters. Adults, however, will love it and gaze in awe and wonder as a story and screenplay unfolds that exudes intelligence and imagination. Even pathos gets a genuine look in here which is not often the case in animated films where emotions are often overly manipulated and almost forced out of you. The whole thing is just jaw droppingly hypnotic and provides a definite upward swing in animations fortunes where the offerings of the last couple of years have, generally, been pretty dismal."", ""Supporting this little gem is an even smaller one, an approximately seven minute short called ‘Lava’. The story, completely told via a lovely and witty little ballad about a lonely volcano, is just delightful."" ]"
cinderella;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""After the success of last year’s ‘Maleficent’, both commercially and artistically, another fairy tale gets the revisionist treatment although with far less success. This Cinderella lacks any sense of originality, magic or wonder and is a disappointingly prosaic affair. The finger must be pointed fairly and squarely at director Kenneth Brannagh whose direction is by turns both lack lustre and uninspired. Early scenes of Cinderella enjoying time with her father are painfully saccharine and set the tone for the rest of the movie in which composer Patrick Doyle is unfortunately complicit. His cloying score must be one of the worst of his career and never comes close to equalling the brilliant work he has done in collaboration with Brannagh before on films like ‘Much ado about Nothing’."", ""The cast also, in the main, offer limp or insipid characterisations. Lily James and Richard Madden, as Cinderella and the prince respectively, are desperately lacking any chemistry together and it is ultimately left to Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother and, in particular, Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother to keep any interest alive. Eventually even their amusing moments are engulfed by the dull proceedings and the sea of treacle that drowns any initial enthusiasm an audience may have. Ultimately, It is left to the visuals to provide almost all the enjoyment, and in this area the production design excels as do Sandy Powell’s beautiful costumes. These two branches of film making are the true stars of what is otherwise a very safe and ordinary adaptation of a classic fairy tale that deserved a lot better."" ]"

His deterioration is seen as the film progresses and it is truly heart breaking to witness. We are introduced to a family that love and understand him and to audiences who quite rightly revere him as the legend he is. Archive footage fills in a few background details about his life and children, but the only thing really missed here are the perfect renderings of all those wonderful songs.

Sam Claflin and Max Irons play two students who are newly recruited into the said club, which has been a tradition at their school for many years. Claflin quickly has his nose put out of joint when Irons wins an initiation test forced upon them by the existing 8 members, and the seeds are sown for a revenge which turns out to be more potentially damaging than any of the boys could have imagined."", ""Whereas the play more or less just set the scene for the dinner itself where vandalism, violence and the high jinks of a bunch of ‘spoilt brats’ is the order of the day, the film carefully sets up Claflin's jealousy and dislike for his study partner which results in bloody violence. The set piece, the dinner scene, is expertly handled. Director Lone Scherfig places us right in the middle of the group as a participant one moment and then pulls his camera back to allow us to observe with some horror the behaviour of the so called ‘privileged class’."", ""Most of the actors involved are from the original play staged in London’s west end and everyone seems comfortable with their character. Irons plays Miles as a decent guy with a conscience caught up in events that are essentially alien to him, whereas Claflin totally fits in to the spirit of the group. His is undoubtedly the standout performance."", ""The play was undoubtedly very enjoyable and yet any scepticism about what the film could bring to make the material seem fresh proves unwarranted. In fact the story has actually been pulled in to sharper focus giving more context and understanding of the characters motivations and their subsequent actions."" ]"

Marion Cotillard is the film's ace card and she gives a perfectly judged, nuanced performance elevating the slight material to a higher plane than it may have otherwise achieved. Unfortunately, the body of the film is, by the very nature of its content, to repetitive to really excite. Most of the central act shows Cotillard making house calls in an attempt to rally co-workers to her cause. Ultimately, though, these events leave one only mildly interested rather than compelled."" ]"

Juggling with rather too many story strands it fails to maintain focus and the end result is a sprawling mess. The premise promises much dealing as it does with the search for a child serial killer (based on true facts) circa 1954 in Russia, but anyone expecting a movie in the vein of Zodiac or Seven will be really disappointed as this aspect of the film is given short shrift. More time is spent dealing with the power play between MGB officers bent on keeping its citizens under control at all costs. The film has a few standout scenes most of which involve murder or violence and the final confrontation with the child killer is effective at first instance, but is disappointingly played out. Technically the film is just so so. The cinematography is dark and dingy and the music adds little to the mood. The ending is predictable if quite moving, but such calculated manipulation is in no way a reason to forgive or forget the struggle one has endured in the preceding two hours."" ]"

However, the film soon kicks down these seen it all before expectations via fine acting, edge of seat tension and sheer cinematic technique."", ""Fast rising young actor Jack O'Connell plays a soldier who finds his life in danger whilst trapped in enemy territory on the streets of Belfast. His desperate efforts to get himself back to the safety of the barracks becomes the basic story trajectory. From the moment his character is left behind to fend for himself the film becomes an adrenalin rush of heart pounding tension. Brilliant hand held camera movements act like another character one moment and in the next becomes symbiotic of the chaos and craziness of everything taking place. The film is extremely violent and bloody and is edited for maximum effect. The cumulative result leaves one feeling totally drained."", ""In another great performance, which is only a few notches down from the one he gave in 'Starred Up', Jack O'Connell is again completely believable playing yet another man dealing with extraordinary circumstances. Sean Harris, here the face of corruption, is also as good as always."", ""Like the opening scenes the closing ones disappoint as, again, the all too familiar scenarios are predictably played out.

slow-west;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""The slow in the title is the perfect adjective for this arty western about a love struck boy and a bounty hunter who become companions whilst searching for the same girl, although for entirely different reasons. The film’s destination, however, becomes almost irrelevant as the lack of any real dramatic incident leaves one completely indifferent to where events are heading."", ""Despite a manageable running time this journey becomes something of an endurance test that even the talents of Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn can do nothing to enliven. What little back story there is doesn’t answer questions like why the girl is an outlaw; how the boy knew how to find her, and how he got from Scotland to America considering his naiveté and lack of funds. A few moments do manage to stir one to attention and the beautiful New Zealand locations and a haunting score provide some compensation. Also, as the boy, Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a likeable and sympathetic performance.

More than half a century on she is seeking to have returned to her a painting of her aunt Adele, the woman in gold that was seized by the Nazis back in the 30’s. To this end she hires a lawyer, Ryan Reynolds, and the two of them endeavour to retrieve the art work from the Belvedere Palace where it has since resided for around 60 years."", ""Whilst the story is a good one the film projects such a manipulative air of nobility about it that instead of the intended pathos it more often than not causes the rolling of one’s eyes in laughable exasperation. Reynolds is better than he has been given credit for, although not particularly strong. However, his final speech at the arbitration hearing, is well delivered. The best scenes are those that flashback to the past in Austria. These are compelling and hint at another, better film, asking to be made. The coda is unusual and just reinforces the strident effort that has gone in to making this a manipulative tearjerker. On the positive side production values are good and the film is slickly packaged with a cast of notable character actors popping in and out. Of these, however, Elizabeth McGovern makes for an unconvincing judge."" ]"
clouds-of-sils-maria;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""This ‘All About Eve’ wannabe suffers from an excess of talk and is pretentious in the extreme. Lacking ‘Eve’s style, wit and deliciously rendered performances this film irritates more than it entertains. Juliette Binoche plays Maria Enders, a mature actress who is approached to star in a play that launched her career 20 years earlier. This time she has been asked to interpret the older role of a middle aged business woman, a lesbian who is being manipulated by her young female assistant. In reality, her own assistant played by Kirsten Stewart coaxes her into playing the role. Thus the heart of the film becomes about the two actresses sparring with each other as Binoche tries to come to grips with a role with which she is unable to identify. As these discussions and the subsequent confrontations change their working dynamic the line between the play and reality becomes blurred. As a story outline it all sounds very promising and the actresses, particularly Stewart, give it their best shot. However, they are ultimately let down by the material which disintegrates badly in the mid- section as the two women disagree over aspects of the play and characters. Lovers of pretension will surely run out of superlatives for all the mumbo jumbo spouted. Others, myself included, will merely disengage and lose interest. Surprisingly the film actually rallies a little when Stewart disappears from the scene. This is in not a reflection on her performance, which is probably the best in the film, but it gives a little more mystery and anticipation as to where the drama is going. Unfortunately, a rather ambiguous parting moment is also the final nail in the coffin for a film that never fully gets you on its side."" ]"
the-divergent-series-insurgent;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A rather padded and meandering second instalment for the Divergent series that is definitely not as good as the first film. The problem in the main is that the earlier movie was more interesting as it was setting up the scenario. This one just becomes a kind of futuristic chase movie that is far too long. Plot points often lack clarity and whilst the film is eminently watchable the middle section drags noticeably. Shailene Woodley is a major asset as well as being a great little actress into the bargain. She out acts everyone else on screen even if Kate Winslet and Miles Teller have their moments. To get the most from proceedings it is advisable to have seen the earlier film if just for context. Naomi Watts is introduced here as a potential baddie but she doesn't really come into her own here. However, if the rather good ending is anything to go by, we can look forward to seeing a lot more of her next time when hopefully this film's failings are sorted out and improved upon. Finally, the special effects aren't bad, but there isn't really anything here that hasn't been seen before."" ]"
it-follows;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Even though it is not quite as scary as word of mouth would have us believe this is still a superb psychological thriller rather than an out and out horror movie. Low on bloody gore but high on atmosphere, most of which is wonderfully generated by simple shots such as roads, trees a gate or a swimming pool. These and many other ordinary compositions have been lit and captured in a way that gives the film its eerie sense of menace and dread. In the main the film owes its success to these simple details masterfully directed by David Robert Mitchell. Maika Monroe, looking very much like Chloe Sevigny, registers strongly as the young victim of events, and the nerve jangling score is another great contributor. It is also good to be able to report that the film does not rely on gimmicky shock tactics to raise the hairs on your neck. In fact, there are surprisingly few jumps to be had. Still, this doesn't prevent the film from holding you mesmerised in the palm of its hand for almost its entire running time or, at least, until an unsatisfactory ending somewhat disappoints."" ]"
still-alice;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Handicapped by an inauspicious trailer which affords it the injustice of looking like a disease of the week TV movie, this is actually a small but surprisingly well-wrought drama. Oscar winner Julianne Moore gives an affectingly subtle performance as a 50 year old woman suffering the onslaught of Alzheimer’s. Through the course of the running time she manages to convey the effects of this terrible disease without resorting to histrionics or mawkishness. Her rapid deterioration is utterly believable and the screenplay manages to avoid the obvious clichés that this kind of movie can be prone to."", ""As her daughter, Lydia, Kristen Stewart does a great job of holding her own when on screen with Moore. The film successfully paints the picture of a fractious relationship between mother and daughter which only begins to repair due to the unforeseen and tragic circumstances.

mr-turner;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Opening inauspiciously, Mr. Turner threatens to give credence to the phrase ‘worthy but dull’. As the film goes on, though, it slowly draws you in to the richness of its characters and period. Leisurely paced, beautifully designed and, as with all Mike Leigh’s best films, elevated by some wonderful performances from many of his regular collaborators. Timothy Spall plays the famed painter in the last years of his life as an unsympathetic crude man and is totally believable grunting and scowling his way through the film. Nevertheless, he is all but eclipsed by two women in the cast. Dorothy Atkinson is outstanding as his doting housekeeper, and Marion Bailey is equally fine as the woman who became his last mistress. He meets her during one of his stays at her lodgings in Margate, the town of inspiration for much of his greatest work."", ""Throughout its 150 minutes, director Mike Leigh pays exquisite attention to detail and the look of the film is so precise that you can almost smell and feel the period. The costumes are beautiful renditions of the time but have an authentic lived in look, and the hair and make- up is also of a high standard. Only the music disappoints as it is far to glum and depressing. Admittedly the film is not a barrel of laughs, but there is enough occasional humour peppered within the screenplay to have afforded a less melancholic score from composer Gary Yershon."" ]"
mommy;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""An exhilaratingly original, exciting and audacious work from director Xavier Dolan that holds one spellbound for every one of its 139 minutes. Despite subject matter that could have been either downbeat or depressing the film manages to project both hope and humour in its telling of the relationships between three damaged individuals. Dolan’s skill as a visionary director is on display constantly and his bravura use of the camera is imaginative. This includes the unusual decision to film in the 1:1 ratio as if to reflect the restricted lives under the spotlight. Simple shots and a blend of techniques are equally breath taking to behold and have maximum impact within the context of both the scene and the story as a whole. Dolan is also very well served by his three principle actors who deliver sublimely knock out performances. Anne Dorval as the thick skinned but tackily dressed mother of a violent and uncontrollable son, is a gutsy and loud presence that can’t be ignored. Suzanne Clement, on the other hand, subtly shows us the layers of a withdrawn wife and mother who’s stuttering only begins to subside when around these two larger than life individuals. As the son, Antoine Olivier Pilon is one moment tender and loving and in the next dangerously out of control. All three performances are outstanding and complement each other beautifully."", ""Technically the film is also great. The editing is seamless and impressively clever.

The main problem is with the story itself which just doesn't cut it when compared to some amazing scenes of slapstick timed to absolute perfection."", """", ""Paddington himself is wonderfully realised and uncannily voiced by Ben Whishaw. Let's face it, it's the bear we have come to see and he doesn't disappoint. Scene after scene ignites. The bathroom and cello tape sequences in particular are great fun. Also, there are magical moments involving a dolls house and a miniature railway carriage. In fact, there is so much to enjoy that it is rather a shame that the linking narrative and Paddington's human counterparts start to drag the film down. Ultimately, one is forced to acknowledge the film's unfortunate schizophrenia. Funny and moving it maybe, but sadly it's also rather yawny."" ]"
cake;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Despite an un-prepossessing title Cake is an absorbing and surprisingly moving little film that in the main eschews obvious sentiment and cliché. It tells the story of Claire Bennett, a young woman suffering from chronic back pain following a car accident that also killed her young son. The film affords an actress ample opportunity to knock it out of the park and comedy queen Jennifer Aniston is certainly up to the task. She portrays Claire as both angry and unlikeable, but still manages to elicit empathy for her plight. The screenplay doesn’t lay all its cards on the table from the outset so one is always alert to what this woman’s back story is. The revelation when it comes is not really a big surprise as such, but the drip feeding of information certainly keeps one watching. Supporting characters are well delineated even if the scenes with Sam Worthington are probably the most conventional. Ultimately, though, this is a film that is totally reliant on the credibility brought to the table by its lead actress and Aniston is devastatingly good. Her scenes with Adriana Barraza in particular are especially captivating. Underrated as an actress Aniston is not only one of the best comedienne’s working in films today but here proves her dramatic chops also. It may be a role that had one eye on Oscar, but in this case it would have been totally deserved. I haven’t seen Moore’s ‘Still Alice’ performance yet (although the trailer makes it look like a TV movie of the week), but as far as Witherspoon, Cotillard, Jones and Pike are concerned, my vote would have unquestionably gone to Aniston."" ]"

The story gives the impression of a lot going on, but take out the many obligatory romantic interludes and there is definitely less here than meets the eye. Both the heist and the escape from prison are so easily accomplished that one could believe it would have been harder if the guards had personally let them in and out, respectively.

The story in no way feels contrived and the more intimate scenes are very sensitively handled. Only the depiction of the bullies comes over as somewhat cartoonish, but this in no way spoils a rather tender little film. The ending is lovely."" ]"
selma;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Based on true historical fact, Selma has a great asset in a lean screenplay which omits extraneous story threads in favour of just honing in on the voting rights of blacks in the Deep South. Using the state of Alabama as its anchor the film tells of a series of marches organised by Martin Luther King in order to win those rights. Establishing scenes make one fear that an unwanted history lesson is on the cards. However, once the marches start in earnest the film emits an undeniably emotive power. Scenes of preparation for the peaceful demonstrations are successfully juxtaposed with the violent solutions planned by the police and officials."", ""David Oyelowo is dignified as King and the domestic moments with his wife are tender even as they show him to be a flawed womaniser. Also his scenes with Tom Wilkinson, a standout as Lyndon B Johnson, are probably the best in the movie. Ava Du Vernay's direction is unflashy but she does get the most from her talented cast including Tim Roth, who, as George Wallace, also shares a wonderfully written scene with Wilkinson. For a two hour plus movie it doesn’t really drag once the main narrative gets underway. It’s actually a small film with a big subject matter. The Oscar nominated song Glory which, whilst not that inspired as a piece of music, pertinently and unashamedly declares a suitably victorious outcome for the oppressed."" ]"

The story is also so much more even if its complexity causes the scratching of one’s head in puzzlement from time to time. This is definitely not a story that kids will understand and even a few adults will be left somewhat confused. Never-the less it is a thing of beauty and originality that deserves your money far more than the likes of ‘Minions’ and ‘Big Hero Six’ ever could. The film is also enriched by a beautiful score and a lovely end titles ballad, the ‘Song of the Sea’."" ]"
pride-2014;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Pride is a film to be proud of. What could have turned out to be a schmaltzy, politicized comedy drama full of stock characters and clichéd situations is, for the most part, anything but. Sure, there are political statements being made about a period of British history that affected the lives of many miners, and yes, it also highlights the continuing struggle of the gay and lesbian community circa 1984. However, the film is extremely well written with a strong story and is directed with restraint by Matthew Warchus. He never over extends scenes that threaten to get one groaning in anticipation of the obvious. In fact the tone of the film is just right. The comedy is sometimes laugh out loud funny and the drama is very affecting. One can't help but be moved by many scenes. The cast helps immeasurably, especially the older star names who effortlessly delineate identifiably believable characters. Since Vera Drake, Imelda Staunton has been an actress in demand on smaller quality projects because she is just so good. Her performance here is just confirmation of her stature. Bill Nighy, Paddy Considine and Andrew Scott also stand out. Strangely, Dominic West seems miscast as an older, rather flamboyant gay man, but there is no denying the energy and enthusiasm with which he successfully carries off a big dance number. In this one sequence he almost owns the film."", ""Ultimately, all these pluses add up to a feel good comedy drama that doesn't make the serious issues  it is tackling portentous or heavy. The end titles provide interesting information about the characters and the period in question, some of which was certainly news to me, as was the story told within the film itself."" ]"

Mark Ruffalo is superb, as usual, in a pivotal supporting role, but the real revelation is Channing Tatum. The guy shows us here that he really can act.

the-homesman;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Although The Homesman is beautifully crafted with some striking visuals its uneven tone has a detrimental effect on the movie's end result. Things start promisingly as we observe Hilary Swank going about her daily life on the farm, but as soon as she starts trekking across the prairie to Iowa with Tommy Lee Jones and three mad women in tow the interest quickly starts to dissipate. By the end I felt as if I had been on the journey with them and wasn't far off crazy myself. Swank and Jones are a good pairing with the latter providing some fitfully amusing moments. Swank is at her most outstanding in a very moving scene in which she asks Jones to marry her."", ""Contrary to what the critics have been saying the film is at its best when the surprise exit of a major character allows the film to remove itself from the boredom of the plains. The introduction of other players, notably James Spader (hamming it up deliciously) and Meryl Streep each in their own singular scene, injects some much needed drama into proceedings. This last half hour does, in fact, hint at how good the film could have been had it taken another route."" ]"

Baymax is a lovely character, but the plotting is so predictable that the interest remains muted. Needless to say it's a big hit and sequels will undoubtedly follow, but I for one will sign out here."", ""Far superior is the accompanying short 'Feast' which is an absolute delight. With regards to this double bill, less is certainly more."" ]"
the-theory-of-everything;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The Theory of Everything is basically a very conventional love story at its core. Based on the memoir by Jane Hawking it is at first surprising to find how much the screenplay concentrates on her. It is to the credit of Felicity Jones that she becomes the film’s ace card. She truly shines here as Jane and it is almost totally due to her subtly understated performance that the story’s emotions feel honest and not overly manipulated. Eddie Redmayne is also very good, especially with the physicality the role demands, but surprisingly his role seems somewhat underwritten. The screenplay pays scant attention to his professional achievements concentrating instead on his disability and the challenges this posed to the couple’s marriage. Anyone not knowing anything about Stephen Hawking going in to this film would be hard pressed to understand the reverence in which he is held, the tragedy of his physical battles notwithstanding. Ironically, criticism levelled at 'The Imitation Game' and the lack of personal details about Alan Turing's personal life would be more pertinently aimed here at Hawking's professional one.  Montages are adopted to delineate time lines to mixed success, but probably the biggest indication of the film’s failure is due to the fact that one is more interested in the love story between Jane and Jonathan than in the one between Jane and Stephen."" ]"
horrible-bosses-2;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Very entertaining comedy which is perhaps just a tad overlong. The screenplay may not be the most sophisticated one out there, but it does provide loads of laughs. In fact the dialogue is so fast and furious that some jokes get sacrificed along the way if you so much as look at your pop corn. A lot of the humour is very crude but the playing of the cast is so lively, enthusiastic and good natured that offense is never taken."", ""Jason Bateman makes for an impressive 'straight' foil to the comic goonery provided by Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis,, and both Chris Pine and Jennifer Anniston enter into the spirit of the movie with their tongues very firmly in their cheeks. Only Christoph Waltz is a bit tiresome. The two time Oscar winner's 'wolf in sheep's clothing' grin is beginning to pall a bit in its repetitiveness. He really does need to try and stretch himself in future projects before he becomes to firmly entrenched in the realms of self parody."", ""Overall though, this is a better than average comedy that is consistently good fun."" ]"
into-the-woods;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Being extensively marketed for kids, it is good to find that Sondheim’s musical has been neither dumbed down nor Disneyfied. Taking four well-loved fairy tales complete with linking device and setting them to music is actually quite a bold concept which, for the first ninety minutes at least, works very nicely. In fact, the visuals compliment the score no end which, if listened to cold, is actually fairly resistible without its context. Only one song can truly be considered a hit outside of its theatrical origins and that is ‘Children Will Listen’, but other songs are still impressive. It helps that most of the cast make a good stab at singing even if one recognises their limitations. Meryl Streep, however, is in a class of her own both musically and dramatically. Notching up her 19th Oscar nomination for her ‘witch’ she eclipses everyone with impressive ease. Chris Pine surprises as Prince Charming and he belts out one of the best staged songs, ‘Agony’. Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Emily Blunt as The Baker’s wife and James Corden as the Baker all have their moments to shine as does Johnny Depp as the Wolf. His rendition of ‘Hello Little Girl’ (which shows that Disney have certainly moved with the times, since Snow White sang ‘Someday my Prince will come’) is certainly open to suspect interpretation!"", ""The film looks good in production and costume design and is photographed in a convincingly cold light as befits its dark tone."", ""The film begins to fall apart, however, after its perceived happy ending is suddenly tossed aside with the introduction of a female giant. This is not only dramatically misguided, but also throws the spotlight onto some appalling special effects work. Hitherto the visual effects have been impressive, but the giant played by Frances De LaTour looks cheaply conceived and unconvincing. It is a shame really that what could have been a consistent of a piece musical is undermined by a final act that should have been thrown out along with Jack’s beans."" ]"
whiplash;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Whiplash is a real crowd pleaser which had the audience I saw it with clapping at the end. It moves at a cracking pace, has some very smart dialogue and boasts a couple of very strong performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons. However, it is almost a film of two halves. The set up, and then the revenge. The first half of the film, whilst good, feels somewhat contrived."", """", ""Drum playing jazz fanatic Andrew (Teller) goes all out to impress respected but feared teacher Fletcher (Simmons) in the hope of joining the school band he leads. This he sees as his possible route to becoming one of the jazz greats. However, he hasn't bargained on the outrageous teaching methods employed by Fletcher which includes humiliating and even attacking his students. Their fragile interaction puts them on a collision course."", """", ""Both performances are undoubtedly excellent, but Teller really has the more difficult role and stands tall against Simmons more obvious grandstanding. As the cruel and foul mouthed Fletcher, Simmons shouts, swears and screams a lot, much in the vein of an army drill instructor, but these outbursts sometimes have the effect of appearing phony and calculated, merely there to elicit laughs or rouse an audience. Like wise, Teller's acquisition, and subsequent ditching of a girl friend, and scenes of him pushing himself on the drums to the point that his hands become blistered and bloodied, strike false notes. Again,they feel like plot contrivances which, although demonstrating sacrifices made on route to success, actually feel included just to provide fuel for the film's better second half."", ""The final half hour is very satisfyingly concluded as the two actors dual it out to thrilling and nail biting effect. The film also benefits from a  great jazz score which permeates throughout and the film is briskly and imaginatively edited."" ]"
the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""The third and final instalment of this overblown adaptation of the rather slight book arrives with a whimper rather than a bang. Following on from the delight that was ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ this film is an exercise in tedium. Picking up the story as Smaug wreaks havoc on Lake Town village, things start promisingly enough but with the dragon’s dramatic departure we are plunged into scenes of excessive chatter which all but stalls the interest. It doesn’t help that the extras milling around seem amateurish and under rehearsed and a lot of the ensuing dialogue provides unintentional mirth. The battle scenes are badly staged and unexcitingly edited and the film has a messy, untidy feel to it. One actually begins to forget what it’s all about."", ""Apart from Richard Armitage, who is excellent, the actors add little and Ryan Gage is particularly annoying as Alfrid. The score by Howard Shore is by turns soft and melodic and then overly emphatic as it tries to add drama to scenes that are singularly lacking any. Visually the film is still a success, although the CGI occasionally lets it down, but what the film fatally lacks is the fantastical magic and mystery that made the rings trilogy so wondrously brilliant."", ""The last 20 minutes or so improve somewhat as the dwarves fight the dark lord Sauron on the snow and ice. These sequences, along with the opening, sport the best of the visuals and provide the most excitement. Here we are treated to, amongst other things, collapsing bridges, giant birds and cohesive individual combat. Overall, though, one is just thankful when the song ‘The Last Goodbye’ warbles onto the soundtrack. This mercifully offers pleasing confirmation that the uneven trilogy has finally concluded. Amen to that."" ]"
the-judge;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Encumbered by a trailer that doesn't do it justice and critics reviews that keep using the term 'mawkish' as if it's going out of fashion, 'The Judge' turns out to be a much better film than expected. Anchored by two powerful performances Its hefty running time just flies by. I concede that at times it seems in danger of toppling into paint by number TV movie of the week territory, but to its credit this doesn't actually happen. The two Roberts, Downey jnr and Duval, play off against each other perfectly, even if for me Downey Jnr has the edge. He never puts a facial expression wrong and I believed his character totally."", ""A bathroom scene between the pair starts off shockingly but, with perfectly judged precision, becomes lighter as the scene progresses. The delicacy of the playing here makes these moments a highlight."", ""The supporting cast don't really have a lot to do but are all more than adequate and the screenplay to its credit does offer up a fair share of surprising plot twists."", ""On the negative side the score single handedly threatens to derail the whole thing as it is far too syrupy.

annabelle;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Effective little chiller that benefits from some imagination in the direction and three or four scenes that are a credit to the genre. In fact the first real scene of horror is one of which Hitchcock could be proud. The attractive leads are also better than the usual cyphers placed in these types of films and the story is generally quite logically played out. References to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' abound and there are definitely shocks to be had along the way. One sequence involving a sewing machine, a hob and some popcorn is cut to elicit maximum tension. Two supporting players are effectively presented with menacing undertones, but the movie's biggest mystery remains why anyone would want to own such a sinister looking doll in the first place. The final scenes become somewhat predictable, but I must say that it sets up the scenario for last year's' The Conjuring' very nicely, and is actually preferable."" ]"
gone-girl;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Gillian Flynn's book 'Gone Girl' is one of the best novels that I have read in years. It has great characters, intrigue and a bold ending that would definitely not be to everyone's taste. It's a real intelligent page turner that once started can't be put down. The problem with 'Gone Girl' the film is that it has been so faithfully adapted, too faithfully even, by Flynn herself that there are no surprises to be had. I acknowledge that this sounds churlish when there are so many book adaptations that are bad, but the lack of surprise unfortunately dulls the movie experience. The film is well cast. The setting feels right and the score sets an appropriate tone. However, David Fincher's unfussy direction does nothing to add an extra visual dimension to the story. As a result I felt somewhat disappointed by my own reaction, even whilst rationalising the reason for it. As already stated the actors are almost perfect fits for their roles. Ben Affleck is better than I had expected and really carries the film. Rosamund Pike, although over praised, is still good and the supporting cast are pretty much spot on, with a special mention to Neil Patrick Harris. The sequences that involve him are amongst the best in the film."", ""In summation I can only say that for people who have not read the book this should be a most rewarding experience. Fans of the source material, however, might want to think a little harder about there expectations before viewing."" ]"
the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Lacking the spectacle, colour and even the games themselves this is still an enjoyable instalment in what is undoubtedly the best franchise currently being produced. Whilst unquestionably the weakest of the three films to date it still has much to commend it. Top of the list has to be the excellent Jennifer Lawrence for whom the word coasting doesn't seem to exist in her vocabulary. With this role she has created a female heroine the like of whom hasn't been seen since Sigourney Weaver delighted us in the 'Alien' films. The tone of this chapter is certainly darker (even without all the killing) and there is less action and more exposition, but somehow it all works. Julianne Moore is a welcome addition to the cast and effortlessly integrates herself into the film. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman shamefully has little to do in this his last film appearance and Liam Hemsworth is limp and uninteresting as Lawrence's Conflicted love interest. Still, it's all very watchable even though more will be expected from next year's final act."" ]"

The earlier film, however, lacked this one's delightful emotional connection. Helen Mirren doesn't have to stretch herself too much here as a Michelin starred restaurant owner suddenly confronted with competition, but she is superb."", ""The film has been skilfully and lovingly made and director Hallstrom's uses a variety of techniques, aided by smart editing, to make the film's flow seem lyrical and effortless. Tracking shots,super imposed images and fade outs serve the simple cross cultural story well. The radiantly colourful cinematography, the very picturesque setting and the beautifully unobtrusive score combine and contribute to a very tasty dish indeed."", ""All the actors are a delight and the scenes of food preparation are seductively shot to make you feel hungry. My only quibbles are that some of the romantic interludes are conventionally predictable and also the early 'battling' between Mirren and Puri comes over as a bit twee. This aside, however, the film really works and the end result leaves one feeling like you have just par taken of a delicious meal at a fine dining establishment. Undoubtedly one of the most purely satisfying films of 2014, and another that has been undervalued by the sniffy critics."" ]"

Then two more songs quickly follow (Big Girls Don't Cry and Walk Like a Man) within a time frame of 15 minutes. From here on in the film starts to come alive and the second half presents a much more cohesive and digestible movie."", """", ""The opening hour is full of caricature and every cornball cliché in the bio-pic book and makes for tedious, even irritating viewing. This is compounded by an annoying performance from Vincent Piazza as bad boy Tommy, who thankfully all but disappears from the last act. The actors portraying the other band members fare much better. Michael Lomenda is best at delivering the direct to camera monologues, a device which generally adds nothing beyond its gimmicky intent. Erich Bergen stands out as song writer Bobby and John Lloyd Young, after a bit of a struggle, manages to get to grips with Frankie Valli."", """", ""Despite seeming to possess all the right credentials to make the film soar, it has to be said that Clint Eastwood's direction is for the most part both listless and uninspired. The cinematography is flat and the colour palette washed out, especially in the first half. Other production values seem strangely muted for a period piece. There is perfect precision though, in one lengthy but excellent scene revolving around money issues, which also signals the end for the group."", """", ""The last scene over the final credits demonstrates what the film could have technically done better. This sequence is cut well and finally we have some colour and pizzazz in a musical number. Before this, competence alone has reigned supreme leaving the songs themselves to elevate proceedings.

Well, it's certainly dumb but the quality (and even the disappointing setting) is anything but big. Jeff Bridges spends the entire film with a look of angst plastered on his face, and Meryl Streep, in an unflattering wig, once again proves that she is a compelling force despite bad material."", ""The special effects have a cut price feel to them and the only real show of imagination thrown up is to have the film slowly transcend from black and white to colour as the young lead protagonist expands his knowledge.

Children will be able to appreciate and enjoy the archaic action and cute characters, and also be more forgiving of all the nonsense taking place in the final 20 minutes.

Therefore, it is with unreserved enthusiasm that I can recommend whole heartedly this latest chapter in the simian saga. The whole package just couldn't have been put together better, but it has to be said that a lion's share of the credit has to go to director Matt Reeves who previously thrilled us with his visually stunning and equally dark 'Cloverfield'. Helped by a surprisingly dense and impressive screenplay he has managed to inject in to familiar proceedings, depth of character, excitement, pathos and suspense and yet has still found time to inventively position the camera to jaw dropping effect. There is even some slow motion, 360 degree camera pans and knock out crane shots. In fact we have everything here but the kitchen sink and it all works beautifully. The story is good and there is definite deliberation in the pacing which is perfectly judged and balances the action sequences with the many quieter and more reflective moments."", """", ""Technically the movie is everything that you would expect.. The cinematography is dark but luminous. The production design and visual effects are state of the art brilliant and the music gives the film its menacing undercurrent which is underlined by some of the best sound work for ages.

Mark Ruffalo is outstanding here and there is real chemistry between him and Keira Knightley, sporting a very acceptable singing voice. Supporting actors also contribute to the charm, although a little of James Cordon does go a long way. Unfamiliar New York locations are also refreshingly used."", ""Personally I enjoyed it more than John Carney's previous hit, 'Once', and it does share that film's love of music and the endurance of the human spirit.

Unfortunately, edge of seat thrills are what is sadly lacking. Scenes start promisingly enough, but tension is never sufficiently generated and the film sinks under a morass of unfulfilled expectation. There are twists and turns along the way, but these are not handled skilfully enough to make the film a winner and only a couple of moments come close to creating any kind of frisson.

As a movie, fans of the horror and thriller genres will be in their element. Directed with cold efficiency, atmospherically photographed and grippingly edited the film makes many social political statements along the way. Surprisingly the story strands come together fairly well and generally make for credible viewing. However, a scene in which the protagonists take sanctuary in a house of a friend strikes a definite false note and is risible in its ridiculousness."", ""The gulf between rich and poor is a prominent theme as is the corruption of governments and politicians.

However, when he does things liven up no end. For all its other inadequacies, visually this is a stunning achievement. When the titular character and special effects take centre stage there is just no faulting the film as the craft on display is just amazing. Images like a crashed plane; Godzilla in the sea flanked by ships, A Tsunami, A burning train, shadows of the monsters aginst the city's crumbling buildings and Godzilla's face disappearing in to a pall of smoke are just a few of the breath taking compositions to behold. There are countless more, all exquisitely photographed."", """", ""All this good work is somewhat predictably confounded by the dull human angle and perfunctory screenplay.

locke;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Employing the risky premise of one person holding centre stage for an entire film, Locke does not go the way of similar enterprises like 'All is Lost' and ' Buried' and is, in fact, extremely hypnotic.  A solid if slight story line is handed to lead actor Tom Hardy and he delivers in aces changing emotions as he would the gears in his car. His performance is a tour de force master class in acting. For 85 minutes, and from the confines of the afore mentioned vehicle, he runs an emotional gamut  encompassing frustration, barely suppressed anger, sadness and even humour. It is a pertinent reminder, if one was necessary, of just how good an actor he is."" ]"

mad-max-fury-road;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It’s been thirty years since Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome hit the cinemas bearing almost no resemblance whatsoever with 1979’s Mad Max and its sequel in 1981, The Road Warrior. The original Mad Max was uniquely odd and the second film, if memory serves correctly, was exciting if a tad more conventional. Beyond Thunderdome was just a disaster. A copper bottomed clinker that had Tina Turner appear for novelty value in addition to a load of dishevelled snotty nosed brats. This combination ensured thatt the turn off was complete. Thankfully, Fury Road is considerably better than that debacle, but is some way behind the earlier two instalments and is certainly not worthy of the euphoric reviews and praise that have been heaped upon it by both the critics and public, singing in unison for once it would appear. Production values are sound and it must be said that visually the film is an absolute delight. John Seale’s cinematic compositions for day and night are constantly impressive and there is one corker of a moment when what looks like a sand dune suddenly metamorphosis’s into Max (Tom Hardy). There is also much stylisation in the battle scenes with jump cuts adding immeasurably to the impact and editing that moves along at the rate of knots. The sound is another strong plus and whilst there is plenty of appropriate menace in the score one is unprepared for just how beautiful the music is here."", ""So what’s wrong with it? Well, unfortunately, the story is as light as a feather. This is basically just a two hour chase movie and only the most dedicated Max fans will not be tempted to give in to the unerring crash, bang, and wallop pointlessness of it all, despite the many technical strengths on display. Of the actors, Charlize Theron is really rather good in a role that is a million miles away from anything she has ever done before. Nicholas Hoult, unrecognisable under impressive make-up, is ok, but the weakest of the three leads. I use the term ‘lead’ loosely as Tom Hardy’s Max seems to be relegated to a supporting role here, even if the actor turns in another one of his customarily good performances. There is no doubting that Hardy is a better actor than Gibson, but for my money Max 1 and 2 remain the yardsticks by which the other films should be judged."" ]"

Some concise narration at the beginning sets the scene, but the story matters little. Basically this is the formula as before, the main difference being that most of the battles here take place on the sea rather than on land. Production Design vies with CGI for attention and continues to blur the line between these two crafts. Likewise, the somewhat bombastic score competes with Dolby sound. The one thing of which the film cannot be accused is to not have used all the technologies at its disposal. Viewed in an IMAX format and in 3D (D Box was also an additional option) the film is certainly a feast for the eye and ear. The speed ramping gimmick is again employed to enhance the dubious enjoyment of torn flesh, severed limbs and lashings of blood flying off the screen. One thing is for sure, subtlety was obviously not discovered in THIS century."", """", ""Acting wise, Eva Green steals the film and she has an erotically charged scene of sexual power play with leading man Sullivan Stapleton (Strike Back) which is also as camp as Christmas.

Liam Neeson should have rested on his laurels instead of trying to be a new Jason Bourne. In fact this film is worse than 'Taken' and that's saying something.

Chris Pine, Kiera Knightley, Kenneth Brannagh and Kevin Costner all offer up excellent characterisations and it's good to see Knightley out of costume (period costume, that is) for a change. Brannagh, complete with foreign accent, offers up a villain to compete with the best and his directorial style keeps everything fast and furious. He seems to be relishing the change of pace with this film and his previous one, 'Thor', which was an equally action packed and even more ambitious project. In any event both are a long way from the literate and stately Shakespeare movies that have been his signature directorial achievements up to now."", ""Only the final chase sequence lets things down as the story becomes more improbable and frenetic.

Darren Aronofsky, usually one of the best visual directors around, takes a fair while to bring his undoubted talent to the fore concentrating instead on character development and uninteresting family dialogue. Even the visual effects, including some rock monsters that look as if they have just stepped out of a Transformers movie, seem dislocated from everything else going on at this time. In fact, it's not until the tremendous battle for the ark that things start to improve. From here, it's onwards and upwards and the cast finally have some dialogue and drama to sink their teeth into. A crazed Russell Crowe starts to lose it; Jennifer Connelly steals the acting honours in just two scenes; Emma Watson cries a lot, but shows real promise here, and even Ray Winstone is rather good in a baddie role that he can play in his sleep."", """", ""Once aboard the ark Aronofsky finally delivers what one has come to expect from him and the visual effects also become more integrated into the story. The animals arrival at the ark is wonderful as is a backwards tracking shot of the vessel from end to end. Also, one sequence is surprising in its unpredictability. Ultimately you leave the cinema fairly satisfied even as you begin to question things like; if they are the only ones left how did they re-populate?  Oh well, it's only a film."" ]"

However, this is a film about spectacle (and i'm not talking about the tacky disaster films  thrown up every so often) and in this department it delivers in spades."", ""It has pace in abundance and is imaginatively directed employing a variety of camera shots, along with adequate 3D, to impressive effect. The back story is fine and it builds quite nicely to the main event, the eruption of Vesuvius, which is really what we have come to see. The destruction of Pompeii is spectacularly realised with some absolutely stunning CGI which are possibly the best of the year so far (give or take the odd wobble). In fact before all this drama begins there is also much nail biting tension to be had in the coliseum as the gladiators fight it out for survival. This may all seem very familiar but this second half just never lets the pace slip. Fast and furious editing ratchets up the tension and the film, aided by a beautiful and rousing score, holds you in a vice like grip. No excess padding or accusations of over length can be made here. The film is just nail bitingly edge of seat stuff."", ""My only minor quibble is that visually it lacks colour (as did Legend of Hercules) in its costumes, sets and photography, even though in all these departments excellence is otherwise demonstrated. The city is credibly reconstructed and the lighting is often extremely effective.

The film fascinatingly touches on his involvement and explores the possibility of repercussions affecting his Hollywood career. After all one has to admit this is a long way from Disney's Oz."", ""The film does raise many very pertinent points about human conditioning and sexuality which are definitely topics for debate. However, because of its subject matter and some explicit sexual material, it will certainly have a very limited audience. Ultimately, and in all probability, it will find itself preaching to the converted. Oddly, though, it was meant to be a film about the afore mentioned cut 40 minutes.

These 'fallen women' were forced into convents which were run like work houses in order for them 'to cleanse their sins'. Many were in their early teens and most never saw their children again after adoption. This film concerns the search by one such mother,Philomena, who along with a journalist sets out to find the son she hasn't seen in nearly 50 years."", ""Judi Dench plays the title character and her performance is a class act. She gives an effortlessly briliiant and believable portrayal of this tortured, but hopeful woman. She is an actress to whom her art just seems to come naturally and she is again at the top of her game. Steve Coogan is also very good as the journalist and he can take another bow for co-authoring the richly textured screenplay. Whilst the writing tackles serious issues it still manages to tap into some wonderful humour in the midst of this desperately sad situation. The film, though, is certainly never mawkish, but it is at times genuinely affecting. In fact, the only thing that comes out bad here is the light shining on the Catholic Church."" ]"

Still, once the four begin their mission to kill a notorious Taliban leader the film becomes a bone crunching adrenalin rush. Hiding out on a mountain which soon becomes a battleground the four are soon up to there necks in gunfire, explosions and blood. These battles excitingly staged and full of nail biting tension are enhanced by hand held camera photography which effectively creates a sense of chaos and confusion. Sound effects unflinchingly capture every bullet impact, fall or smashed body part as the four find themselves battling an army of Taliban whilst not having any immediate means of escape.

Things are not helped by Meryl Streep's initial appearance in which she is way over the top, the mechanics of her particular acting style all too visible. It takes about 30 minutes for the film to properly  find its feet with both acting and writing seeming very uneven. However, with the very entertaining dinner sequence events seem to come very much alive. Streep settles brilliantly in to her bullish and bullying matriarch and the writing also finds its natural rhythm, ultimately telling a good story with more than a few surprises up its sleeve. Julia Roberts, often too knowing in her roles, is fantastic here. In between all the fights and vitriol going around she shows great subtlety in some of the quieter scenes with her facial expressions doing a lot of the work. Margo Martindale also has a corker of a scene which propels an important plot point. In fact the women in the cast outshine their male counterparts by a considerable margin. At the film's close it came as somewhat of a surprise to realise just how much I had enjoyed the preceding two hours."" ]"

The design of the film, as in a lot of Anderson's work, is just beautiful and many effects are visually striking. A positive roster of character actors contribute to the fun (Saoirse Ronan's lack lustre turn aside) with Tllda Swinton and  Willem Dafoe standing out. Everything is elevated, however, by the absolutely brilliant performance of Ralph Fiennes which is second only to his Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. I may still have reservations about Anderson and to a lesser extent this film, but if Fiennes isn't nominated for an Oscar next  year for this deliciously sublime portrayal then that will be more of a farce than the film itself."" ]"

It actually played more like a thriller than a small drama. The Past seems to be trying to replicate the formula, but for the most part it fails. In actuality it is a well acted but fairly ordinary film which only really comes alive in the last section when the true catalogue of events is finally revealed. Here the movie adopts 'A Separation's' bravura style and becomes more interesting. The shame is that by only half heartedly emulating the earlier film this one, by comparison, ends up being bland. Whereas 'A Separation' soared from beginning to end, The Past only flutters AT the end. Of the afore mentioned performances Tahar Rahim is the best as Berenice Bejo's boyfriend."" ]"

It seems to exist in no man's land wanting to be all thing's to all people and ending up offering very little of anything to anyone. It's not CGI heavy or action packed enough to be considered a block buster and it's too redundantly lame to be good romantic/comedy/drama. In fact what we have is an anaemic romance that provides a linking device to a series of visual fantasies. These fantasy moments which crop up about every 15-20 minutes are, in themselves, not too bad, but they can't prevent the film from seeming half hearted and empty. Ben stiller is ok as the lead character zoning in to more exciting worlds, but I much preferred Adam Scott as one of the heads of Life magazine where Stiller works. His presence, as a kind of villain, bucks one up whenever he appears. The same cannot be said for Sean Penn in a small cameo. This is certainly a strange choice of movie for him. I just hpe he isn't heading down the same road taken by Robert De Niro, destination nowhere, artistically. Locations in Greenland and Iceland are stunning.

This Second World War story is based on a best selling novel but its adaptation here is protracted and bloodless and must be classed a major disappointment. Young Sophie Nelisse, as the titular character, looks the part but her line delivery at times comes over as phonetic. The production itself looks immaculate, but again this is also a big problem. as everything is just so pristine. At one point Emily Watson berates the girl as being 'filthy' when in fact she looks as if she is on her way to a photo shoot. A bogus in-authenticity pervades and prevents the film from generating any true emotion or pathos. John Williams' pretty score adds to the detrimental effect and actually feels as if it belongs to another type of movie in another era. A couple of scenes do ignite. The cellar search grabs one's attention temporarily and the ending, coming as it does from left field, causes one to stir in a way that the rest of the film never does. I also have to mention that the scene where Geoffrey Rush plays his accordion whilst everyone is hiding in an air raid shelter, made me think that the cast were going to start singing Oom Pah Pah a la Carol Reed's musical Oliver!  One thing I did like was the unusual narrative device which is intrigueingly employed at the beginning and used to devastating effect at the end."" ]"

Pennsylvania looks every bit as bleak as I remember it from 'The Deer Hunter' and this is perfectly captured in the stark cinematography. The camera's eye treats the steel mill and surrounding areas as if they are another character and you really do get a sense of the place and the unfulfilled lives of the people living there. At times the film's tone is extremely tense, a lot of which is due to the menacing performance of Woody Harrelson who looks as if he has just stepped out of 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Christian Bale, in a rare understated but none the less brilliant turn, is even better here than he is n his Oscar nominated role in 'American Hustle'. Casey Affleck and Willem Defoe also impress and one has to applaud Sam Shepard, who seems to have an uncanny knack for being only minimally involved in really good films. The music is surprisingly beautiful given the content, which is at times extremely violent, and the film holds you in a vice like grip from beginning to end. Ironically, it is only the overt symbolism attached to the deer hunt and bare knuckle fight scenes that can be slightly criticised but, in truth, to do so would be pernickety as this is a truly outstanding film."" ]"

From this dysfunctional background sprung forth her flying nanny. The other half of the film is indeed about the making of the famous 1964 movie starring Oscar winning Julie Andrews, which is in itself over rated."", ""The main problem is that the film is boringly repetitive and the juxtaposing of Travers' child hood with her time in L A is totally un-interesting. Things aren't helped by Emma Thompson's irritatingly mannered and tiresome performance (An Oscar nomination I have heard mentioned. REALLY!!!!!!). Also Tom Hanks' brilliance as Captain Phillips has certainly been hijacked here in his playing of Walt Disney. In fact the best parts of the film involve the Sherman brothers composing or performing the now famous music. I also have to admit to loving the line  Poor A A Milne' which Ms Thompson utters in disgust on finding a stuffed Pooh bear in her hotel room. However, aside from the occasional line of inspired dialogue, most of the script has Thompson constantly enunciating in the negative which becomes wearisome indeed.

All the series' constants are present including impressive make-up and special visual effects, as well as beautiful Art-Direction and great sound.

Aside from an awful supporting performance from Stephen Fry as 'The Master of Lake Town', 'The Desolation of Smaug' really does deliver.

Watts' committed performance is actually very good and she captures Diana's body language, mannerisms and vocal inflection perfectly. The main issue is that the script makes the central love story totally ordinary and uninteresting. To this end Naveen Andrews dull performance doesn't help and a lack of chemistry between the two leads is palpable. The film is watchable and not quite the debacle that dismissive critics have suggested, but a decent dullness is the keynote. Iconic images from newspapers and magazines are captured and integrated effectively, and some information was new to me.

The man himself comes over as a paradox, charismatic on one hand, but also Machiavellian and self serving. His life has certainly been eventful, what with his bout with cancer, and one does get a sense that he feels a deep sorrow about the lie that not only crushed him, but also affected the lives of many others. The film pertinently points out that even though his 7 championships were won with the help of drugs, this was in an era when the whole sport was tarnished in this way. It's also interesting to be privy to other smaller corruptions that were taking place on the track, with intense rivalries not just between other teams and individuals, but also between team mates!

lee-daniels-the-butler;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Interminable plod through America's civil war movement seen through the experiences of a Butler serving several presidents over many years in the White House. The film cannot escape the feeling of being fake, trivialised and manufactured in its self important telling of an awful chapter in American History. It also feels very second hand with key events mostly being depicted via archive footage, mainly on a TV screen. Also, as soon as anything bad or dramatic happens the obligatory music kicks in for added impact often with that reliable crutch, the gospel choir at hand. This has the effect of producing schmaltz rather than gravitas."", ""A starry cast, generally playing presidents or first ladies to mixed success, give a cough and a spit and are gone. However, anyone expecting (as I did) for this to be a more serious expose of White house politics will be sorely disappointed. This is first and foremost about the Butler and his family. The film has a lot to say potentially, but ultimately, due to the story's priorities very little is actually said. Forrest Whittaker and Oprah Winfrey are undeniably good, but this is Oscar bait work to be sure. For a really natural and un self conscious performance just watch the far superior Lupita Nyong'O in the artistically much better 12 years a slave. No grand standing here, just great work! On the technical side the film is nothing special. The cinematography at times has a grainy look to it and it's definitely far too long. By the film's close I felt that I had aged with the two leads and lived the history."" ]"

These afore mentioned backing artists, and others, share with us their frustrations, disappointments and the love for what they do. And let's not forget their talent. In many instances they are vocally superior to many of the lead entertainers that they support. However, as Sting so concisely puts it, 'It's not always about the talent'.

american-hustle;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Anticipating American Hustle I was convinced that it would be one of my top films of the year. After all it has a great cast, a talented director and a trailer that makes it look exciting and complex. Unfortunately, its complexity is a major flaw. The story is so convoluted that maximum attention is demanded. However, excessive lengh and a tendancy towards the pedantic encourages the attention to wander. The cast give it their all. Christian Bale continues to create zany out there characters; Jennifer Lawrence is fun, but obvious; Bradley Cooper is way over the top, and Jeremy Renner flies under the radar.The real news here is Amy Adams who all but steals the film. Excitingly cast against her usual 'good girl' type, she gives a power house performance that is her best to date. She and Bale are the film's strongest asset and it benefits from their chemistry together. Production values are spot on in depicting the 70's fashion, with hair and costumes creating a great diversion. It also contains a wonderful pop soundtrack of the era which encourages one to reminisce. In the final analysis American Hustle, sadly, lacks something. This leaves one feeling that the whole does not add up to the sum of its,quite excellent, parts."" ]"

Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley give remarkably fresh performances helped no end by an intelligent screenplay. Teller is utterly charming and Woodley is believably vulnerable (so different from her Descendants turn). At the start of the film I did have some difficulty in catching all the dialogue and at first I wasn't sure if it was down to the actors' delivery or just due to appalling sound. It actually must be the former as once I got used to the performers dialect the problem disappeared. The film is basically about life growing up and all the pleasures and pain that entails. The film's tonal changes are perfectly handled (including one absolutely shocker of a moment that had me literally gasping as it was so unexpected) and the end result is surprising and richly rewarding. It's also great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh back on screen albeit in a thankless mother role. I must say that I went to this film with no expectations and I knew absolutely nothing whatsoever about it. Well, it certainly lives up to its title's adjective as it is spectacular indeed!"" ]"

carrie;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""After over 150 viewings Brian De Palma's 1976 version of 'Carrie' remains my favourite film of all time. Therefore, if anyone was going to take issue with this remake it was going to be me. The first thing to be said about this new version is that as a film in its own right it does work. Kimberly Peirce is to be commended for doing a credible job in attempting to put a fresh slant on the material. The big question hanging over the whole enterprise, though, is whether a remake was really necessary. The answer to that has to be a resounding NO. However good Peirce's version is it compares unfavourably, in every aspect, to the sublime master class of De Palma's film. I have always viewed the original as more of a social commentary than an out and out horror movie and De Palma effortlessly switched gears between the comedy, horror and romance. This combination made his vision a very satisfying experience"", ""Performance wise, Chloe Grace Moretz is actually better than I think she has been given critical credit for in the title role, but let's face it she was never going to come close to topping Sissy Spacek's iconic playing of the character. Likewise Julianne Moore, an actress whom I greatly admire, grounds her Margaret White in a more believable reality than did Piper Laurie. However, I still prefer Laurie's over the top loon. Also one misses Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, John Travolta, Betty Buckley and PJ Soles. Their replacements do not come close to the incarnations of those original actors. In fact Ansel Elgort (Tommy Ross) and Barry Shebaka Henley (Principle Morton) are noticeably inferior to their original counterparts."", ""Even though Peirce has stated that she was returning to the book for this new version, it does feel at times as if she is cherry picking from the novel as well as plagiarising De Palma's film. For older viewers the new version suffers also from audience expectation as scenes and lines of dialogue are anticipated and compared, even if unwittingly, to the superior original. The prom scene 2013 totally lacks the magic and romanticism of De Palma's version and the blood falling on the hapless Carrie, shot from three angles, is totally mis-judged. Similarly, Moretz's playing of the all encompassing revenge that follows is interpreted here as being enjoyable, where as Spacek plays the scene as cathartic, with eyes staring blankly in shock. On the plus side Peirce does handle well the scenes of Carrie's experimentation and discovery of her telekinetic powers. Where her version fails most is with the style. Brian De Palma is all about style, and his set pieces are just jaw droppingly brilliant. He incorporates split screen and slow motion amazingly and to great romantic and nail biting effect. Aided no end by his talented leading lady and her vulnerable and achingly believable portrayal, De Palma's take on the story WILL never be bettered. Also in his corner is that great Pino Donnagio score; The moving relationship that is seen to develop between Spacek and Buckley (which is totally redundant in the new version) and THAT ending. Peirces's last scene was never going to recapture what De Palma achieved. Her ending is somewhat lame and superfluous, underlining the fact that whilst her 'Carrie' is enjoyable entertainment, De Palma's 'Carrie' is a justifiably revered classic."" ]"

adore;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""I have to say that I adored adore. It is a guilty pleasure that I'm sure would have made a good tv mini-series as it doesn't exhaust its own possibilities within the movie. Based on a short story by writer Doris Lessing it is easy to see why cynical highbrow critics would dismiss it as soap, and indeed many have panned it. I am at a loss to know why as it is intelligently adapted and written by Christopher Hampton and Anne Fontaine, who is also the film's director. In fact the writing is generally superb presenting some improbable situations in a natural and believable fashion. Some unintentional humour does creep in from time to time, but overall I was compelled to follow the story's arc. The performances are superb with Robin Wright the standout. Looking more and more like Jessica Lange, she is particularly moving. In scene after scene, many of which are filmed in extreme close up, every nuance of emotion is there to behold on her face. She is stunning here and I am tempted to say that it is the best I have ever seen this under rated actress. With its attractive cast and beautiful locations the film also looks great."" ]"

An intelligent screenplay allows Scorsese to put his indelible stamp on the material.

The end result is a superior mystery thriller, even though a few questions do remain unanswered. The performances contribute a great deal. There is no denying that Hugh Jackman is very good here but he is playing a rather dislike able character, even given the circumstances. His frequent rants tend to dissolve into monotone. Jake Gyllenhaal is much better as the cop. With his constant eye tics and suspicious nature he is the true heart of what makes prisoners ultimately as good as it is.

At a modest  93 minutes there is a lot to pack in and at times scenes seem to end with an exclamation mark to lead us succinctly in to the next chapter of L L's life. The film is very well served by its actors. Amanda Seyfried has never before given such an accomplished performance, but that being so she is still eclipsed by Peter Sarsgaard as her husband Chuck Traynor who, as painted here, is very much the villain of the piece. Sarsgaard is breath takingly brilliant and steals the acting honours from a strong line up of character actors with some ease. An unrecognizable Sharon Stone also registers strongly in support as Linda's down trodden mum and the choice of soundtrack and costumes fit the period to perfection.

The film is also beautifully shot and designed and DePalma has lost none of his skill for drawing the viewer in. What the film does lack, surprisingly, is any really good set pieces which are often the director's piece de resistance."", """", ""The first hour is compulsive viewing as the female protagonists scheme and manipulate ensuring audience intrigue as to where events are going, but with the demise of one of the characters the film begins to fall apart and, unfortunately, it never recovers. This is a story weakness because 'Love Crime' also suffered the same problem at the same point but did manage to get back on track for a good ending. DePalma presents us with his own special kind of ending that just doesn't work here. In fact this final sequence is yet another failed attempt to repeat the 'Carrie' finale which succeeded because it had a genuine shock at its conclusion. Interestingly, the music used for this final sequence would seem to have been lifted straight out of 'Dressed to Kill'"", """", ""The verdict has to be that whilst this is not vintage DePalma, it deserves better than to be shunted out as a 'Straight to DVD' release as has been its fate in the UK.

Tamsin Egerton as Fiona Richmond, Anna Friel as his first wife Jean and Imogen Poots as his daughter Debbie are also all very good. That their performances survive this unremarkable material is to their credit. The film doesn't seem to be able to decide if it's playing the whole thing for comedy or not, despite its tragic conclusion. It ends up being a tedious mess which never satisfactorily brings together the sum of its parts. One learns more about these characters at the end titles than is ever communicated through the preceding 100 minutes. A definite plus is the use of popular 60's and 70's hits on the soundtrack. A definite minus is David Wailliams' out of key supporting turn which would be more at home in one of his tv sitcoms."" ]"

It's ace card, however, is in the hypnotic and multi layered performance of Soren Malling as the C E O of the company whose ship is taken. Whether demonstrating authority, rage or empathy he is central to one's involvement with what is happening on screen. The movie itself could have been tightened up slightly in the mid section where hijackers and hijacked become tentatively and temporarily attuned to one and other.

Family and friends intelligently articulate memories about this complex woman and specifically highlight an affair she had and its subsequent repercussions.

His hesitant but caring character is so unlike anything else he has done, and you are rooting for him to become romantically involved with Joanna Vanderham from there first meeting. The screenplay is for the most part good, but I do feel that Julianne Moore's part is written (and played  so broadly that her character is in danger of being turned into a 'bad mum' caricature. This also has the unfortunate side effect of making Skarsgard and Vanderham's characters almost too saintly. Another slightly  baffling thing in the story (unless I missed something) is how did Skarsgard and Moore know Where Vanderham and the little girl were when they moved to the beach house. Still, I'm being picky as this is one of the better films of the year so far. Onata Aprile as Maisie is perfect lacking any of the precociousness often found in child performances."" ]"

The main problem is that it's setting and story is less appropriate for this over the top kind of  approach. Moulin Rouge was set in a musical revue nightclub and therefore all the outrageous antics could be more readily embraced. The first half feels like Luhrmann wanted to make a musical and was taken with the ides of wild parties, decadence and lavish costumes only to discover halfway through that he had a story to finish telling. In fact it's only when Gatsby turns to 'straight' drama that it works at all. Generally it's a visually stunning mess, although even here everyone and every thing is so perfectly positioned and placed that the artifice in scene after scene wins the day. Performances are unexceptional although DiCaprio acquits himself well. There is less to be said for Tobey Maguire. His performance as neighbour and story narrator Nick Carraway, is bland and borders on the boring. The writing is trite and often undermines the visual style. For all the criticisms that have been levelled at the 1974 Redford/Farrow film, it must be said that the writing, acting and screenplay were all superior to this frenetic self indulgence. On the plus side the main musical theme is just beautiful."" ]"

The voice over narration from the girls' point of view presents it as a kind of utopia that the accompanying visuals deny. There is no denying the technical package, though. Stylised direction, eye catching cinematography and skillful editing help to ensure that the film looks slick and professional and yes, after abandoning my initial misgivings, the film does become hypnotically compelling. James Franco, in another 'out there' performance, is just great as the rapper/gangster Alien and the music by Cliff Martinez adds a whole other dimension to the proceedings. One of the best scenes has James Franco playing piano and the three remaining girls singing a sweet Britney Spears song whilst inter cuts show the violence they have  perpetrated.

There is a lot of back story exposition before the unremarkable ending, (one sudden shock involving a minor character not withstanding) and to say that the plot development requires much suspension of disbelief is to understate. Overall it's a pity because the first half an hour had me enthralled. At best this effort by Danny Boyle can only be considered an interesting mis fire."" ]"
texas-chainsaw-3d;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""A slick addition to the horror franchise with good production values and enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat when you're not jumping out of it. This new film is not half bad picking up from where the original 1974 film left off. For horror fans this more than delivers. The first hour is well modulated to build the expected tension as the usual array of attractive young teens go through their paces of being terrified, hunted and finally butchered by the fearsome leatherface. The final half hour brings to the fore more everyday recognisable villains, in this case in the guise of the local police force. At this point the film effectively switches our sympathies towards leatherface against the authorities, and whilst this last section doesn't quite pack the punch of the first hour it still keeps you engaged. The film has some great photography, including low slung camera angles and overhead crane shots, which add much to the uneasy atmosphere that pervades the film. The editing also skilfully ensures that we are not let of the hook (so to speak). Let's face it this is the sort of film that gives you exactly what it says on the tin and it certainly touches a primal nerve in me.

The cinematography and special effects are amazingly good and the music score and sound stirringly compliment the visuals. Heartfelt performances by Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland add pathos to the proceedings. On the evidence I'm now totally convinced that this wonderfully intense movie experience is as close as I ever want to get to a real Tsunami."" ]"
gangster-squad;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Ferociously edited and directed with some style even if the screenplay is some what suspect. As written here this gangster squad veer between, at best, opportunistic and, at worst, downright inept. The film is always fast moving and entertaining and the production values are excellent. Josh Brolin gives the best performance as the squad's leader John O'Mara. Sean Penn is at his scenery chewing worst as arch villain Mickey Cohen and Ryan Gosling, in an unusually bland role for his superb actor, is rather colourless. Emma Stone has little to do as the obligatory female love interest as is also the case with many well known faces in supporting roles. Still, as undemanding entertainment you can do a lot worse."" ]"
easy-money;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""This is a very disappointing movie that amazingly is made somewhat tolerable by the commanding presence of lead actor Joel Kinnaman. His portrayal of the naive chancer is so deserving of a better film. The story lacks context and focus and is surprisingly quite a drag lacking in any real tension,pace or cohesion. The last 20 minutes or so kick things into high gear, but for a two hour plus film it really is a case of too little too late."" ]"
a-royal-affair;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A Royal Affair is quite simply the best historical costume drama that I have seen for years. This is what one hopes for every time from this type of film and all to often what one gets is the debacle of something like 'The Affair of the necklace'. An unknown (to myself) period of history comes to life in the three areas that matter in a film like this. The acing of the three leads is fantastic with special praise going to Mikkel Boe Folsgaard as the king on the edge of sanity. His performance in a supporting role is the best of this year. The design and costumes are truly beautiful, and last but by no means least the writing where most films of this ilk fall down badly. Not here, however. The story is propelled onwards and upwards by intelligent dialogue delivered with expert precision by the entire cast. At the moment it seems to me that the Danes have cornered the market in quality entertainment, not only in film, but also on tv where their output is also of an extremely high standard of late (Borgen; The Killing; The Bridge to name a few). See A Royal Affair at all costs as it is a gem of a film that has almost slipped by un noticed due to its minuscule release. If you like well acted and beautifully written period dramas about royalty you won't be disappointed."" ]"
world-war-z;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""It's not bad for a zombie movie that has, reportedly, had a troubled production. Marc Forster directs with confidence and energy managing a large cast and the CGI to good effect. Ariel shots of crippled or panic stricken cities are impressively delineated and the mayhem is excitingly edited to within an inch of it's celluloid life, deploying the odd shock tactic to jumpy effect. The film has holes and implausibilities in abundance, but it is never less than entertaining. Two set pieces stand out. One aboard a plane and another, at the film's climax, in a lab. Both are riveting. Sound Design is excellent and the music unnervingly adds tension to the proceedings. In summation it is a lot better than anticipated."" ]"
the-eye-of-the-storm;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Adapted from Patrick White's dense novel, this adaptation is fairly faithful to its source material, but is mainly notable for three strident performances. As an eccentric actor Geoffrey Rush wonderfully conveys much of the humour in the piece. Charlotte Rampling is good as the matriarch of this dysfunctional family playing her at two stages in her life, even though she does tend to pull off the younger woman better than the dying mother. This is purely because she looks and acts too young (she is in fact less than ten years older than Rush playing her son!). Still I do understand her casting as there are not many actresses who look as good as Miss Rampling at nearly 70 who could have had the gravitas to fit the dual role so well. Which brings us to Judy Davis. Her performance as the spoilt daughter is the standout. The way she conveys her character through some amazing facial expressions is just mesmerisingly brilliant. The film on the whole is a pleasant and undemanding entertainment."" ]"
anna-karenina;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Visually sumptious - The production design and costumes are truly beautiful and the film does look a million dollars - this version of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a triumph. Imaginitively and boldly directed within a theatre setting, Joe Wright elicits a good performance from Keira Knightley (who always seems to walk a tightrope between good and bad in her films) and a scene stealing performance from Jude Law as her betrayed husband.  Beautiful and underrated the film rewards an audience prepared to wait for the gradual unfolding.  Knightley certainly gets better the longer she inhabits the character. Another plus is the lush music score by Dario Marianelli which quitely adds volumes to the atmosphere of what is taking place on screen."" ]"
deadfall;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""A car crash, four deaths and a finger sliced off and that's all in the first 20 minutes. Deadfall is certainly not without incident. However, after the first half an hour it all starts to get a little dull despite all the action. It's only when the drama moves into the home of Kristofferson and Spacek that some real tension and emotion is able to spring forth. For the rest of the time the film feels disjointed and lacks any real rhythm. Performances are decent, despite some stilted dialogue, and the snowbound scenario is also good value. On the whole, though, this is just like your average B movie."" ]"

The three leads are not served well by the story or setting and i'm sure in a better focused film they would be considered excellent in their roles. However, that's what might have been. Paul Thomas Anderson seems to enjoy making these long and profound films and whilst I enjoyed 'Boogie Night' and There Will be Blood' to some extent I wouldn't say either of them were completely successful either. Also disappointing was the rather bombastic score. Only the cinematography shines through here. The end result was so what!"" ]"
flight;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""whatever else may be wrong with this film it certainly has nothing to do with Denzel Washington's committed and convincing portrayal of an alcoholic pilot under suspicion for negligence after the aircraft he was piloting crash lands killing six people on board. The crash sequence is extremely well handled wringing out maximum tension.  Once grounded, though, the screenplay introduces us to sundry supporting characters that tend to make the story seem very disjointed. Each scene seems to feel like a tiny vignette filling in the background detail of his life which holds little real interest.. The Introduction of drug user Kelly Reilly also doesn't really add the necessary spark. In fact her main purpose is to show that her road to recovery is a lot quicker than the path Denzel's character chooses. The final outcome is somewhat predictable, but before the cloying reunion scenes with the estranged son, there is a really good key scene where bye Denzel is interrogated by a wonderfully understated Melissa Leo. Here the film really packs a punch, but for most of it's excesive running time Flight just doesn't take off."" ]"
lincoln;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Lincoln is a film of two halves. The first hour and a half is what the term 'worthy, but dull' was coined for. Tony Kushner's acclaimed screenplay seems to be all over the place and, not being an expert on the history, I was confused. However, something rather magical happens when the excellent Tommy Lee Jones takes to the floor of congress to vent his wrath with rivals over the passing of an amendment to abolish slavery. The film comes alive and subsequent proceedings are elevated to a much higher plane. This ensures that the final hour not only engages the brain, but becomes compelling drama. Director Steven Spielberg has dealt with the slavery issue before in both 'The Color Purple' and the extremely tedious 'Amistad' so he obviously has some fascination for the subject. One could, therefore, be forgiven for thinking that he would bring something new to the material. Unfortunately, he doesn't! As with 'Amistad' his direction is staid and unexciting for the most part despite some occasional arty looking set ups. Daniel Day Lewis, on the other hand, inhabits the character of Lincoln to perfection. Not once do you feel it is an actor portraying a character. This Chameleon like actor has pulled off another coup in a performance to rank alongside the very best in his already dazzling portfolio. The film's period detail is beautifully captured and photographed like a series of paintings and Spielberg has, at least, eschewed sentimentality. To this end, though, he is not aided by John Williams' pretty but predictable score, one which I seem to have heard many times before."" ]"
les-miserables;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""It is now nearly thirty years ago that I saw the theatre production of Les Miserables and whilst I remember enjoying it at the time it hasn't remained prominent in my memory aside from THAT song. Therefore, I approached this new film version with some trepidation aware that the first trailer for it had cheated somewhat by editing various images from the film to the aforementioned song. Also with Tom Hooper at the helm, and having been one of  a minority of people who really disliked 'The King's Speech', I was doubly cautious. Gratifyingly all my misgivings are for nothing as the new film is nothing short of magnificent. In fact, the theatre experience is clarified and heightened here. The simple and effective story is propelled along by a stunningly beautiful score (I really didn't remember it being this good), a great sense of period, and committed performances which elicit emotional responses almost constantly. Tom Hooper has done the material proud and is well served by a magnificent cast. Hugh Jackman, it seems, was born to play Jean Valjean over punished for stealing a loaf of bread and then persecuted for ever after by Javert, played by Russell Crowe. Anne Hathaway is stunning and her delivery of the famous ' I dreamed a dream' is truly heartfelt. Eddie Redmayne, likewise, has a revelatory singing voice and also breaks your heart with his sorrowful rendition of 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' sung after his fellow revolutionaries are all killed. Samantha Barks' exquisite voice also has a great solo with the lovely 'On my Own', and Russell Crowe, after a shaky start, also pulls off a couple of songs with great aplomb, whilst showing us a conflicted character always on the edge (literally in a couple of scenes). It seems to me that he has been rather underrated in such exalted company, but he is excellent. Comic relief is provided by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter during their rendition of 'Master in the House'. and only Amanda Seyfried comes over as a bit colourless and insipid. Hooper's decision to let the actors sing live is a very good one and adds to the cumulative emotional effect in scene after scene. Like wise, he opts for close ups when filming the big musical numbers, but he is in no way enslaved by them as the magnificent production design is often shown off to jaw dropping effect. Cinematography too is sublime and perfectly captures the contrasting worlds of the eclectic bunch of characters. The new song 'Suddenly' is slightly below par, and on a couple of occasions the score reminds me of the Lionel Bart musical 'oliver!' but this is only a fleeting recollection as Les Miserables is very much its own musical. At 158 minutes it is a long movie, and in truth there is a slight, if temporary, dip in interest around the 100 minute mark when the young revolutionaries take over the story. However, the big emotion emitted as the film races towards its finale soon puts any negative thoughts to bed. As the credits start to roll you sense the audience members just want to stand, as in a theatre, and applaud."" ]"
django-unchained;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Quentin Tarantino gives us another trademark film which, whilst acknowledging the spaghetti westerns of the 60's, is also a true original. The film has some great writing and is performed with relish by an enthusiastic cast playing colourful characters in a film full of colour in every sense of the word. Christoph Waltz does a sort of reprise of his 'Inglorious Basterds' character but is much nicer here, and Leonardo Di Caprio cast against type plays Calvin Candie with villainous relish. For the most part this is a fun journey. Tarantino definitely subscribes to the notion that nothing succeeds like excess, and bloody excess at that! The film is audacious, humorous, violent and a lot of the time played with its tongue firmly in its cheek. Music, including some fabulous new songs, is also used to perfect effect. It's also a pleasure to see a bunch of character actors from the 60's and 70's popping up in supporting roles to remind us of how good they were, and still are"" ]"

Kristin Scott Thomas (always classy) and Ludivine Sagnier are both great as the sparring work colleagues. Friends, and enemies by turn, they are fascinating to watch as the fabric of their relationship unravels. The first hour of the film is compelling and one is engaged in a story that promises more than it ultimately delivers. Events become more puzzling and rather unsatisfactory however, following the demise of Scott Thomas. All along we know what the denouement will be, but the film is so long winded in getting there that a loss of interest is inevitable. The black and white inter cuts do a good job of clarifying things in the second half and the final scene ends on a high."" ]"

pitch-perfect;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Pitch Perfect is an extremely joyful and funny film full of wit and great dialogue. The jokes spew forth (quite literally on two occasions) at the rate of knots and all performances rise to the occasion wonderfully. Comparisons with Glee are inevitable, but singularly favourable to this achievement (No sequel please). Glee became joyless for me quite quickly (aside from some wonderfully staged musical numbers) and it was also very po faced about issues and story lines (I use this term very loosely as I don't think it really had any ongoing story. It just kept telling us how socially (Ir)relevant it was). Pitch Perfect has no such heavy issues on its mind. It's fun all the way to the closing credits. The choice of music is great and these numbers are energetically staged. Another delight is the banter between Capella hosts John and Gail played with acerbic relish by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, respectively. In summation, echoing a sentiment vocalised by actress Rebel Wilson to a couple of skinnier cast members, this film, like them, has a fat heart."" ]"
arbitrage;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""A second rate entertainment masquerading as an A list movie. Arbitrage is like a routine episode of a low grade tv drama series complete with an ineffectual detective here played by Tim Roth.

The abrupt ending just reinforces just how futile the whole enterprise is."" ]"
the-paperboy;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Watching the Paperboy is a bit like being an observer watching a car wreck. One is inappropriately fascinated by the whole thing. Lee Daniels direction is very uneven (although not without its moments of style), and he seems to subscribe to the notion that nothing succeeds like excess. It doesn't! The film is handicapped from the start by voiceover narration that alienates the viewer quickly rather than getting them involved. The grainy and amateurish photography is also at first a distraction, even though as the film progresses it does seem to fit perfectly with the increasingly steamy and violent setting. Where Daniels has succeeded most is with the performances of his cast. John Cusack is suitably nasty as the killer on death row; Zac Efron perfect as the pretty boy maturing by events surrounding him, and the currently ever improving Matthew McConaughey is just great as the newspaper reporter with a secret. Shining above all these, however, is Nicole Kidman in the role of the trashy Charlotte. She steals the film. Even by her own high standards this versatile and accomplished actress is truly amazing. If the Paperboy was judged soley on the performance Daniels has drawn from Miss Kidman it would certainly be no mean achievement."" ]"
hitchcock;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Comparisons with 'The Girl' are inevitable, but whilst this isn't as good, it certainly paints  in a rather better light. On the whole this is an entertaining and fairly lightweight concoction, performed to perfection. Anthony Hopkins is much better in the role of the famous director than I had been led to believe and Helen Mirren turns in her usual high calibre performance as his wife Alma Reville, the backbone behind the man. The main fun with the film is watching well known actors play other well known personalities. Aside from the two leads, Scarlett Johannson registers well as Janet Leigh, and in a very small role James D'arcy absolutely nails Anthony Perkins displaying all that actors nervous tics and hesitancy. His is a performance I would like to have seen more of. Recreations of the making of Psycho are great and the film generally entertains without displaying any of the heavy drama that made 'The Girl' so compelling. There are merits to each film and both present  in a slightly different way. The truth is probably somewhere in between."" ]"
zero-dark-thirty;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""When Kathryn Bigelow went on American TV recently to address the controversy that had built up concerning the torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, her main defence for the film was that it is a movie and not a documentary. This statement is fair enough in itself, but a movie is first meant to be entertainment and other considerations are secondary. A documentary, on the other hand, is first factual and then hopefully also entertaining. Zero Dark Thirty is for the most part too complex to be easily understood from a historical point of view and, on the whole, to slow too be first rate entertainment. Even the last 30 minutes or so which shows the navy seals storming the suspected hideaway fortress of Bin Laden fails to be either as exciting or as informative as a recent documentary on the subject called ' Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill'. For me this documentary steals Bigelows thunder with its richly detailed reconstructions and dazzling insights into the whole operation. Zero Dark Thirty, unfortunately, never gets to cinematic grips with an unsatisfactory script that whilst not pandering to its audience, nevertheless treats them with contempt by leaving out many more interesting and revelatory details than it puts in."" ]"
parker;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Parker is a very entertaining heist and revenge drama. Jason Statham is in his element here and this is his only other good film after 'The Bank Job'. Muscularly directed by Taylor Hackford and tightly edited the film is a guilty pleasure. Jennifer Lopez doesn't disgrace herself, although she is saddled with some of the worst of the dialogue, and events move at a cracking pace. The opening heist scene is good value and there is a corker of a scene involving a shower curtain, a knife and lashings of blood which is edge of seat stuff. The West Palm Beach locations are also breathtakingly unfamiliar."" ]"
life-of-pi;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Having read the book by Yann Martel and knowing that Ang Lee was at the helm, I was really looking forward to seeing Life of Pi. I thought the film would be visually stunning and an emotional roller coaster and truly expected it to be my film of the year 2012, an expectation encouraged by the brilliant trailer. Therefore, I was very disappointed to realise that the actual movie only partially delivered. The main problem is with the adaptation of the book which many people felt was un-filmable. The novel is good,  not great, but it does present the boy's willingness to embrace all religions in a very entertaining way, sometimes almost comically. The first half of the film meanders from scene to scene giving us no reason to invest in his religious beliefs. Another problem, having read the book, is that the sequence involving the four animals in the lifeboat has been excised from the screenplay to spare us their gory and prolonged deaths. Whilst I'm exceedingly grateful for this on the one hand, it does tend to dilute what the book did so well in showing the true horror of survival. On the positive side the film has a great asset in its young actor, Suraj Sharma, and its visual effects. The storm sequences are the best in the film and Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger, is a great creation. The cinematography too is, on occasion, quite beautiful. However, I am less sure about the 3D. It may have something to do with the cinema in which I saw the film, or just be due to the print under review, but I was constantly aware of a blurring of images on the periphery of scenes. This was not only annoying, but distracting. I had to check my glasses on numerous occasions and it became an issue as the film progressed. Overall Ang Lee does make a good stab at parts of the story, including a couple of emotional moments and when the boy and tiger are alone on the open sea, but it is a case of stabbing rather than sleight of hand."" ]"
oz-the-great-and-powerful;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""Excessive length kills an already verbally challenged storyline. I must confess to not being a huge fan of the land of Oz. There is no denying the classic status of 1939's 'The Wizard of Oz', but recent theatrical productions have either been truly awful (Wicked) or overly familiar ('Wizard of Oz). This Oz fares no better. James Franco is charismatic as the fake wizard injecting both humour and a liveliness into the proceedings, but the film runs out of steam long before the second half. Compensations are to be had with the aesthetics of the film. Costumes, Art-Direction, Visual effects and Make-up are all truly amazing and the film looks the millions of dollars that it probably cost to make. It is probably the best looking film of the year so far. However, it is probably the worst scripted also, and where film making is concerned it is always better to have a good story to get involved with than a visual feast. Both in sync is the ideal. This Oz is basically a boring, but beautiful series of pictures."" ]"

Tye Sheridan is a natural as the boy and Matthew McConaughey must now rank as one of the top 5 American actors in movies today. His performances of late (Killer Joe; Magic Mike; Dallas Buyers Club) Just keep stretching him and he continues to get better and better. The film is so lovingly photographed that you begin to feel the environment. Directed with restraint by original author Jeff Nicholls it is spot on tonally in eliciting pathos. Only some mis judged music at the end rudely spoils the effect of this other wise quite brilliant little gem."" ]"
oblivion;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""The first blockbuster out of the gate is for the most part an engaging sci-fi thriller. An obliterated New York looks great! Photographed and lit superbly, for the most part in muted colour tones, the resultant effect works extremely well. In fact, the film intrigues right up until the true identity of the scavengers is revealed. From here on a lack of clarity in the script, self indulgence in the direction and a surplus of endings that becomes tiresome dilutes the overall effect. The final twist is just one unbelievable plot point too far, given the context of what's gone before. Cruise and, especially, Andrea Riseborough make an effective team. Melissa Leo is again just fab in another of her small, but effective, supporting turns and it is only Morgan Freeman who doesn't bring anymore than his obvious stature to the role. Also, although it is not his fault, it is precisely on his entry that the film begins to implode. Still, if the other blockbusters are half as imaginative and entertaining as this one we will indeed be fortunate."" ]"

There are indeed some laughs to be had but the comedy is totally uneven, as is the story, and ranges from laugh out loud funny to lame, predictable and offensive. There is also a reliance on profanity and coarseness which is tiresomely juvenile. Sandra Bullock works hard, but Melissa McCarthy is beyond the pale with her all too familiar antics again on display. Her character is awful and she is awful. Still, at least she is consistent in her characterisations being despicable and unsavoury in everything in which she appears."" ]"

Not as good as its predecessors, Midnight is so talky that one wishes at times that someone would take a breath. Basically consisting of five major scenes, the airport and car journey sequences see the film off to a promising start only to have it falter in the next, a dinner, which is without question the worst part of the film. Negative reaction sets in here due to bad supporting actors and irritating writing which, whilst trying to be profound one moment and frivolous the next, is just annoying. The heart of the film takes place in a hotel room where disappointments, criticism and recriminations come to the fore. It is in this approximately 40 minute sequence that the film really comes alive demonstrating that despite all attempts to the contrary long term relationships do become jaded and always need to be worked on. Delpy and, especially, Hawke excel here. They inhabit their characters like a second skin and Midnight rises to the expected level which the first hour fails to attain."" ]"

Testimonies lovingly articulated by family and friends bear out that their six year relationship really was one that most people would aspire to. Events following the accident appallingly demonstrate how cruel and selfish the actions can be by the people who purport  to love us the most, our parents!"", """", ""The film is a tear jerker of the first order and so the overly saccharine incidental music that creeps in from time to time isn't necessary as all the emotions are right up there on the screen.

This is not to dismiss it out of hand as I believe it to be a better film than most critics have suggested. The colour palette of the photography is very striking as is the art-direction. Performances are fantastic. In a role that is totally suited to him, Gosling is once again a commanding presence even with minimal dialogue. Kristin Scott Thomas excitingly cast against type is just a knockout.

For the first time I have taken note of Rooney Mara and I honestly don't think Keith Carradine and Ben Foster have ever been better. The star of this film ,however, is the lyrical writing which the actors bring to life exquisitely. The combination of the two makes many scenes totally hypnotic. There is also a pervading sense of  tragedy throughout which is underlined by the perfect and appropriately mournful score. The abrupt ending slightly disappoints but this is actually due more  to  my expectation  than to do with the story not concluding. It could have gone on but that is another story and in effect would make this a different film."" ]"
the-conjuring;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The Conjuring promises more than it ultimately delivers, although an effective sense of trepidation is felt throughout. The film is actually at its best in the first hour before all the camera equipment is moved into the house to photograph unfolding events. Maximum tension is eked out of scene after scene and although these occasionally result in some chilling payoffs they are never to jumpy effect. Great camera movements, considered direction and the main house setting create the right atmosphere and all add to the film's success. Likewise, the music and sound effectively jangle the nerves. It is therefore a shame that towards the end things start to get a tad silly. Unintentional laughs are conjured up when Lili Taylor goes in to full possession and we find ourselves in territory derivative from other movies. This, unfortunately, has the effect of undermining some of the good work achieved during the film's careful build up."" ]"

In fact, she hasn't been this good in years and looks fantastic into the bargain."", ""Unfortunately, with the entry of a rather mis-cast and de glamourised Julianne Moore the film rather deflates. It's obvious that she and Levitt will get together, but this last act which is a shade unbelievable loses the laughs, becomes rather moralising, somewhat judgemental and is actually too simplistically concluded. All of which is a shame because there is so much to enjoy in the film's first hour."", ""Amongst its other achievements the movie boasts a great original score.

There are simply not enough superlatives to praise Blanchett's playing of this wonderfully multi dimensional and complex woman. The last time I can remember seeing such a delightful and off beat female character on screen was way back in 1987 when Holly Hunter presented us with her controlling TV producer Jane Craig in Broadcast News. Another performance to relish. Whether popping pills, talking to herself or rejecting suitors Cate is joyous whilst looking absolutely fantastic into the bargain."", """", ""In all honesty Allen's screenplay, whilst dramatically very good, is not particularly funny. The comedy is elicited by Blanchett's delicate playing and her expressions from scene to scene. Her escape from the clutches of the amorous dentist has to be seen to be appreciated and she makes it laugh out loud funny. There are no two ways about it she steals the show. Sally Hawkins does well in her role as the sister and of the men Andrew Dice Clay registers the best as Hawkins' ex-husband. But it is Cate all the way.

Therefore, it is rather disappointing to report that following this excellent opening we are treated to a film whose first half is so dull and dreary that boredom settles in very quickly. It is definitely not the equal of any of TLOTR films. A perfunctory battle scene and the introduction of the charmless dwarfs do little to up the ante. In fact the real star of the first half of this film is actually the New Zealand scenery and we are treated to quite a lot of it as our intrepid travellers climb up mountain, after mountain, after (yawn yawn) mountain!"", """", ""Still, it's not all bad news as the second half improves considerably.

She plays a single mother who finds love with an escaped convict who holds both her and her teenage son hostage in their own home. Josh Brolin is good as the convict but pitted against Winslet he is some what eclipsed. Flashbacks provide us with the back ground to both these characters and allow us to understand why they are in their current situations, but the movie is best when following the thrust of the main narrative. These flashbacks are, in fact, the least successful aspect of the film being only of sporadic interest. Brolin's past is signposted a mile off and Winslet's isn't particularly revealing."", ""The film does have a nice gentle tone to it which leads to an expected and inevitable conclusion.

The dual backgrounds of life on a decaying earth about 41 years in the future and the alternative safety and opulence enjoyed by the very rich on Elysium is so perfectly balanced that one is completely engrossed in the whole rather than being interested in only half the film. Matt Damon, following on from Bourne, continues to be a good investment as an action hero and Jodie Foster, with an intriguing accent, is fascinating as Elysium's gatekeeper. There are also some wonderful visual compositions and the special effects are sometimes stunning. On the evidence here one can understand why people would want to live on Elysium. The film remains on a constant level throughout due to rapid fire editing and music that adds volumes in creating the gamut of emotions that run through the film. It is fair to say that this is a more conventional movie than Neill Blomkamp's previous one, District 9, but is is also more digestible."" ]"

The writing is so wonderful that at times it feels almost poetic and the actors articulate every word to perfection.

In the lead role as Solomon, kidnapped from his home and sold into slavery for 12 years, Chiwetel Ejiofor conveys with frustration and anger the injustice of the situation in which he finds himself. It is a subtle and impressive performance which culminates in a well earned emotional pay of when he and his family are finally re-united.

The story becomes more unbelievable as it progresses, silly even, and the last scenes are very unsatisfactory. Finally, I was left  questioning exactly what had transpired.

Jim Broadbent and (especially) Lindsay Duncan are utterly convincing as a jaded married couple returning to Paris to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.

I defy anyone who has been married as long as this couple not to recognise themselves in at least some aspects of the fine writing. The compromises, broken dreams, regrets, recriminations, disappointments, triumphs and failures all come under accurate scrutiny and the performers add the nuances that makes the whole thing ring with the sting of truth. This doesn't mean, however, that there aren't some bizarre and unlikely interludes. I really don't think your average 50 year old is going to attempt to do a runner from a restaurant, but these are forgivable and still enjoyable moments in an intelligent, if at times, rather sad tale."", """", ""As an aside, and almost by default, the film highlights how travel and weekend breaks (specifically here) can be fraught and stressful, in contradiction to the fun they are meant to be.

On the one hand one admires some original conceits only to dismiss their unbelievable conclusions within the soft centred predictability of the story's arc.

In addition I had more fun watching the computer games in the film than I did from the film itself."", """", ""Joaquin Phoenix is as good as always and Scarlett Johansson is engaging, for a while, as operating system Samantha, but even she wears thin by the end.

Dig deeper, though, and ths is actually not as original as its surface sheen would have us believe. It's just another boy meets girl, by loses girl, boy meets different girl.

It's definitely not just another popcorn movie but is a very accomplished piece of film making in its own right. The setting and costumes continue to be very imaginative. It has a good story enhanced by tight editing keeping the whole thing extremely tense and compelling, and the effects are special. It has to be said that Jennifer Lawrence is turning out to be a great asset for the series and after this one I'm now anticipating the third with some eagerness."" ]"
the-double-2013;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""The Double is consistently fascinating enough not to be considered a bad film, but is also too frustratingly opaque to be a really good one. Set in a dark futuristic society the film reminded me of both Gilliam's 'Brazil' and Polanski's 'The Tenant'. It is a small ambitious film, Orwellian in tone, in which the production achievements belie its low budget. The cinematography is amazing in depicting atmosphere which in turn compliments the claustrophobically dark sets. The music also perfectly judges the film's mood. Jesse Eisenberg, possibly envying Armie Hammer's dual role in 'The Social Network', now finds himself with a doppelganger all his own, albeit not a twin. He gives a committed performance which is actually quite mesmerising to behold. He is well supported by Mia Wasikowski (who is a lot better than usual)  and an assortment of character actors in very small parts only some of whom are recognisable. I particularly liked Paddy Considine, and it's also good to see Cathy Moriarty again. Director Richard Ayoade adds the occasional eye catching visual flourish and some of the writing is very good, but as a whole the script is as uneven as the film is obscure. Ultimately it fails to be as good as it could have been because one is left somewhat perplexed by it all."" ]"

The young cast are convincingly energetic and Kate Winslet lends her well earned stature to a baddie role even if it is a somewhat unusual choice for the Oscar winner. The plot at times does strain credibility even for this genre and the inevitable blossoming romance between Woodley and James is more of the same. However, for such a long film it is consistently entertaining and for the most part it all works very nicely. Only towards the end do events veer towards extreme conventionality, but by this time one has enjoyed it too much to carp. I think the film critics saw a different movie."" ]"

In fact this Marvel-less movie is a thorough going bore. Aside from a few sequences (involving a lift, and a climatic fight aboard an artillery carrier) most of the action is un excitingly derivative. In between these set pieces we have a lot of waffle spoken in an attempt to build character, but this only extends the agony of an already over long film.

Inside the house are various pets as well as toys that randomly and magically spring to life. The early scenes keep one enthralled and entertained, but by the end the movie is struggling.

hercules;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It all starts so promisingly with remembered stories of some of the famed labours of our eponymous hero. However, after a quick introduction to the man god's background and a whiplash bout of special effects this settles into a training exercise for two rather un excitingly staged battles.

Things do liven up somewhat when the villains are unmasked and Hercules gets to perform his last labour.

calvary;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""There is a lot to like and admire in 'Calvary', not least a compelling opening demonstrating Brendan Gleeson's skill as an actor, and a strong ending with a powerful final moment.

There is no real narrative drive beyond its almost inevitable conclusion. Gleeson is superb as the very human priest under threat of being murdered by a member of his own community. Living with this knowledge and battling his own demons he still carries on with the day to day effort of positively influencing the disparate bunch of characters he encounters on a daily basis. The screenplay, which takes place over the course of a week, examines the differing views on the church; from its hypocrisies, the cynicism of the non believers, to the almost obsessive nature of the converted. It is all served up with a delicious dose of black humour (I love the line ' Friends are enemies you've not made yet') which successfully makes its points without trivialising the serious nature of the film generally."", ""It certainly holds the attention and can also boast a fine supporting cast from which Chris O'Dowd stands out as the local butcher."" ]"

maleficent;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Based on 'The Sleeping Beauty', my favourite of the old style animated Disney Films, this is a credible and mainly satisfying re-imagining of that film's iconic villainess. This version benefits from a refreshing twist in the story's telling and an inspired casting choice in Angelina Jolie to play the malevolent titular character. Eschewing the campy humour that essentially ruined 'Mirror Mirror' and balancing its dark tone much more successfully than 'Snow White and the Huntsman', this latest fairy tale adaptation hits most of the right notes. The film looks great and the visual effects can take their place amongst the year's best. James Newton Howard's score never pauses for breath, but delivers everything that we have come to expect of his lush and sweepingly epic music. Also the narration that accompanies the story is strong and complimentary to the overall style. It's only really the temptation to resort to cutesy humour, as when the three tiny fairies become peasant women, that threatens to topple the film in to the realms of pantomime.

Watching them play the cat and mouse games afforded them by the serpentine twists and turns of a very impressive screenplay makes for enthralling viewing. Director Hussein Amir keeps his camera in close creating an edgy claustrophobic atmosphere, whilst not allowing the gorgeous Greek and Turkish locations to distract from the main drama.

Fine actors John Lithgow and Alfred Molina provide some lovely moments, but in all honesty both have been better. This is rather surprising considering the possibilities these roles afforded them. They come across as just to knowing. Only Marisa Tomei really impresses in what could have amounted to a nothing mother role.

He is usually good, sometimes brilliant, and here what emotion there is he elicits effortlessly in two or three beautiful moments.

However, in the hands of director Morten Tyldum it has, surprisingly, become so much more. Starting with a smart and dense screenplay, which hones in on three different periods of time in the life of code breaker Alan Turing, the story is utterly compelling. Wisely, it has also been told in a straightforward and un complicated manner and after about 10 minutes one gets a dizzying sense that the film is going to be an absolute gem, a feeling that reaches fulfilment 2 hours later as the credits roll."", ""The recreation of time and place has been lovingly captured via excellent production design. In fact, the film is rich in detail. There are breathtaking vistas of war torn Britain which includes shots of bombers wreaking devastation over London and submarines firing rockets, as well as more ordinary depictions of rubble strewn streets and houses. It is also good to see the appropriate use of historic Bletchley Park as a backdrop to where all these events actually unfolded over 70 years ago. The editing seamlessly takes us from year to year without confusion or jarring transitions and the scenes leading up to, and immediately following, the breaking of the code are just thrilling. The music is another plus and whilst not particularly melodic it underscores what is happening on screen brilliantly."", ""Criticism has been levelled at the film for not focusing more on Turing’s sexuality which is as untrue as it is unfair. Beyond seeing him actually bonking we have more than enough information as to the effect his sexuality had on his life and, ultimately his death. Scenes of his childhood also give insight into the man he would become. End titles, unlike the recent ‘Foxcatcher’ are also helpful and informative."", ""Ultimately, the film belongs to its powerful cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation and he brings real humanity to the tortured Turing. Some of his moments, particularly near the end, are almost unbearably moving.  Keira Knightley is almost his equal in a smaller but crucial role. She has real power here as Turing’s one time fiancé, the lone woman breaker who as it turns out is better than the men. Supporting actors Charles Dance, Rory Kinnear and Mark Strong all contribute characters that are more than mere ciphers. Also, it is to the credit of the boy playing Turing as a young man that we believe in the subsequent actions and performance of Cumberbatch."", ""Rarely is a film as all encompassing and engrossing as this one. It is a triumph on every level and a cinematic treat."" ]"

It's an ambitious but flawed venture that is big in concept, big in budget and explores  big themes. Sadly what this all adds up to is a big disappointment. The story, full of as many holes as there are black ones in space, is a mish mash of ideas which never really gel and one never quite gets a hold of what the point of it all is. The actors don't offer much by way of compensation either. Anne Hathaway shouldering the worst of the dialogue is the biggest casualty here, but Michael Caine is also tiresome as is Matt Damon who adds nothing. Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain. The film's biggest asset is her performance, although it's good to see film legend Ellen Burstyn showing all the others how it's done in just one tiny scene."", """", ""The banal dialogue is often gibberish and causes the rolling of one's eyes in disbelief or embarrassment. Nearly all scenes are over extended and often one is inclined to tune out long before they are finished. The special effects are good, but aside from a couple of sequences (a huge wave and the final set piece involving McConnaughey and Chastain),there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The music comes on strong and sounds like an extended version of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' from 1973's 'The Exorcist', co incidentally starring Burstyn in one of her finest roles."", """", ""The sound is very loud and effective during the set pieces, but is then often inaudible during simple dialogue exchanges between characters.

I would have recommended the removal of his power pack."", """", ""Director Christopher Nolan is certainly full of ideas but, unfortunately, they are never fully realised. He comes over like a young boy trying to communicate a passion or a hobby that no one else gets. His direction is over indulgent and left me confused and bored.

boyhood;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Richard Liknlater's unique experimental film about one boy's evolution into adulthood is a long but engaging coming of age story. Shot over a period of 12 years, and calling on the same cast each time, it is a risky enterprise that could have failed in numerous ways. To Linklater's good fortune his cast are uniformly excellent. As the boy under scrutiny Ellar Coltrane acts naturally and even though the story and his character, Mason, are fictional there is a sense that one is watching the real person evolve. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette (so this is where she's been) are totally convincing as the parents 'winging it'. Arquette's rant 'I thought there would be more!' probably mirrors the reactions of audiences who will not warm to the film's general lack of outlandish drama and sudden time switches. Others, like myself, will find these subtle transitions make the picture feel fluid."", """", ""Despite seeming a long watch I don't know where any cuts could reasonably be made to make it more manageable, even though a lot more time is given over to Mason's later teenage years when he is dating and contemplating college. The screenplay, whilst lacking a lot of dramatic incident, has a lot of social/political points to make and Mason becomes the mouthpiece for many of these. At times one gets the impression that what he is saying really represents another, more mature, person's views. However, the writing is intelligent and people of all ages will be able to recognise situations and identify or empathise with the characters experiencing them."", """", ""After his enduring 'Before' series Richard Linklater has done it again in producing a film that, whilst it may not be the masterpiece exalted by the critics, is never the less a unique and ground breaking evocation of one ordinary boy's journey through childhood."" ]"
futuro-beach;3;2;foxgrove;"[ ""A long and slow exercise in tedium, this gay themed film is divided into three chapter headings and set between the differing cultures of Brazil and Germany. The slight story, which had the potential to be so much more never uses dialogue when a visual will do. This is in no way meant as a compliment to the cinematography which is actually just journeyman work. Rather the film is full of so called ‘evocative’ imagery much of which is just pointlessly extended at the expense of anyone actually saying anything. There are endless shots of nothing in particular like the sea, wind turbines, a plane in the sky, seagulls hovering, people walking, people staring, people bonking. Get the picture? Good, because the picture is all you get from this ambiguous and often irritating angst ridden drama. Occasionally a scene threatens to become interesting (chapter 3 promises the most) but before you know it we are back to the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. The gay market is catered for with much shirt less ness and sex, but anyone expecting any kind of relationship to be explored meaningfully are watching the wrong movie. The leads also lack charisma, so by the time the unsatisfyingly ambiguous ending finally arrives, any discerning audience member will already be contemplating what they are going to do next."" ]"

Set in 1981 a year, apparently, where more crime was committed in New York City than at any other time, it is an intelligently written drama that is both thrilling and dazzlingly acted. Oscar Isaac is fast becoming the most exciting and versatile actor currently on screen and I’m sure that other people have noticed the similarities he bears to Al Pacino. He would certainly have been a great actor to have had around in the 70’s, still the most exciting decade for films. Likewise Jessica Chastain, still flying under the radar despite 2 Oscar nominations and countless films to her credit, is at her powerful best here. She may not have as much screen time as Isaac, but she makes every second count in her bid to be ‘deadlier than the male’. Bleak cinematography, low key music and unobtrusive, but firm, direction from J C Chandor contribute to a film of deceptively raw power. A welcome throwback and proof that they do make them like this ‘anymore’."" ]"
wild-tales;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""This collection of six short stories is generally very entertaining but stops short of being truly great due to a couple of the longer instalments (number 4 and 5) over indulging their content. The first 2 stories are really short. The first set on a plane is frighteningly topical, unintentionally echoing events surrounding the recent tragedy in the French Alps. All the tales are about revenge of some sort or another and whilst the film is not often laugh out loud funny there is definitely a rich vein of black humour coursing through its veins. The best of the episodes involves two drivers who get caught up in violence and death following a road rage encounter. This story is very humorous and yet contains a lot of tension. It is undoubtedly the highlight. The last tale concerns a bride and groom who come to blows at their own wedding reception. This episode is also very successful at combining drama with black comedy and despite the story’s arc, which could have come over as really contrived, the episode works marvellously. There is a great use of music throughout and were it not for the over indulgent ‘Falling Down’ sequence and the least entertaining ‘Hit and Run’ episode, these original tales would be worth an 8 of anyone’s ratings."" ]"

Following on from his excellent performances in films like ‘The Hunt and ‘A Royal affair’, as well as his TV outing in ‘Hannibal, Mads Mikkelesen proves once again that he is a commanding presence on screen and an actor one looks forward to watching. High production values across the board and a stunning South African location also make the film both aurally and aesthetically pleasing. However, it must be said that the cinematography is the star of the show. With its vibrant use of colour and the almost surreal beauty of its night time shots the film belies a probable small budget and looks better than most blockbusters ever could. This is a real gem that will reward those who seek out its treasure. Small, maybe, but perfectly formed."" ]"
a-little-chaos;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Initially A Little Chaos bears comparison to a new and unused jewellery box in that it is pretty but empty. As things progress, however, one’s interest is stimulated by a couple of well-played scenes and a dedicated performance from Kate Winslet. She can do a role like this as if it was a walk in the park, or as is the case here, a walk in the garden. Her dialogues with Alan Rickman in particular have a real spark and are quite hypnotic to behold, successfully drawing one into what has hither to been a rather unengaging period piece. The film is generally overly talky rather than literate and the period setting is an unnecessary expense even if the costumes are beautiful in themselves. This is a tale that could easily have been told in a modern setting. At its heart it is basically a romance between Winslet and Matthias Schoenerts who is, unfortunately, not seen to best advantage here costumed and bewigged. He seems uncomfortable in the period setting and his performance lacks the dimension he brought to his role in ‘Suite Francaise’. On the other hand Alan Rickman, as the sun king Louis X1V, is a better actor here than he is a director. Scenes are often lengthy and over indulgent and the film seems to have ambitions above, what is essentially, a small romantic storyline. Supporting performers add colour, although Stanley Tucci is in danger of being typecast as campy and effeminate. Here, as the King’s bi-sexual brother, he makes meals out of witty throwaways. Thankfully, he can be seen at the moment to better advantage in TV’s ‘Fortitude’. Overall the film is disappointing rather than bad, but does afford some pleasures for anyone seeking out fairly light and undemanding entertainment."" ]"
fifty-shades-of-grey;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Arriving as a target to face a probable onslaught of negative reviews from cynical and jaded critics, I decided to view this media juggernaut before passing judgement myself. Not having read the book, and having absolutely no desire to do so, I was still curious as to what the story was aside from containing the odd kinky sex scene. The good news is that whilst it may be a bit of fluff, it’s slick and oddly intriguing fluff that contains two impressive performances, top notch production values and beautiful music that perfectly underscores the drama."", ""The aforementioned sexual content has had critics using the words ‘bland’ and ‘vanilla’ whereas, in fact, for a mainstream commercial film these scenes are actually quite strong. They have been very well integrated into the story and first rate choreography and editing have maximised their effect. Let’s face it this is fluff, not porn, and so this was never going to be ‘Deep Throat’ or ‘Debbie Does Dallas’ and I for one am extremely thankful for it. Also, strangely for a film that is aimed primarily at women, as I’m sure the book was, it has the potential to also alienate many of that gender. I’m sure not all women will be appreciative of Christian Grey’s very singular sexual proclivities."", ""Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have great chemistry together and Johnson in particular is an actress to watch. Dornan certainly looks the part, but his performance is is better in the TV series ‘The Fall’. It’s also good to see Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden in support, albeit in thankless mother roles. Still, this is undoubtedly Johnson and Dornan’s dance and the two leads make the material work."", ""The film also benefits by not taking itself too seriously. Dornan, in particular, seems to be playing Grey with his tongue very firmly in his cheek. One scene in which the two characters partake of a formal Business meeting is very amusingly played out. On the other hand an early bar scene showing a drunk Johnson being rescued by Grey represents the film at its worst."", ""If the film ultimately outstays its welcome it nevertheless has exceeded expectations. It may not be highbrow entertainment, but it’s certainly not torture."" ]"
love-mercy;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""A refreshingly unfamiliar bio-pic which isn’t one of those conventional rags to riches stories so beloved of the genre, but which artistically are more often than not seen it all before pedestrian. This is a riveting, astoundingly well-acted drama concerning the mental illness afflicting The Beach Boys’ singer composer Brian Wilson, a story of which I knew absolutely nothing."", ""The original screenplay splits its running time between the younger Brian, struggling with group responsibilities as his grip on reality loosens, and the older one who is now a physical and emotional wreck in the care of people who really don’t care about him at all."", ""Director Bill Pohlad’s direction is lean and imaginative and through his actors unfolds a compelling story. As the girl who falls for and reaches out to Brian, Elizabeth Banks does some beautifully subtle and understated work conveying much without saying a word, particularly in her powerful scenes with Paul Giamatti as Brian’s unscrupulous therapist. Giamatti himself at first glance seems to be saddled with a clichéd cypher of a role, but the actor’s proven talent brings to the fore a true monster. Dano who is great at playing edgy or slightly off centre characters is in his element here as the younger Brian starting to lose control, but, amazingly, the real revelation is John Cusack as the older incarnation of the troubled singer/ composer. Cusack has often been an actor whose performances have tended to lack colour and shading, journeyman at best. Here, however, he is so much more. In a touching and compelling bit of acting he holds you spellbound whenever he is on screen."", ""The Beach Boys music permeates the film, but the story does not serve as its slave. Also, unusually, there are not any substantial concert scenes of which to speak. These are often perfunctorily thrown in when dealing with singers or groups and it is to the credit of the story that this gimmicky device was not deemed necessary in this particular instance. Period detail, most notably the costumes worn by Banks, is excellent and the sound is great. One of the best films of the year, thankfully, comes out in a summer when the season thus far has proved to be depressingly sillier than usual."" ]"
american-sniper;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""Clint Eastwood applies his typical macho style to this superficially entertaining but cliché ridden war drama. Think of an inferior ‘Hurt Locker and substitute a beefed up Bradley Cooper in place of the slighter built Jeremy Renner. The film’s biggest liability is the screenplay which doesn’t have an original idea through its entire running time. As usual we have to endure the obligatory scenes of boys being boys and their irritating training routines. We watch dispassionately as Cooper’s marriage to Sienna Miller begins to combust as the war and his job as a sniper take their toll. We roll our eyes in disbelief at scenes where Cooper partakes of personal phone calls to Miller whilst at work in the war zone (Would that really be allowed to happen?). The end credits inform us that this is a true story and that the protagonist, Chris Kyle, was killed by a war veteran he was trying to help. Arrogantly, though, we are not privy to any further helpful information like why and how! It’s as if Director Eastwood feels that everyone will have heard of Kyle and know his story. That maybe so in America, but unfortunately does not apply to the rest of the world."", ""On the plus side the film is at least never boring and is actually very well edited. Cooper is very good and Miller, despite being saddled with some truly awful dialogue and the worst written scenes (her first introduction at the bar not withstanding), also acquits herself with dignity. The Oscar nominated sound is undeserving of the laurel, and one scene in which Cooper plays around with a gun in the family home struck me as being dangerously irresponsible in a film which has undoubted commercial appeal."" ]"
the-wolfpack;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""A sobering documentary about a family of seven children (6 boys and 1 girl) who are for the most part confined to their New York apartment by their father in order to protect them from the social horrors of the outside world. The film concentrates almost entirely on the six boys who spend a lot of their time watching movies and then enacting them. Educated at home by their mother, who is also their rock and to whom each bears a great love, they are surprisingly well dressed, articulate and speak intelligently of their years of confinement. As the story unfolds their dislike of their father, and the regime that he has inflicted upon them, becomes apparent. Each boy, although obviously internally damaged, demonstrates an optimistic attitude and promise for the future. Their mother’s heart- breaking recollection of dreams never realised due to lack of funds, contributes to a very sad, but definitely not depressing tale. The father’s reason for his actions can be viewed as a paradox. There is much truth in the fact that the outside world is a scary and dangerous place. However, the damage inflicted on the children as a result of their alternate sheltered and confined existence leaves its own scars. Ultimately, despite the uncertainties evident in life, one has to be given the chance and freedom to find one’s own way. The film leaves you feeling optimistic that the boys’, against all the odds, will do just that."" ]"
southpaw-2015;2;1;foxgrove;"[ ""Southpaw is the title, but very poor is the verdict of this seen it all before boxing movie which is an over long bore. Harvey Weinstein has gone on record as saying that this is the movie that will win Star Jake Gyllenhaal an Oscar. However, Gyllenhaal is so badly let down by a dire script that hangs out every cliché known to the boxing movie genre, that I don’t believe any self- respecting Academy member would allow that to happen. In truth Gyllenhaal is fine, and definitely the best thing about the overwrought melodrama that this is, but his performance is no classic in the making. The film is essentially a paint by numbers exercise where the direction is uneven at best and laboured at worst. Director Antoine Fuqua (now there’s a name to conjure with) prolongs almost every scene beyond endurance. The first half an hour is a lot of talk and the film only starts to get to grips with a semblance of a storyline following a fatal shooting. From here on in cliché follows cliché as the film tries to out- do ‘Rocky’ with no success. Basically this is about a boxer falling from the top to the bottom, losing his daughter along the way and doing everything to get both her and his successful boxing career back to the original status quo. The awful script is manipulative and there are many emotional moments for anyone buying into this predictable rubbish. The scenes with the daughter are squirm inducing, especially the one in which she keeps slapping her father for letting her down. Even the climatic fight is drained of any tension as one knows the outcome due to the obvious nature of the film. Subtlety surprise or originality are nowhere to be found here. The editing also misses a trick and it is rare for a fight scene to be so singularly lacking any tension or power. Overall this is film making at its worst. Commercial, unoriginal and just plain dull."" ]"

xenia;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""It’s a long and uneven road for this amiable but insubstantial story about two brothers journeying through Greece to find the father who abandoned them as infants. Motivated in his quest by the death of his mother, the younger boy Dany (Kostas Nikouli) has his own emotional problems which prevent him from making the necessary transition from child to adult, despite his otherwise confident air as a young gay man. The film explores these insecurities through his pet rabbit Dido and some well delineated fantasy sequences, some of which involve a larger than life stuffed rabbit. The film also tips its hat to Eurovision and the older brother Odysseas (Nikos Gelia) is presented as a really good singer looking to enter a popular talent contest en-route. One particular episode, no doubt aimed at the gay market, shows the brothers singing and dancing in their underwear. This sequence of high camp is too meticulously choreographed to integrate believably here despite the flamboyance of the lead character or the fun it otherwise produces. Political issues, such as the financial crisis in Greece and the immigration problem are also convincingly touched upon. Ultimately, the film is not unlikeable, but it is seriously overlong by at least half an hour for its slim storyline. The climatic meeting with the father is actually very good and creates some tension, as is an earlier meeting with bullies. This sequence results in one of the attackers being shot with the gun that Dany misguidedly carries around with him. The lovely musical accompaniment, often played on acoustic guitar, is reminiscent of some themes from ‘Brokeback Mountain’."" ]"
trainwreck;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""Even though it gets more serious in the not quite as good second half, Trainwreck is that rare bird, a comedy that is actually very funny. Wearing the hats of writer and lead actress, Amy Schumer is great in both guises. Her screenplay is outrageously raunchy at times and surprisingly tender at others. It offers up the opportunities for some wonderful supporting cameos from the likes of Ezra Miller, John Cena and especially Tilda Swinton. Unrecognizable beneath her very convincing make up Swinton steals every scene she is in as Schumer’s viperish boss and is is an absolute hoot! Schumer herself has great comic timing and carries the character confidently and convincingly to the only really conventional thing about the movie, the ending. One is prepared to forgive this, however, due to the copious amounts of goodwill generated en-route by an almost consistently funny movie."" ]"
minions;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""A Hodge podge of ideas are never successfully converted into a totally successful story and this ‘Despicable Me’ offshoot can really only be recommended to Minion fans. The animation is very good and the soundtrack is wonderfully interjected with some classic 60’s songs. Also for the adult movie buffs in the audience there are plenty of references to other films one of which, if I’m not mistaken, is a homage to ‘The creature from the Black Lagoon’? The villain here voiced by Sandra Bullock is the aptly titled Scarlet Overkill. However, the character lacks the sinister villainy of Despicable Me’s ‘Gru’. I don’t wish to be too harsh on the film because there are some truly inspired moments. The early narrated scenes depicting the Minions in search of the greatest villain they can find is a lot of fun as are the scenes at the Tower of London. Unfortunately, though, not being a true Minion convert I watched proceedings rather impassively laughing at only a couple of inspired sight gags. Ultimately, one is left to conclude that this is a film for children or diehard fans only."" ]"

Emerging somewhat damaged from a dysfunctional working class background and optimistically declaring that she was ‘not a messed up person, Amy’s vulnerability, shyness and penchant for cutting remarks tell an altogether different story."", ""The influences of both her husband and father, Blake Fielder and Mitch Winehouse respectively, are here clearly depicted as self-serving negative forces in her life. The former introduced her to the hard drugs that would assist her in pushing the self-destruct button, whilst the former was more concerned about his life style than the well- being of his troubled daughter."", ""Unusually this is not a documentary given over to talking heads. Instead we just hear the voices over filmed footage with titles informing us as to who is speaking and where the action is taking place. It makes for a refreshing change. Also, the brilliant decision to have the lyrics to her songs actually appear on screen as she is singing them adds volumes to our understanding of the singer, her demons and how she coped with them, albeit tragically."", ""Whilst the many unsavoury aspects of her life forces one to acknowledge that she could never be held up as a positive role model, her voice and talent were truly great.

The incomprehensible story basically revolves around the toxic friendship between Elisabeth Moss and Katharine Waterston. They appear to meet up every year at the latter’s secluded lake house to exchange barbs and vitriol, but all in the name of friendship. The tone of the film comes on like some British ‘B’ horror movie of the early seventies complete with heavy doom laden music, but in reality the only horror exuding from this mess is the unfortunate loss of 90 minutes of one’s life. The story negates any interest in the performances and both actresses spout monologues which are sleep inducing. One scene of breakdown actually reminded me of a similar scene in Polanski’s The Tenant, a much better film, however. If all this wasn’t bad enough, in addition the sound is appalling rendering many lines of dialogue, mercifully, inaudible. A total mess."" ]"

Adapted from a novel, his survival and NASA’s subsequent rescue mission makes up the bulk of the story. Incredulity is kept at bay due to an intelligently credible screenplay. Damon holds centre screen effortlessly, but performances are secondary to the visuals as presented by director Ridley Scott. Despite being rather long the film manages to constantly command attention and the last 20 minutes certainly rack the nerves. The writing is peppered with humour and the score is appropriately and memorably fitting. With regards to the 3D format, I don’t think it is essential here, but does the job unobtrusively."" ]"

Ok, so none of it is to be taken very seriously and basically it’s a load of old tosh. However, should one really be clock watching and yawning this much? Tom Cruise is a good action hero and by now the part fits him like a hand in a glove, but I am less impressed with Simon Pegg’s comic turn as his side kick.

Following on from his undisputed acclaim in TV’S ‘Breaking Bad’, he gives a credible account of what Trumbo, or at least his essence, could have been like for the many who wouldn’t have a clue who he was. Helen Mirren pops up as gossip columnist Hedda Hopper ably demonstrating the fun she is having with the role. Her Hopper comes over as instrumental in Trumbo’s downfall and Mirren plays her as evil personified. It’s also fun to see actors taking on the roles of famous faces of the day.

One tends to forgive a lot of the risible dialogue spouting from the mouth of a one dimensional Bryce Dallas Howard as soon as the exciting encounters with the hybrid Indominus Rex gets underway. In fact despite everything else that is wrong with this film there can be no question that the scenes involving the dinosaurs are on the money and trump anything the previous films achieved."", ""Chris Pratt, a good looking and charismatic lead, is not being used to best advantage in movies at the moment what with this and the abysmally over rated ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’. An unrecognizable Vincent D’Onofrio, carrying a few extra pounds, plays the obligatory bad guy without generating any spark of interest and Bryce Dallas Howard is just impossible. Her character is broadly played as if stupidity were an art form. She sets women’s roles back years, maybe even to the age of the dinosaur. It’s also amusing to ponder the continuity problems involving her shoes. High heels one moment.

The music is a bit derivative of other movies.  The quieter scenes are reminiscent of John Williams work for ‘The Towering Inferno’ and at its noisiest the score is just that, a lot of bombastic noise.

Low on thrills but high on blood and gore, including one particularly nasty murder, the film is let down by a pedestrian story and unexceptional acting."", ""The much trumpeted Tom Hiddleston will have to do a lot better than this if he wishes to become one of today’s greats, and the usually reliable Jessica Chastain just doesn’t seem physically compatible in her role. She was actually scarier in ‘A Most violent year’.  Mia Wasikowska fares marginally better but she doesn’t really have to do much more than turn up from scene to scene in another gorgeous frock."", ""Aside from the ravishing visuals in both costumes and Art-Direction, other pluses are a lush and melodic score and some impressive visual effects and make-up. Overall, though, this is a classic case of style over substance. Many scenes, especially those involving Jessica Chastain, come over as campy, eliciting many an unintentional laugh. At two hours, however, one isn’t laughing for long."" ]"
room-2015;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Emma Donoghue’s screen adaptation of her own book is superior in every way to the novel which was told in a style that would not be to everyone’s taste. The story of a young woman abducted of the street and kept prisoner in a garden shed for seven years, during which time she gives birth to a son now five, could have failed on so many levels. Therefore, it is great to report that director Lenny Abrahamson has done an incredible job in finding the perfect visual style with which to tell this potentially small and insular story. In the first half he resolutely refuses to be enslaved by the claustrophobic confines of the room itself keeping the camera up close a lot of the time on the faces of his actors, trusting in their ability to keep the viewer engaged. Precise editing and interesting camera angles also help the film achieve a seamless fluidity that one never dreamed could be possible from reading the book."", ""The actors are outstanding. Brie Larson makes her biggest impact ever as the mother prepared to sacrifice all for her son and, as the boy, Jacob Tremblay is just magnificent. That such a mature and natural performance has been achieved by one so young is truly astonishing. It is fair to say that in lesser hands the quality of the film would have been compromised without his level of performance. The success of the film ultimately hinges on the believability of the child and young Mr Tremblay delivers in spades. Joan Allen pops up as grandma adding fireworks to one scene in particular, but William H Macy is totally wasted. The film is on occasion genuinely moving without being overly manipulative, although the lovely score does play some part in this. It is easy to see how it won the audience award at Toronto as I’m sure most people who see it will love it."" ]"

steve-jobs;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Set backstage at the time of three different product launches in as many years: -1984; 1988 and 1998, this overly literate take concerning events in the life of the iconic Steve Jobs suffers from a screenplay that seems too pleased with itself by half. Divided into three acts, encompassing each year stated, the film feels theatrical in its presentation right down to the fact that most of it does actually take place on, or around, a stage. After a while all the talk begins to feel like reading a book that lacks punctuation. For the first two acts the more it plays, the more it pays in diminishing returns. This is due to the constant and rapid verbosity which, because the corporate musings don’t always seem clear, has the unfortunate effect of causing one to tune in and out as the interest wanes. Things improve decidedly in act three. Here director, writer and actors find synergy in three stand out scenes, where some humanity comes to the fore after having been noticeably absent in acts 1 and 2.  As if the film is aware that it is a talk fest we are also often treated to scenes of the actors walking (and talking) down corridors."", ""If I have some issues with the script, which is also at times brilliant, there are no such reservations with the actors. Having appeared in two films this year (Macbeth is the other) in which his performance has been better than the movie itself, Michael Fassbender is a knockout. It matters not a jot that he doesn’t look like the real person, as his chameleon like ability to get under the skin of a character stands him in good stead. It is the essence he brings to the part that one feels. Kate Winslet is also fantastic in a larger role than anticipated. She appears de-glammed, human and without any affectations of a star.  She is again wonderful."", ""If ever a film could be considered mixed in its achievement it is this one. Disappointing it may well be, but by the end it does sort of win you over."" ]"
legend;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""There are two very good reasons to see and appreciate ‘Legend’ and they are both Tom Hardy. His dual performances as the Kray twins is nothing short of sensational and he is magnetic in both roles. Aided by some seamless camera trickery he often appears as both brothers in the same frame. Unlike Director Peter Medak’s ‘The Krays’, which came out in the early 90’s, this film concentrates first and foremost on the brothers themselves rather than building the story around their mother Violet. Here this is well and truly Hardy’s show and Violet is relegated to a very minor role in the story. Even the fine supporting cast are generally over shadowed by Hardy’s tour de force performance although Emily Browning, as Ronnie Kray’s mentally unstable wife Frances, impresses by effectively communicating her character’s fragility via understatement. She also serves as the movie’s narrator."", ""The film looks great with outstanding production design depicting the East End of London during the 60’s. Many hits of the period pep up the soundtrack sharing musical duties with a surprisingly melodic original score. Only the sound seems a tad off in the early stages, but this probably has more to do with the cockney accents of its cast rather than bad mixing by the sound department. As if to confirm this, after about half an hour one’s ears begin to attune to the dialect being spouted. There in after one is able to totally surrender to the film’s vice like grip."" ]"
the-danish-girl;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""Tom Hooper’s highly anticipated ‘The Danish Girl’ was eventually greeted rather indifferently by the sniffy critics who ultimately only seemed to appreciate the lead performances. Hooper seems to have come in for a lot of critical wrath since winning an Oscar for his least enjoyable film, ‘The King’s Speech’, and both his subsequent movies ‘Les Miserables’, and now this seem to have as many detractors as fans. The former group leaves me head scratchingly perplexed at this negativity as both films are beautifully conceived and marvellously acted examples of what cinema is all about. ‘The Danish Girl’ is a fascinating and, despite its two hour length, a concisely told and emotionally complex true story about transgender pioneer Lili Erbe. The film is a gorgeous prestige production from the beautiful locations in Paris and Copenhagen, through its breath taking production and costume designs, right down to the top notch performances of the two leads. Fresh from his Oscar winning success last year in ‘The Theory of Everything’, Eddie Redmayne is again very good. However, it has to be said that he does somewhat over do the coyness of the emerging Lili and, even at this early stage in his career, certain mannerisms and gestures are becoming quite identifiable within his repertoire. It is also unfortunate for him that in both his Oscar winning role and now here he has been somewhat overshadowed by his leading ladies. Felicity Jones stole the show in ‘Theory’ and a revelatory Alicia Vikander almost single handedly rains on his parade here. She runs a gauntlet of emotions and is heartbreakingly compelling. She becomes the film’s focal point and its soul without unbalancing the drama. Hooper’s direction is assured and there is a brevity in the editing to keep the pace interesting without seeming to trivialise or rush the complex and important story being told. If all this isn’t enough to make you squeeze out the odd tear then Alexander Desplat’s beautiful score will complete the task."" ]"
creed;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""A late offshoot from the popular ‘Rocky’ series of the seventies and eighties. It has some nice touches in both the writing and directing departments, but otherwise it’s pretty much the tried and trusted formula from the better examples of the series. If you are not a fan then the lack of originality and the seen it all before feel won’t convert you. The screenplay draws from the perfunctory elements as before- the no one becoming someone; the training; the obligatory girlfriend; the rousing music and the climatic fight. It’s all here folks and if you like this sort of thing, then it’s the sort of thing you’ll like. Performances are adequate for the demands of the material, but none are Oscar worthy so don’t believe the hype. The climatic fight sequence packs more than a few punches and truly gets the adrenaline racing helped no end by some brilliant editing."" ]"

The train ride to, and through, Zootropolis needs to be seen a few times to fully appreciate the sheer beauty and imagination of the place. The animated work here is sublime."", ""If ever a film had a signpost invisibly displayed for a sequel then this is it. With its various kingdoms and variety of animals already set up, there is ample room left for an in exhaustive amount of story possibilities.

macbeth-2015;4;3;foxgrove;"[ ""There’s nothing wrong with Macbeth that losing the Shakespeare wouldn’t put right. Whilst I appreciate that there are many who hold the Bard in reverential esteem, I personally am unable to include the acclaimed playwright’s medieval prose amongst my cultural delights. I think it’s fair to say that line for line a clear understanding of his work and specifically what is actually being said here, is questionable to say the least. If a modern film had its script spoken in such a flowery and oblique manner it would be accused of pretentiousness. Sure, one gets the gist of what’s going on, but from interpretation and study, not from this as a stand-alone movie. Clarity is never a strength with Shakespeare and this version doesn’t escape the inherent problem. Polanski’s 1971 take wasn’t great either, but it was simpler and overall more digestible as a film."", ""The writing aside, however, this Macbeth does have much to commend it including a raw vitality which is present in all other aspects of the production. The direction and editing are stridently confident and the film benefits enormously from the casting of its two leads. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard must be counted amongst the best actors to appear on screen in the last 10 years. Fassbender, in particular, commands attention and it is to his credit that one watches him intensely even though the dialogue he is spouting leaves one cold. His scenes with Cotillard are mesmerising, even if her Lady Macbeth is otherwise sketchily interpreted."", ""Production design and costumes are also just right, as is the cinematography which is the true star. The end battle scenes are just gorgeous to behold. I don’t mean to declare war on Shakespeare as his stories are basically sound. It’s just a shame about the way he told them. Unfortunately, it is in the particular style of the telling where this potentially good film struggles, unsuccessfully, to get out."" ]"

Whilst I wouldn’t have particularly chosen to use the phrase myself, its inclusion is pertinently apt given the film’s surprising failure. As the saying goes if the cap, or in this instance the bag fits, wear it! Based on true events it lacks both drama and laughs. Maggie Smith can do this kind of role in her sleep. She is a wonderful actress and a great British institution, but there is nothing new in her characterisation here that she hasn’t done many times before. Alex Jennings actually gives the best performance, well two actually, in a dual role that sees him uncannily impersonating Bennett as both the person and the writer. Only in the film’s final act does an element of pathos creep in to stir the interest, but it’s far too late in the day to stave off one’s overall disappointment and apathy."" ]"
the-revenant-2015;6;5;foxgrove;"[ ""Leonardo DiCaprio suffers with grim determination in this long and brutal story of betrayal, survival and revenge. However, this very physically demanding performance does not wow as it should. The almost total lack of dialogue for the character results in viewer alienation and a lack of empathy. One watches the horrific events unfold, but with a dispassionate detachment and some distaste. Director Alejandro G Inarritu creates a wonderful atmosphere environmentally. The locations, beautiful but forbidding, are awesomely captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki whose work here is just stunning. The film is worth seeing for his achievement alone. Also many scenes have a visceral quality to them, none more so than the Indian and bear attacks which both happen within the first half an hour and are excitingly and shockingly staged. Visual effects for the bear are incredibly good. After this events meander from one bloody scene to the next leaving one somewhat anaesthetised to the grisliness of it all. Suspension of disbelief is also a requirement in accepting just how quickly DiCaprio is back on his feet after his mauling by the bear, let alone scaling mountains (one sequence shows him at the top of a mountain unable to walk; the next scene shows him drinking from the lake below!). In support, Tom Hardy also disappoints, but this is once again mainly due to a vocalisation of his character that is often unintelligible. As we all know DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar here, and there is no denying that he is a deserving recipient. It’s just a shame that he will be rewarded, as happens all too often by the conventional and short sighted Academy, for this performance over one of his previous more deserving roles."" ]"
a-bigger-splash;9;8;foxgrove;"[ ""‘A Bigger Splash’ is a hypnotically stunning achievement. Stylistically and directorially very much in the same vein as Director Luca Guadagnino’s earlier and equally impressive ‘I am Love’. This new film also stars a gorgeously costumed Tilda Swinton as rock star Marianne Lane, currently on a getaway with boyfriend Paul (Matthias Schoenaarts) following a throat operation. Their idyll on a Sicilian island is shattered by the arrival of an old flame Harry (Ralph Fiennes) and his daughter Penelope (Dakota Johnson). Based on the 1969 film ‘Swimming Pool’, this is a film about writing, acting and style. There are no dramatic action set pieces. It’s just four people taking life easy in gorgeous surroundings and becoming ever more intertwined by the complications of their own lives and personas. Psychological and sexual tensions abound and looks and gestures keep you totally entranced as to where the boundaries end and when the breaking points will come. The playing of the cast is superb, especially Fiennes and Swinton. Despite the limiting device of having her character unable to speak for much of the film, Swinton nevertheless effortlessly conveys the required emotions through her facial expressions. Schoenaerts, and especially a flirtatiously seductive Johnson add volumes to the atmosphere and audience investment. They not only provide the eye candy but give the story its palpable sexual charge. Best of all though is Fiennes. Walking an acting tightrope as Harry, he nevertheless gives a carefully modulated performance which at first has one fearful that his character will be played way over the top. This initial reaction is very quickly quelled however, and with many very difficult scenes focused solely on him, Fiennes brings this brash and obnoxious character breathtakingly to life. It has to be amongst his finest work. The film itself is definitely worth seeking out. It deserves your time and money more than something like ‘Triple 9’ or ‘Batman vs Superman’ ever could."" ]"
the-jungle-book-2016;8;7;foxgrove;"[ ""From its wonderful opening as the camera draws back from the Disney logo into the magical Los Angeles created Jungle, one has a positive feeling that the film is going to be something special. It doesn’t disappoint. In fact, it is actually a lot better film, story wise, than the mythically lauded 1967 animated cartoon version which is remembered more due to the strength of its musical numbers. Director Jon Favreau has done a fantastic job here in creating both a visual treat, keeping things fast paced and snappy in the set pieces, as well as honing in on all the major characters and keeping them in sharp focus. As the man cub Mowgli, Neel Sethi may not have to flex his acting muscles a great deal, but he at least keeps the character sentiment free and believable, which is in itself no mean achievement for a child actor. Voices for the animals are uncannily good especially those of Scarlett Johansson as the snake Kaa; Ben Kingsley as black panther Bagheera and Bill Murray as the celebrated Baloo. Best of all, though, is the Shere Khan of Idris Elba which is sheer magic."", ""As already mentioned the set pieces are fantastic, but in know way unbalance the rest of the film. Particularly impressive are the opening scenes of Mowgli training; the encounter with Kaa; Mowgli’s snatch by the monkeys; the mudslides and the climatic fire. All this is well served by CGI work that is just stunning and, if reports are to be believed, was all filmed in Hollywood’s concrete jungle far from anywhere ‘GREEN’. The cinematography is also beautiful and the 3D adds immeasurably on this occasion to the labyrinth of grass, trees and caves that make up the landscape. Be sure to stay for the end credits where the book itself is opened to add yet another inspirational touch to a very accomplished film that everyone can enjoy."" ]"

It concerns three young burglars who find themselves terrorised by the blind man they are attempting to rob in a desolate Detroit neighbourhood. The film offers up the usual jumpy moments and tension is maintained, but it lacks the real primal force of a ‘Wolf Creek’ or ‘You’re Next’. One sequence where all the lights go off is effectively shot and there is one genuine surprise to be had at around the half way mark. Overall, though, it achieves what it sets out to do. It will be interesting to see if the somewhat open ending unfurls into the hinted at sequel."" ]"

This is a real curio of a black comedy that has a perfectly cast Kate Winslet returning to the small Australian town of Dungaten after being banished as a young girl for a murder she may, or may not, have committed. The town’s people constitute a strange and eclectic bunch. Amongst the saner residents are Liam Hemsworth as the obvious handsome suitor and Hugo weaving as the police officer with a secret, also responsible for sending Winslet’s character away. Best of all is scene stealer Judy Davis as mad Molly, Winslet’s mother with a secret or two of her own. She is great, tossing off witty or acidic throwaways with consummate ease. The film is genuinely funny and taps into the black humour wonderfully, a rare achievement in itself. The costumes and music are divine and the general tone of the film hits its mark. Unfortunately, it does go on a tad too long which is detrimental to the overall impact."" ]"
the-magnificent-seven;5;4;foxgrove;"[ ""Despite its classic status the Original 1960 ‘Magnificent 7’ must be one of the most over rated films ever made. This new version does nothing to re-ignite any interest in a story that is basically simple to the point of non- existence. As with most film’s one starts watching optimistically, but after a promising but tried and trusted set up one begins to lose interest as Denzel Washington goes off in search of the other titular six. From here on in there really is not much here to pique the imagination. The film drags on for a good hour before finally letting rip with a half hour battle to save the town that is truly exciting and very well staged. The cinematography is the true star and the locations are breathtakingly gorgeous, but the music, half of which is credited to the late James Horner, is inappropriate and lacking strength for such a testosterone fuelled movie. It’s a pretty score, signature Horner in fact, and unobtrusive but it just seems out of place here. The film also would seem to have no right to its title being far from magnificent in its scripted characters. It is actually a misnomer. These characters don’t display anything resembling magnificence, a few of them even ending up as corpses. Most of the actors lack any kind of screen presence or charisma (Washington not withstanding) and the whole enterprise resolves to be a so-so affair. Magnificent? No. Just average."" ]"
deadpool;7;6;foxgrove;"[ ""The opening titles sequence of Deadpool makes the heart sink in dreaded anticipation of yet another mindless marvel movie. So glory be then for a film full of wit and invention that is not a slave to its visual effects. As the masked superhero Ryan Reynolds impudent charm and intuitive delivery of the sharp and, at times, salty dialogue is spot on. Likewise, his asides direct to camera are delightfully amusing, as are the copious character and movie references. In fact the quips come at such a whip cracking pace that on occasion one’s brain can’t keep up resulting in a gag here and there being missed. Some of the dialogue aims for low brow audience appeal, but even here Reynolds manages to save the day with his astute delivery and innate understanding of how to play to the camera. The adult certificate seems to have freed the film from the usual trite situations and juvenile humour that often derails the PG friendly movies, whilst also allowing the film makers not to stint on the sex and gore. Predictable situations are played out unpredictably and it’s fair to say that what we have here turns the super hero movie on its head even if it does seem a little too pleased with itself on occasion. Technically the film delivers the package expected. The editing is fast and furious and the sound blasts you full throttle with every explosion or gunshot unleashed. Music fits nicely into proceedings and there is also some well-chosen pop on the soundtrack. All in all it adds up to an enjoyably slick experience complete with a manageable running time. Let’s just hope that whoever get their hands on the sequel don’t ruin a potentially fresh franchise by dumbing down what we have here."" ]"
la-la-land;10;9;foxgrove;"[ ""La La Land is that rare movie that starts at the top and then goes on and up. At a time when musicals are not at all fashionable this one knocks it out of the park on all emotional and aesthetic levels. It is without question the best film of the year. An audacious opening song and dance number on an L A freeway sets the tone and here is where audiences will either embrace it or leave. Those who stay will be treated to one of those transcendent experiences that are all too rare in today's cinema. Who knew that Emma Stone could be this good demonstrating a range, and a voice, that takes one completely by surprise. Wonderfully supported by Ryan Gosling, the pair effortlessly create chemistry usually not seen outside a lab. Their renditions of a clutch of memorable songs are dynamically performed and stunningly choreographed. Stone's dulcet tones singing' Audition- The fools who dream' is heartbreakingly evocative and succeeds in raising the hairs on one's arms and neck. In fact the score and sound make the film seem like a throwback to an earlier age as does the gorgeous colour cinematography. Technically, every aspect of this unique entertainment has the wow factor. Emotionally the film is very well grounded with its biggest flight of fancy taking place at the Griffith observatory. Director Damien Chazelle trumps his achievement on 'Whiplash' by triumphantly reviving a moribund genre. That he has produced such a dazzling and accomplished piece of cinema in the process is no small feat. If this doesn't win best picture and actress at next year's Oscars (it will of course be loaded with them) then the Academy members themselves must be living in La La Land."" ]"

The musical numbers are extremely well staged especially 'Be my Guest' and 'Gaston' and camera work is imaginative. Luke Evans is a revelation here as 'Gaston' and his charismatic turn more than compensates for the shortcomings of Emma Watson's Rather listless Belle. She fails to impress either musically or dramatically. However, the film is so surprisingly entertaining and breathtakingly beautiful to look at that even her limitations can't derail the overall impact. The score is lovely, although the new songs are not up to the standard of the original ones, and production values -Design, costumes, visual effects, make-up and sound are all on the money.

Audie was the most decorated soldier of all time. He survived the war but died in a plane crash at age 45.  Brad Pitt's portrayal very much resembles Audie Murphy's.

This movie is just plain fun but totally by the numbers as it shows the gamesmanship in the War Rooms as General Manager's & Coaches livelihood is affected by the decisions they make.  The players are just pieces of meat with a certain shelf life.  The sad part is everyone gets paid except the diehard fans who have to suffer with bad decisions by management and the players whose only purpose is to be a free agent mercenary.as in Show Me The Money.  The higher they're drafted the more money and security they get.  I wish I could say there was some suspense in the movie but the truth is you know what Kevin Costner is going to do 15 minutes into the movie.  Diehard football fans will enjoy this.  Anyone else not into pro football don't waste your time.  As for the ending it is preposterous as no number seven pick is ever worth what they traded it for.  The only thing better would have been to see how the players drafted turned out.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with draft.  Just another propaganda piece for the NFL."" ]"

The slowly developing story pulls on your heartstrings as a the cutest 4 YO little boy survives a near death experience in the operating room.  He then slowly starts to tell his father he was in heaven, had an out of body experience, and describes what he saw.  What is lacking is a detailed account of that experience as there was so much more that could have been presented.  It's certainly a feel good story that we all want to believe.  The true life hero is now a teenager and was recently interviewed by Bill O'Reilly.  Once again he spoke in a narrative summary without giving specific details as he was totally unconvincing.

I just loved him as a ballplayer. I guess growing up in NYC, the melting pot of the world, we really didn't know about racism. As time went by I did come to understand the great sacrifices he made and the greatness of the man. He is so deserving of his number being retired. If memory serves me correctly Leo Durocher was suspended for being associated with known gamblers, not women? It was Gene Hermanski, not Pee Wee Reese, whom said all the Dodgers should wear number 42. And as inconceivable as it seems, it was Branch Rickey who said you should trade a ballplayer a year too soon rather than a year too late. He traded Jackie to the hated NY Giants in 1956 8 years after he broke the color barrier in 1948. And Jackie hated the NY Giants so much he retired rather than ever wear any other uniform but for his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers. Jackie then went to work for Chock Full Of Nuts Coffee and became an executive. His widow Rachel is one of the classiest ladies ever!

No questioning his passion for the job but the truth is baseball without a hardcap is a flawed product in which 99% of the times only the big markets can win!  Nice acting but otherwise the movie is going nowhere.  It is never explained why he is such a troubled soul?  I would have loved to see his life unfold.  What is the definition of insanity?  To do the same thing over and over and to expect a different result.  Billy can find talent but has no chance of ever keeping it the way the current state of affairs is managed under Bud Selig.

secretariat;4;4;fantasy;"[ ""This could have been a great movie if not for Hollywood turning Secretariat the horse into a full blown version of Rocky. Poncho Martin trainer of Sham, Secretariat's arch rival \""Secretariat is going down\"". Folks it never happened. Secretariat was the BEST racehorse that ever peered thru a brial. His accomplishments are virtually unmatched by any horse present, past or future. Why Hollywood filmed the Belmont Stakes at Keeneland and show horses racing on poly turf not dirt is beyond me. For anyone to think that any horsemen would start a fire in a wastepaper basket in a barn surrounded by hay, or that the trainer would say he was afraid to hold the horse as he is out to get him is pure Hollywood. And do you think any trainer would hand a multi million dollar thoroughbred to an owner to give a sponge bath? Basically this is a good family movie in which the outcome is known from the moment the movie starts. John Malkovich portrays a Hall of Fame trainer in Lucien Laurin and plays him as a joker for comic relief. Lucien was a great trainer and is nothing like that. As for Diane Lane she is always lovely to look at. She does her best to portray Secretariat's owner who took on a male dominated sport. What the movie fails to show is the price she had to pay with her family to achieve success. But then again this is a Disney movie and only Happy Endings are approved. My recommendation is that if you are unfamiliar with Secretariat you can feel comfortable in taking the family to see it. But if you are a true horse lover or horsemen you are going to be very disappointed. Secretariat the horse is just a supporting character in a movie that should have been about him.â"" ]"

Rather it's an accurate portrayal of a real life family coming together to sit shiver at the death of the patriarch {the father}. We are soon drawn in remembering that when we were young, our fervent hope was to have a royal storybook marriage like the lovers in the fictional Camelot. Despite our best intentions, life never turns out that way. Think JFK and Jackie? Secretly, we all know deep inside that our own childhood family was dysfunctional; but never realized most families are too. We just journey thru life meandering for answers that never seem to come. This film is absolutely outstanding as it reveals a real family warts and all. The ensemble cast are all fantastic, especially Jason Bateman {the central character} and Adam Driver.. The latter is the youngest of the siblings, the one in our family that never seems to grow up that we all envy. As the story unfolds, you can't help but see yourself. At times, it's painful to watch, but dead on accurate. The movie will stir your emotions as you can't help but think what if each of us had taken that other fork in the road? This film will not thrill critics as they live in their own snobbish world, however it will resonate with the movie going public. We all wish we could have \""do overs\"" in life, but unfortunately, as we know all too well, there are none.

Murray plays a Senior Citizen where life has beaten him to a pulp. As a result, he's turned his back on humanity. He's a totally broke down on his luck gambler, alcoholic, deadbeat, liar, buys sex, thief, and is short tempered.  Not exactly your typical Saint.

He teaches him about life and never to settle for ordinary.  Murray's character hides a secret which explains why he's become this miserable old person. Melissa McCarthy plays it straight as the mother of Oliver {the boy}.  She is outstanding in a supporting role as she demonstrates she can really act besides just doing comedy. The entire ensemble cast is just terrific. The movie continues to build until it finally reaches its crescendo. If you have blood pumping thru your heart you should really enjoy this movie.

why-him;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""James Franco is raunchy, but sometimes he's so over-the-top, that his films start out funny, and half way through it's just not that funny anymore. When you use your best lines and dirtiest bits in the first half-hour, an hour later, you're hard pressed to out due yourself. The writers of Why Him? tried to combat this problem, by taking Franco's large than life personality and combining it with the dry humor and physical comedy of Bryan Cranston, and the results were mixed. It's holiday season and Stephanie Fleming (Zoey Deutch), wants her parents to meet her new boyfriend, only she doesn't want to tell them anything about him before hand, because if she did, they probably wouldn't come. They are quiet, reserved suburbanites from Cleveland, and he's a dot com millionaire from California, who loves anything new and unusual. As the two sides of Stephanie's life combine, hilarity ensues or at least it's supposed to. Bryan Cranston and surprisingly young Griffin Gluck had the best lines, and were involved in the funniest moments of this film. As for James Franco, once again, he was too much and he has to realize that every comedic role he takes isn't Pineapple Express. The role here calls for eccentricity, not raunchy and stupid. Right from the start and all the way through, every other word out of his mouth was **** and every stunt he pulled was more immature than the next. It takes a lot away from the film, especially the ending, which was just ridiculous and simply doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The bottom line, the story is interesting, Bryan Cranston is always great and Griffin Gluck was a riot. The film definitely has it's moments, but every time you think it's about to turn a corner, Franco shows up to drop a million F bomb, talk about his penis, and preform stunts better left to the stoner movies."" ]"

In 2014, the Marvel Studios original came out of obscurity to set box office records, introducing fans to a cast of heroes who aren't exactly your typical superheroes. Combining amazing special effects and comedy, the film quickly gained a cult following and critical acclaim, but can they defeat the biggest enemy of all, the curse of the sequel? The Guardians are back doing what they do best, with a new enemy on their tail, when they crash land on an uninhabited planet. Their rescuer comes in a form of a man who seems too good to be true, is he really there to help them or does he have something else in mind? The story in volume two is not as good as the first one, that was to be expected, but luckily it isn't far off. The characters are the same and this time they know each other a whole lot better, meaning the chemistry is better, the humor comes more quickly, and the magic is still there. Once again Chris Pratt is outstanding, it's still hard to believe he went from the annoying jock on Everwood to this charismatic megastar. The rest of the cast is also on it's game and we learn much more about the characters then we did in the first film. While not being as strong story wise, this film certainly hits closer to home, and everything is amped up from the special effects to the humor and even the soundtrack. I love these films and I hope there are a lot more of them, however I'd be remiss in not sharing my thought that something this good, especially with how the story evolves in the second film, is better suited for a weekly TV series than at most a handful of feature films.

bad-santa-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Despite advertising to the contrary, Bad Santa 2 is not bigger, badder, or funnier than the previous film. In fact, this time they went too far and broke the cardinal rule of comedy. The film goes too far to be as raunchy and funny as the first film, that unfortunately it goes from funny to stupid and by the end, it becomes a farce of itself. In the sequel to this classic comedy, Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is just as broke and drunk as he ever was, and this time he's saddled with a twenty-one year old Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly), who just won't leave him alone. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his old pal Marcus (Tony Cox) is released from prison, and has a job that promises to make them all rich. A reluctant Willie agrees, only to find out the place they are going to hit, employs his worst nightmare, his mother. I was hoping this film would be even half as good as the first one and it certainly does have it's moments, especially when Brett Kelly is involved, but overall this movie just isn't that funny. I don't know if it's because they put it all on the table in the first film and the jokes were just all done, or if it tried too hard, but the laughs just didn't come as easily. I mean how many times can Willie curse at a kid on his lap or make short jokes about Marcus? At least it wasn't just the same film with different names and places, but the jokes are similar, the personalities have changed very little, and I really didn't laugh as much as I hoped that I would. Bad Santa 2, wasn't a bad movie, maybe I was just spoiled by the pure genius of the first film, but I really didn't think it was anything more than your ordinary run of the mill comedy.

doctor-strange;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""At this point anything with the name Marvel attached to it, is box office gold, as is evident by their latest film, Doctor Strange. The Doctor is perhaps one of the least known out of all of their characters, yet he is still pulling in huge numbers. The big question is whether or not the film lives up to the hype, and I can honestly say, I'm not really sure. Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a world renowned surgeon, who is badly injured in a car accident. When modern medicine fails him, Strange starts looking for alternative treatments and finds a bizarre ancient group, that claims they can teach him how to heal himself, and do a whole lot more. The big appeal of this movie, at least for me was the special effects. I knew the effects would be good, but Marvel really out did themselves this time. I watch close to three hundred films a year, and I'm not often impressed by special effects, but the effects in this movie really blew me away. That being said, this is just one of those film you have to shell out the extra money to see in 3D. It's a completely different experience in 3D and you really will be amazed by some of the things they can do. As for the story, it really is the same thing that Marvel keeps doing over and over again. I've really enjoyed the Marvel films and while they are all unique in their own way, the underlying theme always seems to be the same. Someone gets hurt, they lose the girl they love, they find someone or a group of someones who help make them extraordinary, then they fight the bad guys and in the process get the girl. It's a formula that is in every single one of their films and it's getting a little tiresome. The bottom line, Doctor Strange is pure Marvel. What I mean by that is, it's the expected story, with unique traits specific to this character, a Stan Lee cameo, a cast full of superstars, two scenes after the credits, and perhaps the best special effects you'll ever see. If you're a fan of these films, you won't be disappointed by Doctor Strange."" ]"
logan-2017;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Many people have asked why the name Wolverine isn't in the title of the latest X-Men movie. The reason is that this film is not for children. Logan is violent, vulgar, and disturbing, this film will give your kids nightmares. Logan is supposedly the last time Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine, it might also very well end the current X-Men film franchise, that has produced nine feature films and brought in billions of dollars. That being said, I expected an epic conclusion, the likes of which Marvel had never done before, and what I got was somewhat of a disappointment. It takes place in the future and yes, Logan is older, but he's still the Wolverine, so I was expecting a fair bit of fighting and chases, but it seems that was pretty much all this film has to offer. A deteriorating Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) claims that even though a new mutant hasn't been born in decades, he is speaking to one that needs help, and as it turns out he was right. Logan and Prof. X go to rescue the child and bring her to safety, while the government tries to stop that from happening. I get that this is the future and there isn't time to fill us in on everything, but there are some major plot holes with the story that are never explained. This may be a Wolverine movie, but it is also the conclusion of the X-Men, so what happened to everyone and everything else? The stories narrow focus is on these three and getting to their destination, with chase after chase and fight after fight. The film certainly has it's moments and more than it's fair share of F bombs, but where was the whole conclusion element to it? The epic end to one of the biggest franchises in the history of film just isn't there. The big draw seems to be that they finally went for the R rating and showed Logan's true personality and yes, they made the film much more realistic than any other X-Men film, but I didn't have that satisfied feeling when it was all said and done. As for Hugh Jackman, this was easily his best performance as Wolverine. You see his real personality and all that comes with it, and if this wasn't the type of film that it was, released when it was, I truly believe people would be talking about an Academy Award, he was really that good. The harsh reality is that X-Men as we know it, with the cast that we know is probably over, but the way they ended it leaves us with too many unanswered questions and a feeling of unfulfilled promise."" ]"

I can't tell you how long I waited for this movie to come out, it was at the top of my must see list for months, and I was more excited to see this than almost any other film this year. For those unfamiliar with the story, five thousand passengers are in suspended animation for one hundred and twenty years, as they prepare to start a new life on a brand new planet. Thirty years into the journey, there is a malfunction and two of the sleeping pods open, awakening two of the passengers ninety years early. Everything I read and saw made this look like THE film to see this year, but the truth is it was beyond boring. This malfunction that awoke them, was part of a cascade failure, meaning small failure got worse over time, years in fact, and nothing serious actually happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. Until then, it's a lot of talking, romance, sadness about how they'll waste their lives alone on this ship for nothing. This had to be why the studio paid two of the best young actors in Hollywood a ton of money to be in this thing, because they knew no matter how boring the story or bad the reviews got, people would still go to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Congratulations Columbia Pictures, it worked, you made your money on this one and yes the special effect were cool, but how many people were actually entertained by this film?

In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special, I mean to take nothing away from her or her performance with this next statement, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't point this out. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the \""main\"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month."" ]"

Out of those films some big stars emerged, many of which are still hanging in there making movies today. However, in recent years a new crop of action star has emerged, one that is more charismatic and more of an actor than just simply a big guy. One of the most exciting of the pack is the star of London Has Fallen, Gerard Butler. After surviving a kidnapping attempt in the thrilling, Olympus Has Fallen, President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) won't go anywhere without Mike Banning (Butler) by his side. Despite a lot of chatter, the pair travel to London for a world summit, where terrorists plan on doing a lot more than talking. They plan to distract the high police and military presence by attacking the city, thereby leaving President Asher vulnerable to assassination. So if I'm understanding this correctly, blowing up half of London will distract the U.S. Secret Service enough to leave the U.S. President vulnerable? This is why nobody watches action films for the story lines. We watch these movies to see the incredible moves, the gratuitous violence, the unbelievable special effects, and of course that catch phrase we all know is coming. Gerard Butler stars and he just gets better with every film he is in, as his technique and style remind me so much of a young Bruce Willis. Let's just hope that M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make him shave his head and turn him into a zombie as well. Assisted by a cast of veteran award winners the likes of Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, and Angela Bassit, this film doesn't just have the moves, but it has the star power to back it up. The story here is absolutely ridiculous, but when it comes to a great action film, who really cares? London Has Fallen has everything you could ever ask for from an action movie and it's star is only continuing to rise."" ]"

At 73, with over one hundred films under his belt, is it really that surprising that Robert De Niro is bored and looking to try something new? In reviewing his credits, he's never been in what one would call a raunchy comedy, and for it what it's worth, he was outstanding. De Niro plays a man who has just lost his wife of fifty year, and is looking to reconnect with his Grandson, and of course get laid. After tricking his Grandson into taking him to Florida, the two wind up at Spring Break in South Beach, where the hilarity begins. De Niro's grandson is played by Zac Efron, who took a while to lose the teen idol label and find his niche as the awkward, but lovable guy in these extreme comedies. Their two characters are so different, that just bringing the personalities together is enough to make things funny, but when you throw them into ridiculous situations together the laughter is off the charts. Personally, I am someone who has found some of the most classic comedies of all time to be a waste of time. Humor is something I enjoy, but not something that I understand easily, and I found Dirty Grandpa to be one of the funniest films, I've ever seen. You will not believe just how raunchy it gets or the lengths De Niro is prepared to go to in order to get some good laughs at his age. I too was thinking this film would be \""okay\"" at best, but I was wrong, and so are my fellow critics. Dirty Grandpa is hysterical and those who are avoiding it due to bad reviews and similarities to other films, are really missing out."" ]"

For some he stands as a symbol of why people need to fight for equality, for others he opened their eyes to the horror and abuses that people go through every day simply for being different. What's easy to forget however, is that first and foremost, Matthew Shepard was a human being. Shepard was a friendly, kind, outgoing, young man from a small town and there in lied the problem. In a town of a few thousand, Shepard stood out and everyone knew who he was and what he was. One night, a couple of drunk rednecks decided to mess with him, it went too far, and they killed him. This film, isn't about that though, it isn't one of the many films about the symbol that Shepard became or the fight for equal rights his story ignited. This is a film, by a long time friend of Matt's, who simply wanted the world to know about her friend. Michele Josue interviews Matt's brokenhearted family and friends about his life, from childhood up until his untimely death, and weather your gay or not, weather you respect gay rights or not, you can't help but feel for these people who lost such a bright, loving, artistic person, who made everyone around him just that much better for knowing him. It's a terrific documentary and I was very happy that for once, a documentary focused on the life of the man instead of the tragic way that he was killed."" ]"

Twenty years after the original Vacation, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) wants to relive his vacation to Wally World with his own family, and as expected, nothing seems to go as planned. Helms was truly hysterical and in my opinion easily outshines Chevy's performance in the original film, but Helms isn't the only star of note in this film. 11 year old Steele Steebins almost steals the show as Kevin Griswold. From beating on his older brother to his perfectly timed one liners, this kid was absolutely hysterical, and has a bright future ahead of him. Together with Helms and a classic story this movie had me laughing so hard, there were tears in my eyes. Often times when companies decide to remake classic films, they are little more than a farce of the original, but in the case of Vacation, the remake overtake the original by leaps and bounds. Simply put this is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple of years. I thought it would be good, but it went far beyond all expectations, and is now our latest must see movie!"" ]"
american-heist;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""It isn't fair and it isn't right, but in the minds of many moviegoers, certain performers will always be associated with their most memorable roles. For me, Hayden Christensen will always be Anakin Skywalker, and it's strange to see him in anything but a Science Fiction film, but that doesn't mean he's not capable of playing anything else, as he shows in American Heist. Christensen plays James Kelly, an man who became an ex-con, for simply looking up to and trying to help his older brother, Frankie (Adrien Brody). As James is getting his life on track, Frankie is being released from prison and is of course looking for one big score. Now, James has to decide what's more important, keeping his new life on track or saving his older brother. Hayden Christensen gives an admirable performance, once you get passed the initial shock of Anakin cursing and covered in tattoos, but it's Adrien Brody who steals the show. Brody isn't an Academy Award winner for nothing, as his character pulls at the heart strings and has you running the gambit of emotions. Everyone knows someone like Frankie and wonders which way they'll turn out. In this case, there is also the added incentive of finding out if he'll drag his brother along with him, either way. American Heist isn't the best film out there, the story has been done, and at times, it's a little dull. This film is more about the characters and their values more than anything else. There's a fair share of language and guns, but unlike many other thrillers, that's not really the focus here, which in the end, is appreciated."" ]"
strangerland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Set in the Australian outback, Strangerland tells the story of a family that has recently relocated to a small town that is literally in the middle of nowhere. The move seemed like an odd choice, but as you will later find out, it was a necessary one, but needless to say no one is particularly happy about it, especially the families two kids. One day there is a report of a large dust storm headed towards town and the parents go to get their children to safety, only to discover they are nowhere to be found. The local sheriff is called in, but he's not moving fast enough for the father, so he takes things into his own hands, further complicating things. Aside from the unusual setting and circumstances of the disappearance, this film isn't all that original, in fact, except for the ending and the location, it was really very similar to the film, Prisoners. The investigation was fairly interesting, as was the setting, Hugo Weaving was good as the sheriff, but was really the only interesting character with any kind of personality or background of interest. As for the rest of the cast, they're kind of just there, they don't talk much about themselves or their past and the film has an extremely narrow focus. Nicole Kidman just cries a lot and Joseph Fiennes wants to yell at anyone who will listen, which unfortunately is us. The bottom line, Strangerland is an average, forgettable film, it has enough going for it that it will keep your attention and it moves at a decent pace, but the characters are nothing to write home about, the performances are nothing special either, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand what's going on or what happened in the end."" ]"

On one hand, the producers wanted to make an epic film like Lord of The Rings, so there are crazy sets, ridiculous customs, awesome special effects, and even a narrator, but they also wanted to make the WOW geeks happy too, so there are realms, clans, portals, kings, wizards, betrays, and if you've never played the game it's all very confusing and more than somewhat boring. The story is complicated, but to sum it up, an evil wizard has destroyed the Orcs home world, so he has opened a portal to the realm of the humans, where the Orcs think they'll have an easy time taking over, but didn't expect the humans to have a magic Guardian. It's a film of fighting, gibberish, and non-sense that I'm sure the gamers loved, but I didn't, I fell asleep. As for the cast, well, I guess the filmmakers spent all their money on the effects and costumes, cause there is really no one of name in this film, and some of these people honestly wouldn't have been cast in their high school plays. Some of the actors were so bad, I think they agreed to do this for free, just to have a major motion picture on their resume. The bottom line, I saw it for curiosity and I'm sure a lot of other people will too. The special effect were really cool and it looks terrific in 3-D, but the story is confusing, it's just one crazy fight after another and there really isn't much of a point to the whole thing. If you're going to see it, go see it in 3-D. It makes the effects look cooler and if you fall asleep, the people you are with won't notice and won't bother you."" ]"

Gilchrist is an exceptional young actor, who always gives his best, but without that big role on his resume, he's forced to take jobs like this one.

To make matters worse, his parents are away for the summer and Daniel is all alone. As boredom ware away at him mind, Daniel starts to see things and wonders if he's being punished for his crimes by some supernatural entity, or if he's just going insane from boredom. For much of this movie, the actor is bored, and if the actor is bored, what do you think the audience is feeling? Daniel's days are filled with monotonous discussions with friends, who sneak over, and of course investigations that turn up nothing. As for his nights, they are filled with a lot of jump scares and loud noises that again ultimately turn up nothing, as Dark Summer is just one of those films where nothing happens until the last twenty minutes, and by then, who really cares anymore? The bottom line, even a great actor couldn't save this film, it's your typical supernatural horror film, filled with a lot of jump scares, good looking people, and a whole lot of nothing else until the very end."" ]"

Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom. It's a pretty cool idea, but after you get all the information in the beginning of the film, it turns into one big chase. That's it, a back and forth hunt, with no real substance, dialogue, or anything more than explosions and gun shots. The cast was excellent and if they had focuses more on the technology and the scientific aspects of it, the film would have been awesome, but instead it's just another plain, boring, shoot out."" ]"

Supremacy is one of those films that is ripped from the headlines, telling the incredible true story of Garrett Tully, a white supremacist who was out of jail for less than twenty-four hours. Tully (Joe Anderson) was released on parole, after spending most of his life behind bars. He was on his way back to the white supremacist strong hold he called home, when he and his girlfriend are stopped by a policeman, a black policeman. It doesn't take long for Tully to jump out of the car and kill the officer, before going on the run. The pair makes their way to a suburban area, where they break into a house and take a black family hostage. Aside from the obvious tension of a hostage situation, there is also extreme racial tension, that makes the whole situation that much harder for the people involved. As events play out, something miraculous starts to occur as Tully, starts to sympathize with his hostages. Danny Glover stars as The homeowner, Mr. Walker, and was beyond phenomenal. Glover excels in films that involve race, because he has this quiet simple way about getting his message across. He's never over the top or in your face about it, he's just a simple man who states the truth, something most people easily relate to. Aside from Glover's performance and the obvious question about what's going to happen, this film was a dud. There is a lot of waiting around, racial slurs, and arguing before we get any answers we seek. Supremacy is basically a film you start to watch, and would like to turn off, but you can't until you find out what happens. My advice, Danny Glover has plenty of other similar significant roles under his belt, and you'd save a lot of time and frustration by simply googling Garrett Tully."" ]"

The town is out for blood, but only one of them, literally, as soon after the accident, the mine owners teenage son turns up dead. Little Accidents is yet another example of these dark modern noir type films, that have become so popular the past decade, and normally I am a huge fan of them. This film however, may have had the modern noir feeling, but actually had the old noir story line AKA slow, strange, and confusing. I chose this film because one of it's stars is Jacob Lofland, who at just 21 years old, has only been acting for 5 years, but he is a natural in every sense of the word. Every performance he has given has been better than the one before it. His talent has lead him to leading roles in the Maze Runner series, as well as the AMC show, The Son. Being as fond of his style as I am, I decide to go back and watch his filmography from the beginning, and that's where I found Little Accidents. While Lofland's part was minor, you are still able to see some of the skills that brought him to where he is today. Paired with Elizabeth Banks and Josh Lucas, this was one fantastic cast, featured in a terrific setting, and I was sure this film was a can't miss, but the story had other ideas. Little Accidents was all over the place, some of things that happened have nothing to do with the story, and make little sense. The Bottom Line, don't let a terrific cast fool you, this film is slow and all over the place. The mystery, isn't much of one and the story will leave you scratching your head."" ]"

Knowing their best chance to catch him is Lake, they turn to him for help, but can he keep it together long enough to complete his mission? This unbelievably was a b-movie, yet a remarkably strong performance for Nicholas Cage, who randomly had to go between C.I.A. legend and confused old man. His performance is aided by the late Anton Yelchin, playing an analyst who admires Lake so much, that he goes against orders to help him with his mission. The whole dynamic between the man at the end of his career on his last mission, and the boy at the start of his career on his first mission, really added something different, that you don't typically see in espionage films. Dying of The Light really does have a lot to like about it, but one must remember, it is an espionage film and a direct-to-video one at that. The writing isn't spectacular and parts of it are more than somewhat confusing. They also throw in a lot of Evan's flashbacks and delusions at the completely wrong times, which really did start to bother me as the film got more intense. Overall, I did enjoy this film, I thought the acting was terrific, and I loved the dynamic and chemistry between the two leading men, despite the obvious age difference. Dying of The Light certainly isn't a perfect movie, but it's still an entertaining one."" ]"

Most of these films are based on true stories, and are as real as it gets, but sometimes, no matter how amazing the story, it doesn't necessarily make for the best cinema. 23 Blast is one of those films, as it tells the inspirational true story of Travis Freeman (Mark Hapka), a star High School Football player, on his way to a College scholarship, when a rare illness struck him blind. For many High School students, football is just a means to popularity, but for Travis, football was his whole life. His illness left him devastated and almost killed him, until miraculously, with the help of an unorthodox coach and supportive teammates, Travis was able to play again. The story here is almost unbelievable, and while it would make for a terrific episode of ESPN's 30 for 30, I found it severely lacking in content for a feature film. 23 Blast is the directorial debut of actor, Dylan Baker, and while he does a great job of telling the story and inspiring the audience, there just isn't enough story here to keep people interested for a full ninety minutes. The film focuses a lot on Travis's depression and rehabilitation, while a key component of the story, it also takes up a good majority of the film. If one were to shorten those scenes, there wouldn't be enough for a full length film. As for the young cast, they turned in surprisingly strong performances, in particular Mark Hapka, was excellent, but in the end it all comes down to this. 23 Blast, while inspirational, also moves extremely slowly, as it keeps coming back around to a single focus, Travis's illness. There is no deviation from the main story line, and things continue to go around in circles, until the last half hour or so when they finally get to the point.

Logan Huffman stars and fails to follow up on the success he had in his debut film, Underdogs. In that film, Huffman looked like he would be the next big thing in Hollywood, but playing a dim-witted character in a somewhat anti-climatic story didn't do him any favors. He is paired with Jeremy Allan White, better known as Lip, in the hit series Shameless. I was hoping to see him open up and show some range with this role, but the truth is he was just playing the same character, a highly intelligent young adult who makes poor choices. As far as the story goes, it was pretty interesting, but there are too many breaks in the main story, which distract you from the big picture. There is a lot of discussion and strains on the groups friendship, which pop up at the absolute worse times and pretty much stop the film dead in it's tracks. Bad Turn Worse really did feature a pretty good story, with a ton of up and coming young Hollywood talent. It's very appealing in many ways, but also disappointing in others."" ]"

There's absolutely no spontaneity, like when Harry chucks the salt over his shoulder or Lloyd puts laxative in Harry's tea. That's not the only issue here, as the bad guys are kind of the biggest joke in the movie and Lloyd finally crosses the line from cute to creepy. The bottom line, I loved seeing Carrey and Daniels together again and I enjoyed the parallels to the first film, but aside from a few misunderstandings and a line here or there, this film isn't even close to being the film fans waited twenty years to see."" ]"

It almost started a war and made world headlines for almost a week, still it lost money, and is considered to be one of the biggest flops in recent history. In The Interview, the hottest duo in comedy, Seth Rogan and James Franco team up for their third feature film together. This time the pair play a TV talk show host and his producer respectively. Their show is like a combination of Maury and TMZ, and is considered by most in the media to be a joke. Wanting to change that image, the team decide to get in contact with the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, for his first televised interview. Once announced, the duo is contacted by the CIA, who wishes to recruit them to take Un out. The first time I saw Rogan and Franco together was in Pineapple Express, and I thought it was one of the funniest films I'd ever seen. They have terrific chemistry and I expected great things from them in the future. It might have something to do with the fact that their characters are always so similar, but the more I've seen them together, the less impressed I've been. Seth Rogan is kind of annoying to begin with, especially that chuckle of his, but it's usual balanced out by Franco's extreme behavior. In the Interview, this dynamic didn't work, as Franco's character and portrayal was even more annoying than Rogan's. The cameos may have been impressive and so was all the attention this film received, but the truth is that many of the jokes were amateurish, and the film was a giant step back from Pineapple Express. When people work together, especially comedic duos, the films are supposed to keep getting funnier and more outrageous, but Rogan and Franco seem to be going the other way. The Interview isn't a great story and it isn't that funny, in fact, it's more frustrating than anything else. I love both Seth Rogan and James Franco, they've both given me hours of quality entertainment, but sadly enough, I can't add the Interview to that list, as it's bark was much worse than it's bite."" ]"

This time however things did get a little out of hand, as one can see by the enormous cast in the movies poster. the Expendables added something this time around that the other two films were severely lacking in, comedy, whether it was intentional or not. Included in this were how Barney's team had to be bigger than ever to fight the baddest guy of them all, Mel Gibson. Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger taking part in a machine gun battle from a golf cart, since they obviously can't run anymore, and they even managed to sneak in a joke about Wesley Snipes being in prison for not paying his taxes. New editions included Kellan Lutz, Kelsey Grammer, Ronda Rousey, and various other UFC personalities, leading to a lot more hand to hand stuff than in previous films, but much like the other films, the third installment of the Expendables was an action junkies dream come true. There were non-stop explosions, gun battles, and bodies, all surrounded by a very thin and improbable story. We don't watch these movies for the story or even the characters, we watch these films simply for the adrenaline rush. In that context alone, Expendables 3 hits the target every time, but if you're looking for a good story, great performances, or even a reason behind the madness, then you're watching the wrong series. When it comes to the Expendables think less Die Hard and more Michael Bay."" ]"
life-of-crime;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""The plan was simple, kidnap a rich suburban woman, while her husband and son are out of town. The husband is corrupt, so he will be more than willing to pay a ransom, in order to keep them quiet, and to get his wife back, right? This group of bumbling, life-long criminals thought they had it all figured out, except for one small problem, Frank Dawson (Tim Robbins) isn't really interested in getting his wife back. This strange film, based on the novel, Switch by Elmore Leonard, takes place in the late 70's, and had critics raving, but after seeing it for myself, I'm left with one question, why? After the kidnapping takes place, the film moves at a snails pace, with criminals arguing, and phone calls back and fourth, nothing happens for the majority of the film. Jennifer Aniston stars and gives probably the worst performance I've ever seen her give. She is this spoiled, whiny, rich **** who just doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut. It really got to the point where every time she spoke I cringed. On the other hand, Tim Robbins, who plays her husband, was hilarious, but not in the film nearly enough. One of my favorite young actors, Charlie Tahan, also has a role in the film, as their son. In the brief amount of screen time he has, we see a very troubled and confused kid, an angle that could have helped the story, but he too was hardly used. The majority of the film features Jennifer Aniston interacting with her kidnappers and trying to form a bond with the bumbling idiots. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or just a comedy of errors wrapped up in a dramatic theme, but either way it doesn't work. Most of the cast is absolutely horrible, the majority of the film is unbelievably slow, and the parts that aren't, just don't make a whole lot of sense. Life of Crime had quite a few side stories that could have been utilized to fill up the space and break up the monotony, but it was all left on the cutting room floor, leaving us with a film that could be used as a method of torture at Guantanamo Bay."" ]"
the-prince;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Paul (Jason Patric) is a mafia hit-man in New Orleans, and with a baby on the way, he wants out. Paul thinks the only way to do that is to kill his boss (Bruce Willis). With a car bomb in place, Paul waits for his boss to leave for the day, but is shocked to see the bosses wife and daughter get into the car instead. After the tragedy, Paul and his family flea and for 18 years, live in peace, but that all changes when his daughter goes down to New Orleans for a weekend getaway and disappears. The dry, emotionless, Jason Patric stars in this film and as it turns out, he's perfect for the role. As The Prince, the heir apparent, Patric has to play both a loving father and a ruthless criminal and does so admirably. While he's listed in the background, he really is the star of the movie, with the other big names making sporadic appearances. It's a shame, because Bruce Willis's boss character seemed to be a really interesting guy, who I'd have loved to see more of and learn more about. The Prince isn't very unique and you can't help but draw parallels to A History of Violence. While not as good, the film still features some intense action and a great story. The one draw back is that the Prince is so focused on this man Paul, and his goals, that they ignore some very compelling side stories. Had I been the writer, I would have utilized flashbacks through out, to show more of the prince and the bosses story, but sadly they didn't. Aside from that I really enjoyed the film, it was a chase, a mystery, and a mafia film rolled into one, with some great cameos, and an unexpected ending. This is the kind of action film I'd love to see more of. It isn't simply about the special effects and the guns, there is a purpose behind all of it, and that makes all the difference."" ]"
good-people;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I saw this movie 4 years ago when it was called Ca$h, but that was a comedy and this was a thriller, still it's amazing just how similar the two films are. Good People and Ca$h are so much alike, that I don't know how the producers of this film didn't get sued! Good People takes place in London and focuses on another young couple down on their luck. They're about to lose everything when their downstairs tenet dies and they find a bag of cash in the ceiling. Much like the couple in Ca$h, they face the dilemma of keeping the money or turning it into the police. Of course they have to keep the money for there to be a film, but shortly after, the rightful owners show up and want their cash, leaving the couple on the run. James Franco and Kate Hudson play the young couple and to my surprise, despite their very different styles, they had great chemistry, but that's really all this film had. It's very hard to review a film that is so similar to another, because I find myself unimpressed by the second film and wonder, if I hadn't seen the first, would I have enjoyed the second? As far as thrillers go, it wasn't much different or better than you'd expect it to be, despite the big names in the cast. Ultimately, Good People isn't a bad film, but I preferred the story in a more comedic form with Sean Bean playing a foul mouthed, wise cracking gangster. If you're a fan of any of the cast members, you should see this film, because it definitely wasn't boring, but it really wasn't anything special."" ]"
radio-free-albemuth;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""From Philip K. Dick, the mind behind the Terminator, Blade Runner, & Total Recall, (just to name a few) comes one of his most abstract and best reviewed novels, Radio Free Albemuth. Since being released in the early 80's, Science Fiction fans and literary scholars alike have analyzed it over and over again. They seem to think there is a deeper meaning, but to me the meaning of the story is simply that every single person can make a difference and change the world, if they are inspired to do so. Radio Free Albemuth is Philip K. Dick's biography, only in an alternate universe. Dick is a Science Fiction writer and the narrator of the film, who tells the story of his friend Nicholas Brady  (Jonathan Scarfe). Brady is an ordinary guy who one day starts receiving visions of the future. Most people think Brody is crazy, especially his wife, until all of his predictions start to come true. Brady moves his family to L.A., where he becomes a record executive and that's where the story really takes off. The world these people live in is a police state, cause by the hysteria brought on by terrorism and The Cold War. Brady comes to realize that he is the key to changing the world for the better. All he has to do is find out how to do it and who or what is instructing him to do so. The alternate Phillip K. Dick, played admirable by Shea Whigham, is a witness to the events and makes it his mission to chronicle the work of his friend. Like most writers, Dick was known for being more than a little eccentric and many have questioned where this story came from, and weather or not Dick believe he was experiencing the same types of messages that Brady was. As for the film, it is just so well done, and I've always love stories that take place in alternate realities. The story is as much political as it is scientific, and when you throw in the inspirational message that anyone can change the world for the better, you've got one hell of a story. From beginning to end, the cast is terrific, especially the mysterious Sylvia, played by Alanis Morrisette of all people. I knew she was in Dogma, but I had no idea just how good and actress she could be, isn't it ironic? Radio Free Albemuth has everything I look for in a movie and then some, and it is written by one of the best there ever was, I can't possibly recommend it enough."" ]"
sex-tape;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""From the cast and crew that brought you Bad Teacher, comes Sex Tape, and on the surface it had all the makings of the next big comedic hit. Many people were saying that Sex Tape could be the next Hangover, as it is an original idea with an all-star cast, but sadly it falls well short of expectations. Annie & Jay's marriage has become a little stale, so one night they decide to spice things up by making a Sex Tape. Jay is a music producers and inexplicably neglects the fact that his laptop is connected to many other devices, and the tape finds its way to the cloud. Once again, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz have absolutely no chemistry. They are too different types of actors that just don't compliment each other and they are even less believable as a married couple. If that were the only issue with this film, maybe I could have gotten passed it, but the real problem, as with Bad Teacher, is that the writers don't know their audience. This is an R rated film about a sex tape and in no way meant for children, yet the jokes are on a sixth grade level. As an adult going to see a raunchy comedy, I'm not interested in jokes about erections and diarrhea, it's in very poor taste and isn't something many adults will respond to. This film is supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, but there was barely even a snicker in the movie theater, which basically tells you all you need to know about this film. Sex Tape is trying to get people to see it under the guise of being raunchy and featuring some pretty attractive stars, that fans hope they will get to see naked. The truth is that it is very amateurish, you really don't see all that much, and the jokes could be out of PG movie. All in all, Sex Tape is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time."" ]"
x-men-days-of-future-past;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""I love science fiction and I hate superheroes, but I credit the X-Men series with giving me an appreciation for them. X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \""old timers\"" and the \""new class\"" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!"" ]"

MacFarlane plays Albert, a sheep farmer, who has a reputation for being a coward. After backing out of one duel, he is forced into another, after falling for a woman he didn't know was married to a psychopath. With Seth MacFarlane, you know there is going to a range of comedy from ingenious to low-brow, but this recent film is completely the latter. It is impressive that he got such a large cast to star beside him, but unfortunately they all have very little comedic experience and it shows. Writing, Directing, Casting, and Starring in a film is an admirable feat, but it is completely wasted when the film is a stupid as this one. If your film is going to be rated R, why not go all the way with it? If you take out the sheep fornicating and the fowl language, A Million Ways To Die In The West, is nothing more than an awful kids movie, full of potty jokes, and misleading heroes. The story here is very simplistic and half the time it's not even funny. The parts that are meant to be humerus, turn out to be little more than jokes for the young teens that watch Family Guy. When I saw this film, I was hoping for another unique MacFarlane comedy, like Ted. That film was hilarious and extremely unique. By comparison, A Million Ways To Die In The West is about fifteen minutes of content, and an hour an half of complete and utter nonsense. I suspect some of the big stars in this cast wish they could remove this film from their IMDB page, because it really was that bad."" ]"

That all changes when a decade later his daughter goes missing. The gloves come off and McGuire connects with his old crew and goes after old enemies to find his daughter. This was an entertaining film, but I think it would have been so much better if it were less violent. I love violent action films as much as the next guy, but the story here calls for a more investigative approach, but all McGuire wants to do is beat people for answers. Nicholas Cage stars and is one of those action stars that never goes out of style. He's been going after the bad guys and surviving impossible odds for nearly three decades, becoming very good at it. Despite being an independent film, Rage has a huge cast with many notable names that really help the story along. In fact, with all the named actors in the film, I'm really surprised that Rage wasn't released in theaters. While being entertaining, Rage isn't anything you haven't seen before, as it's your typical who done it, with all the gun fire and explosions you'd expect from an action movie. The cast is experienced and very good, while the plot does have a back story and moves at a reasonable pace. Rage is one of those film where you don't really have to think and ultimately it is somewhat forgettable, but if you're looking for something to watch without having to think too much, than Rage is a perfect choice and it is currently streaming on Netflix."" ]"

I however disagree, as it is both highly original and highly imaginative, but set in a very odd location. When global warming has become too much for the planet, top scientist create a cure, a new chemical that will stabilize the planet, however there is a miscalculation leading to a global ice age, which kills off most of the planet. Earth's remaining inhabitants are left stranded on a single luxury train that is forced to continually circle the earth. I understand that this train was a billionaires dream and has this state of the art engine that will last for decades, but why a train? I'd think if the world was ending, these people would put their money into an underground civilization or some super generator for the worlds largest building, because too me, a train doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When the engine fails, you're dead and if the ice causes a derailment or an avalanche crushes the tracks? There are so many things that could go wrong with this idea, that it's virtually impossible, that for 18 years, nothing has gone wrong. Captain America, Chris Evans stars and he is really terrific. I can't believe I never heard of this guy until a couple of years ago. He leads as if he's been doing it for years and Evans is assisted by a unique cast of characters, one stranger than the next, but their goal is all the same, to leave the crowded, filthy, back of the train, for the luxurious front. Every car brings with it new challenges and they must fight for their lives, before they can even worry about their freedom. The fact that this whole movie takes place on a train is intriguing and makes from some pretty unique scenes. Snowpiercer is one of the most imaginative films to come along in a long time and it features a huge cast of talented actors, that span multiple generations and ethnicities. To even my surprise I really enjoyed the film and couldn't wait to see what lay ahead in the next boxcar, but for as much as I liked the film, a thought kept gnawing in the back of my mind, why a train?"" ]"

Sabotage is the Governor's third starring role since returning from his stint in politics, and it's easily his best one to date. Schwarzenegger stars as Breacher, the commander of an elite DEA swat team, who agrees to help his under appreciated team take part in the theft of millions of dollars, from a top cartel boss. The heist goes relatively smoothly, but when the team goes to retrieve their money, they discover that one of them double crossed the rest and had stolen the pay day. Everyone is upset and trying to figure out who it was, when the cartel shows up looking for retribution. As the cartel picks off the team one by one, the remaining members have to ban together to try and stop them, except this time, they have to do it knowing that one of them is a trader. Arnold isn't doing the crazy stunts or fighting scenes that he's become synonymous for, he's in more of a leadership role in this film, but he's still the man when it comes to action films. Here he's paired with the Killing's Mireille Enos, who as the only female member of the team, gives an amazing performance. I'm used to her always playing these quiet, reserved, troubled characters, and it was a real treat to see her break out as the wild girl on a team full of men. Sabotage is the rarest of Action films, as it is one with a great storyline, that is as gripping as any drama. The film isn't just about killing people and blowing things up, it has plenty of that, but in the case of Sabotage, there is a reason for all of it, and this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat."" ]"

The film features a great cast, that made me desperately want to see it, but the problem is that it's a very common tale and it moves along at a snails pace. Even with a story that's been done over and over again, Blood Ties still could have been something special, because of it's cast, but that didn't happen simply because it is one of the most predictable films I've seen all year. The film features two brothers, Chris (Clive Owen) a career criminal, just released from prison, and Frank (Billy Crudup) a New York City Detective, who tries to help Chris get back on his feet. Didn't I see this movie in 2007 when it was called We Own The Night? That film has the exact same tagline, but fortunately wasn't as predictable. Billy Crudup stars as the good brother and was the only interesting character in the film, surprising considering the film features two of my favorite actors, James Caan and Charlie Tahan. Unfortunately neither of them have a particular big or interesting role, as everything centers around these two brothers. The con is played by Clive Owen, who honestly seemed like he didn't want anything to do with this role. He is emotionless, uneven, and every time he has any kind of long dialogue, I thought I was going to fall asleep. The bottom line, one's a cop, the others a con, I wonder what's going to happen? What happens is exactly what you think is going to happen, so why even bother to watch this extreme disappointment?"" ]"
wolf-creek-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""There is a common misconception that Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) was a real person. In fact the character was created from the stories of Australia's most heinous criminals. While the crimes themselves are real, they were committed by a variety of people, not just one man. What made both films work, was the character of Mick Taylor, who while being a horrific serial killer, was still very likeable. Taylor is charismatic and most important of all very funny, and audiences in 2005 ate it up. After the success of the first film, a sequel was immediately planned, but put on hold due to the fact that some of the crimes portrayed in the film, were still being prosecuted in court. The legal issues delayed the film eight years and kept it out of theaters, which is a shame because it was better than the first and received almost no exposure. In the second installment of Wolf Creek, Mick isn't just torturing victims at his dungeon, he's chasing a man through the outback, and when they finally meet, they come to discover that they aren't entirely dissimilar from one another. Ryan Corr (Saw 3D) plays the runner and is just as witty and entertaining as Taylor himself. The chemistry between the too was terrific and gave the series a whole new dynamic, which elevated it to another level. Wolf Creek 2 is so much more intense and at the same time comedic, compared to the first film. It was definitely a risky move by Writer/Director Greg McLean, that really pays off. The Wolf Creek films are no different and no less predictable than any other slasher film. What makes them unique is a character that encompasses the personalities of multiple serial killers and gives the audience the rarest of bad guys, the one that you root for. Even if you don't like slasher films, you may enjoy John Jarratt's extremely strong performance and get a few laughs in between the carnage."" ]"

For the next year, the duo ripped off the mob without consequence, until they took something that made them both the biggest targets in New York. This is another unbelievably true story, that has been brought to the big screen and the public eye, because of our on-going fascination with organized crime. Mafia movies do so well at the box office, that writers are scrambling to find any story they can turn into a film and it's the audience that has benefited the most. Some people say these movies glorify crime, and maybe they do, but to me, anything Mafia related is just fascinating. Watching these films and hearing these stories, you think how could that have happened? Then you go to Wikipedia and find out it's all true! Rob The Mob is the latest in a bunch of these little known Mafia stories to hit the big screen and it does not disappoint. Who plays a Mafia don better than Andy Garcia? Add to that the intense, Michael Pitt, straight off a successful run in Boardwalk Empire, and you have the makings of a terrific cast. The bottom line, Rob The Mob isn't Goodfellas, but it's a hell of a story, with a cast that's experienced in these types of films. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mafia movie, but if your like me, that doesn't matter much, it's the story and personalities that you're really interested in."" ]"

Due to the heinous nature of the crime and the complete incompetence of the local police, the story garnered national attention and has been featured on every news show you can think of. There have also been a ton of documentaries made, all of which I've seen, and all of which call into question who might have really committed these acts. 1993, West Memphis Arkansas, three 8 year old boys go missing in the woods. A huge search party spends 3 days looking for them, before finding them in a popular fishing hole known as the Devil's Knot. There is a big list of suspects, but all the police can see is a group of Satan worshiping teenagers, who have long been a thorn in their sides. Through some very questionable tactics, and a sham of a trial, these teenagers were convicted and sent to prison. From the beginning, there involvement in the crime was called into question, even by the victims families, who saw the injustice of the whole procedure first hand. With my knowledge of the story, I was really interested to see how a film would handle the overwhelming amount of information associated with this case. To my surprise, they didn't do the typical thing and just focus on one aspect of the story, they made the case for the guilt of each of the suspects, and they showed how the police blindly and incompetently when after these three teenagers. As the film goes, they hit the nail right on the head, but when you have all these suspects, and so much back story, squeezed into an hour and a half, it can become extremely confusing for audiences unfamiliar with the case. The film is further harmed by all the interviews and investigation which really slow the pace down. The story of the West Memphis 3 is a tragic one that has led to the freedom of a killer, who did horrible things to three little boys. Devil's Knot is a primary example of police misconduct and the lack of justice available to the less fortunate. If you have an interest, I highly recommend you look into the story and decide for yourself, and a non-bias film covering the events is a great place to start."" ]"

As the film progresses, the lines begin to blur, leaving the audience to question who is really the good guy and who is actually the bad guy? This film is notable, as it is the last thing Glee star Cory Monteith worked on before he died, and it was a definite change in direction for the young star. The story starts on Eugene Wellington McCanick's birthday, a happy day that should mark a reunion with his son, but instead marks a day where he learns that the biggest bust of his career, acquiesced killer Simon Wells (Cory Monteith) had been paroled. McCanick is ordered to leave the situation alone, but he can't rest while this man is on the street and McCanick goes looking for trouble. This is a very dark and methodical drama that really seems to have no depth whatsoever, until you see both sides of the story presented in flashbacks. David Morse stars as your typical tough loner cop, whose life is all about the job. The kind of cop that takes his job personally and will do whatever it takes to bust the people he sees as a threat to his city. When I think tough guy, David Morse is not the first person who comes to mind, but he has a history of playing both the good and the bad guy, making the role of Eugene McCanick perfect for him. He's paired with Cory Monteith, who as a teen heartthrob, has never really been seen as more than a sweet, loveable guy. Simon Wells is anything but sweet an loveable, as he's been severally damaged by a life on the streets, but the question becomes just how bad a guy is he? McCanick is the kind of film where everything seems to be laid right out in front of you, the kind of film where you're not expecting a surprise, but that's the whole premise of the film. The whole purpose of the film is to make you question everything you believe and it really turns into to something very unique and special. McCanick doesn't have a cast or a preview that screams out to you, many people are just going to skip it, but if you do, you'll  be missing that special kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it's over."" ]"

The story is called Joe, and you'll figure out why by the end, but to be honest, I saw this film more as a coming of age story, with the majority of the focus on Gary (Tye Sheridan). Gary's family is difficult to say the least, both his parents are drug addicts, and it's up to him to earn a living to support his sister. One day while out in the woods, he comes across Joe, a man who owns a lumber company and persuades him to give him a job. Gary is a hard worker who comes to see his boss as more of a father figure than his own father, and when things get bad, he's turns to Joe for help. Joe is no saint though, as he has his own criminal past and is reluctant to get involved. This is one of these really dark, slow moving dramas, where everything may or may not be important to the story. The real action is spaced out, but when something happens, the intensity is off the charts. This film is very similar to, Winter's Bone, which also had a young lead trying to save her siblings. While Tye Sheridan is not Jennifer Lawrence, his more quiet demeanor makes him more likable in the eyes of the viewer. Sheridan is a kid who came out of nowhere to star in the independent film, Mud, and since then has become known for making these super dark, intense films, where he plays a quiet, reserved character that one can't help but root for. Nicholas Cage is equally as good in a role that is more dramatic than most of things he's done lately. That being said, Cage still has it and together with Sheridan make for one of the most interesting and unique films I've seen all year. The story and even the trailer seem to be a little dull, most people will look at this film and see it as too slow and dramatic, and at first, I thought so too, but as the film progresses it just gets better and better, ascending to the level of a must see movie."" ]"

I've never been all that crazy about George Clooney, but I love Matt Damon, and the film is based on a little known tale from a famous historic event. Stories like this one, are often turned into some of the best films that Hollywood has to offer, and I was sure this film would be a can't miss. Clooney stars and directs this extremely large and diverse cast, which ultimately turns into it's downfall. When you have a large cast of talent, you need to be very careful about how you use them. In The Monuments Men, the cast is split up all across Europe, leading to short scenes, that jump from location to location far too quickly. When the crew is reunited towards the end, the film becomes much better, and in my opinion, this is how the story should have been told right from the beginning. The story centers around a community of art lovers, who are distraught about the Nazi's theft of historic works of art. As the war is winding down and the Nazis defeat is imminent, these men want to make sure that the worlds greatest works of art are protected, and their willing to risk their lives to do so. As I stated earlier, George Clooney stars and gives his usual performance. When Clooney first started doing movies, he was exciting and really gave audiences their moneys worth, but lately all he does is play the same character over and over again. Clooney is the mysterious, handsome stranger, who does a lot without saying much. Some people love that kind of thing, as for me, I find it to be lazy. If you just wanted to direct, there was more than enough talent to carry this film, and in fact, I would have preferred to see Bill Murray or John Goodman in larger roles. The story told in The Monuments Men is extremely interesting, but it's told in these fast paced, short scenes, that do nothing but confuse the audiences and squander the extreme amount of talent this film has to offer.

Odd is no different than any other twenty-something in town,  except for the fact that he sees the dead, specifically people who died prematurely and under suspicious circumstances. They can't talk to him, but the spirits lead Odd to the evidence he needs to find the truth. When a strange man comes to town, the spirits lead Odd to be suspicious, and with good cause. Anton Yelchin stars and once again shows off his loveable charisma. There is something about him that makes Yelchin the guy that everyone wants to be friends with, an ability that comes across in every character he plays. Odd is no different, as he is this complete weirdo, but with an innocent quality, that just makes people want to like him. Here he's more than just a lovable goofball, but he's also an unofficial detective and hero, that people turn to in there time of need. Everyone knows he's weird, but few know his secret, one of those being the Chief of Police, played by the legendary Willem Dafoe. Dafoe usually portrays the bad guy, and it was interesting to see him take on a different challenge. Odd Thomas is smart and extremely well written, with a terrific cast, that really brings the story alive with their own unique style. The story may seem like it's a little out there, but it's not just science fiction, it's a story that crosses many genres and has something for everyone, an easy choice for our list of must see movies!"" ]"
reasonable-doubt;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""District Attorney, Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper), goes out one night to celebrate a big victory, and fearing for the safety of his car, in a bad neighborhood, decides to drive home drunk. On the way, he hits a kills a man, running across the street. Another man, Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson) is charged with the crime and it's Brockden's job to prosecute the man accused of committing his crime. Not wanting to convict an innocent man, Brockden blows the case, but afterwards finds out that the wounds on the man he hit, were not consistent with being hit by a car, and match the wounds of seven unsolved homicide victims. Now Brockden must find out if he mistakenly let a serial killer go free. Reasonable Doubt, unlike many similar films, actually had a unique and original story. Both Dominic Cooper and Samuel L. Jackson were terrific, and the film really could have been the hidden gem of the year, but only got 3.5 stars. The reason is simple, while it was a great story, it was far too predictable to be what it could have been. I really it hate when the Writers assume that the audience is too dumb to figure out what's going on. That's what happens here, while the story is tremendous, everything is laid out in such a way, that even a child would know what would happen next. Aside from that, the great story and terrific cast make for an exciting film, that was quite enjoyable, but it was just predictable to a fault."" ]"
homefront;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When you combine Action with Drama, you had better have a damn good story to go along with the tremendous fight scenes and wild chases, or else you get a film that falls flat. We all know that at this point, Jason Statham is the best Action star you could have, but the jury was out on how effect he could be in a more dramatic role. In Home Front, Statham plays a retired undercover D.E.A. agent, who has recently become a single father. He and his daughter have moved from the big city to the small town, which his late wife called home, in the hopes of building a better life. Everything was going as planned until his daughter, stood up to a bully at school, and embarrassed the son of one the towns most influential families. The simple misunderstanding between children quickly escalates into an all out war, which will force Statham to use everything he learned in the D.E.A. to protect his daughter and his new home. Once again, Jason Statham was terrific in this film. It is mind boggling and seems to be impossible, but every film this man does is better than the one before it. He is on a winning streak, the likes of which I have never seen. Statham was terrific, but oddly, he's paired with an actor who doesn't have much experience playing the bad guy and it showed. James Franco plays Gator Bodine, a small time hood and drug trafficker, who goes after Statham with everything he's got, the only problem is, Bodine really isn't that bad a guy. In fact, when Franco starts cursing and playing all tough, it's almost laughable, not to mention the fact that he doesn't have a tenth of the fighting skills that Statham has. Being that this was a big budget film, Written by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky),  Directed by Gary Fleder (Kiss The Girls, Runaway Jury), and starting the best action star in the game (Jason Statham), it's very peculiar that they would choose a bad guy, who is best known as a comedic actor. While the story was great, Franco simply can not match up with Statham at all. Homefront has almost everything you could want in a Thriller, but the lack of a strong, believable opponent, really calls into question just how believable the film is and makes it somewhat predictable."" ]"
jamesy-boy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I have always been a huge fan of real life drama, because lets face it, some of this stuff you just can't make up. Even the best writers couldn't imagine some of the things these people have had to endure, and it makes for some amazing films. On the otherside of that, there are other stories, which just aren't that unique or interesting, and in my opinion really don't warrent a full length feature film, Jamesy Boy is an example of this. James (Spencer Lofranco) is your typical rebellious kid from a single parent home. He's not poor and has a lot of opportunities, but for whatever reason, he's turned to drugs and crime. He's living the gangsta life on the streets until the inevitable happens, and he winds up in jail. Once there, James witnesses a crime, and meets a man who helps him unlock a talent he never knew he had, but will James turn to the straight and narrow or will his friends pull him back into his old life? This is a true story and newcomer Spencer Lofranco was fantastic, but haven't we seen stories like this done over and over again? To be honest the only reason I kept watching it was to see which path James chose after prison. I wanted to see how his life turned out, but either way, we've seen films like this many times before and Jamesy Boy doesn't stand out in any type of significant way. If you want to do a film that has been done over and over again, true story or not, there has to be something about it that makes it stand out from the pack, and that doesn't happen here. The bottom line, Jamesy Boy is decent and it's fine if you're just looking to kill a couple of hours. It features a pretty good up and coming young talent and some old familiar faces, but beyond that, there's nothing really special about it."" ]"
kill-your-darlings;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Occasionally I come across a movie that I don't like, but not because it's a bad film. Somethings are not for everyone, but I can still appreciate the terrific performances and unique storyline of Kill Your Darlings. This film follows the early lives, and some previously untold stories, of the 1940's Beat Generation. People like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, & William S. Burroughs are featured prominently in this film, and show what some of America's greatest writers were like when they were mere college students. The story centers mainly around Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan),  who was better than any of them, and could have also been one of the greats, if it wasn't for an event that changed his life forever. The story is a gripping drama, telling a true, untold story from the 1940's, so what's not to like? There was a lot of focus on Philosophy, Art, Poetry and Love. There are some people that really that stuff up, but it just really wasn't for me. DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe were both terrific, but I'll always have a problem seeing Radcliffe playing anyone except for Harry Potter, and when Radcliffe was in a rather graphic sex scene, I admit I had to avert my eyes. The bottom line is that Kill Your Darlings isn't a bad film, but it's very philosophic and somewhat slow moving. I can see how some people are going to absolutely love it, but I just found it slow and a bit too artistic for my liking."" ]"

During a secret meeting, a mob boss gives his hit man a seemingly easy job. Pick up a bag, go to a motel in the middle of nowhere, and wait there until the boss comes to pick it up. The hit man does as he's told and gets a room at this motel, which is not only in the middle of nowhere, but is also filled with a group of ridiculously strange people, who all want this mysterious bag. John Cusack stars and no matter the role or the film, he's always fun to watch. There is just something about him that always makes his films entertaining and it's a good thing, especially in a film like this. While Cusack is along for the ride, it is very hard to follow along and like what you're seeing, because the film is just so bizarre. The cast of characters coming for this secret bag, include a pimp, a Russian midget, a corrupt sheriff, and a very weird guy in a wheelchair just to name a few. As the night wears on it becomes harder and harder to protect this bag, and in the end, when the bag is finally opened, you'll realize, that you just wasted 90 minutes for that!? I admire anything John Cusack does, De Niro is always terrific as a gangster, and if nothing else, The Bag Man is unique, but not for it's story. The hook, the thing that really drags you into this is that mysterious bag, which in the end, isn't as special as are you're lead to believe."" ]"
jackass-presents-bad-grandpa;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Moving in another direction for their fourth film, the producers of Jackass decided to focus on a single character from the franchise, Johnny Knoxville's Irving Zisman. The film has everything you've come to expect from the series, as Knoxville plays a Grandfather, on vacation with his Grandson. Knoxville does his usual schtick, crashing into to things, saying outrageous things to strangers, and of course showing off his giant rubber testicles. As with most of the Jackass stuff, it's outrageous and hilarious for the first half hour, but quickly gets old. Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate Jackass anymore, but when I start out watching one of their films, I love it, and by the end, I'm just waiting for it to be over with. Knoxville is impressive, and while he's done films on his own, I think he was giving a message to the rest of the group in this film. The message being, if you guys don't want to do this anymore, I can make it work with anyone, even a 10 year old kid. Hopefully the message gets through and we'll get some more Jackass films. I really do love the simplistic comedic genius of the films, but it's repetitive nature makes anything more than an episode of the show wear on me. Maybe it's just not made for someone in my age group anymore, but regardless of age, Jackass has always been good for a few laughs and Bad Grandpa is no exception."" ]"
enders-game;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The Ender franchise has turned into such a global phenomena that now, most kids are required to read it in High School. I was one of those kids and I absolutely loved the story. In fact I continued on with the books and they became unbearably strange. How they got almost 20 novels out of it is beyond me. While I was really excited to finally see Ender's Game on the big screen, I knew the chances of it continuing past one film would be slim at best. It all has to do with the ending, which is bizarre and really shouldn't have been continued. For those who don't know the story, in the future, Earth is at war with an alien species known as the Formics. The Humans have taken heavy losses and in desperation have started a recruitment program, that focuses on children. Knowing that kids think in a different way than adults do, they are hoping to find that one genius who has the key to defeating the Formics. That child turns out to be Ender Wiggin, a child who under Earth's new Government, shouldn't have even been born. Seeing the story I read so many years ago, come to life on the big screen, was magical for me. Finally I was able to understand the parts that were just too confusing to see in my head and get the complete picture. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who somewhat miraculously, at the age of 15, has had the starring role in every film he's been in. After watching Ender's game it's not hard to see why, he was to this film, what Ender was to the Human's in the story. The producers surrounded him and his young crew with a cast of Academy Award winners including Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis, which ultimately strengthen the movie and must of really inspired this kid to give the performance he gave. While the film simply broken even at the box office, (killing any chance of a franchise developing out of it) it was very well done and closely mirrored the book. They did a near perfect job of deciding what parts should stay and what should be eliminated, giving us a film that was just as good as the book, if not better."" ]"
2-guns;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""...and the surprise winner of the year goes to 2 Guns! The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns! I can't recommend it enough."" ]"
red-2;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""In 2010, DC Comics introduced the world to one of it's lesser known series, R.E.D. (Retired Extremely Dangerous). What I loved about that film was that it took old school action stars and put them into a modern action movie. The expectations for action movies are much higher today, no longer are they just chases, explosions, and gun fights. Today, people expect action films to have some kind of story, characters with personality, and even some humor. RED delivered all that and more and so does it sequel. Even though there are some bigger names in RED's second installment, the humor didn't play as big a role as it did previously and the story moved a lot faster. To some, this may have been a good thing, but for me, too much happened too quickly. I liked it better when we didn't know the characters or what to expect from them, when things were explained, and not just delved into. The first film made RED seem very original, but it's sequel really does play like a story that was adapted from a comic. Don't get me wrong though, while the second film doesn't compare to the first, it is still far better than some of the other action films released lately. You really can't go wrong in having an action film that stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, they seem to just be oblivious to the signs of aging and are as believable today as they were in their prime. Alone, this pair would have been terrific, but you add true legends of the screen like Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirran to the cast, and honestly, I don't see how any movie fan would want to miss that! The acting is terrific and the story, while proceeding much too quickly, was still a pretty interesting one. I did really enjoy RED 2, my only wish is that they had slowed things down a little and let us catch our breathe."" ]"
parkland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Based on Vincent Bugliosi's book, Four Days in November, the film Parkland chronicles the events following the assassination of JFK. What I liked about this film was how it tells a part of the story that isn't widely known. From the doctors at the hospital, working on the President, to the acquisition of the Zapruder film, Parkland goes behind the scenes to tell the untold story. I was also impressed with how the film managed to stick to the facts and not dwell on any of the conspiracy theories that surround the case. Zac Efron stars and really wasn't all that great. I think that Efron needs to stick to what he does best, taking his cloths off and making people laugh. While the film is kind of slow, I really enjoyed Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Abraham Zapruder, the man who filmed the assassination. Zapruder really struggled with releasing the tape to the media and the events he witnessed ultimately destroyed his life. Giamatti's portrayal of the man is supposedly spot on and truly deserves an honor mention. Parkland gives us a lot of new information about the events that followed the assassination of President Kennedy, but a lot of it are things the general public really aren't that interested in learning about. For a Kennedy aficionado, this film must of been eye opening, as for the rest of us, it was an interesting, non-bias view of history, albeit a little boring."" ]"
the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""For those of you who didn't read the book, City of Bones, this movie may seem a bit confusing to you. This film is kind of like a cliff notes version of the book. Certainly they had to cut things out of the nearly 500 page novel, but some key moments are simply touched upon with a line or two, making the movie a bit confusing at times. Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal girl, who for some reason can't stop drawing a symbol. When she starts asking about the symbol, she is pulled into a world she never knew existed. As it turns out, Clary is keeping secrets, secrets she doesn't even know she has. It's those secrets that will eventually put her life, and the lives of everyone she knows, in danger. At first, the two main characters seem like they are completely different and won't have any chemistry at all, but as time goes on, they learn they're more alike than they think. Once their on the same page, the story really takes off. Lily Collins (Abduction, The Blind Side) really takes hold of her character and gives the film a strong female lead, that rivals Katniss Everdeen. Collins is paired with British heart-throb, Jamie Campbell Bower, who is a lot more than eye candy. I'd never seen Bower in anything, except bit parts in Twilight and Harry Potter, but the guy has some serious fighting skills. Bower is another one who at first doesn't seem to fit, but in the end really helps to make this film something special. To answer the big question about City of Bones, no, it is not as good as the book and you really shouldn't have expected it to be. The novel is massive and has entire parts that simply couldn't be transferred to the big screen. Some things were left out that shouldn't have been, while some of the more fast paced scenes were extended for the screen. All in all, I thought this movie was a pretty good representation of an excellent novel and a great film to include in your next movie night."" ]"
the-frozen-ground;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I find that the best thrillers come from films that are based on real life events. Some of these stories are just so twisted and crazy, that even the best writer wouldn't be able to imagine them on their own. The story told in the film The Frozen Ground, is one such story, telling the world about serial killer, Robert Hansen. From the 1970s until 1983, Hansen was one of the nations most prolific serial killers. What makes Hansen's story unique is that he was able to do all this, without the police even connecting the cases, because of where he lived. Hansen's story begins in Anchorage Alaska, where he began preying on prostitutes. After torturing and killing them, he would dump the bodies in remote, unpopulated areas of Alaska, where they were ravaged by the weather and wild animals. This made finding the cause of death or even identifying the victims nearly impossible. Hansen would probably still be active today, if it wasn't for Cindy Paulson, the only victim in 12 years, to escape the madman, and that's where our film begins. Nicholas Cage stars as Jack Halcombe, a state police detective who comes up with a wild theory that all these missing people and strange deaths, could be connected. Halcombe has a tough time convincing anyone of this, especially since his only witness is a drug abusing prostitute. Nicolas Cage excels in movies like this and is again terrific. Cage was born to play a cop and in my opinion does it better than anyone else out there. In this film, he's paired with Zac Efron's ex, Vanessa Hudgens, who wasn't great, but was much better than I expected. It's difficult to make the transition from Disney cover girl to a legitimate movie star, but I'd say that Hudgens is well on her way. Finally, John Cusack rounds out this all-star cast, playing Robert Hansen. After all the films I've seen Cusack in, I really couldn't imagine him as the bad guy, but his performance is what really helps this movie stand out, and hopefully will lead him to other similar roles. The Frozen Ground is a little slow, but it is supposedly very accurate, and tells an interesting story that most people know nothing about. It's the kind of film that I really go for and hopefully you will too."" ]"

They are lazy, usually have no storyline, and the constant camera movement is just nauseating. Europa Report is different, as the film is told through surveillance cameras, aboard a state of the art space ship. Europa is a privately funded mission to the sixth moon of Saturn, to investigate strange heat signatures detected by NASA, that could be alien lifeforms. The cinematography was better than most of these film, and there was somewhat of a back story, however Europa Report is really not much different than a million other similar films. Nothing really happens until they reach their destination, they find something strange, and then must decide if fighting for their lives is worth the potential for scientific discovery. I bet you can name a dozen other films that were similar. As for the cast, they were just like film, in that they were very average, with little to nothing of note. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and I'm always hoping these films will show me something new and excited, but as with Apollo 18, Mission To Mars, Sunshine, and Moon, I was extremely disappointed. Europa Report wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't unique in any way. If you haven't seen many films, you may be wowed by something like this, but if you're like me, all you're going to find is a very boring and unimaginative film."" ]"

His cold, callous style and willingness to do anything, earned him the nickname, The Iceman. In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out."" ]"

As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere near as good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected."" ]"

For 12 hours, once a year, all crime is legal and people are given the opportunity to release their hatred and rage on anyone they can find. The cast isn't important to a film like this, it's all about the writers cynical message, that behind every smile is jealousy, behind every hand shake is anger, and trust has become a luxury that no one can afford. This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any rapes or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into. The Purge is definitely all about the authors agenda and it is somewhat predictable, but what made the film for me, was the terrific ending, which really does give the audience the chance to challenge the cynical nature of the film."" ]"

There is enough going on that you will keep watching it and you will be glad you did! Watching as many movies as I do, I tend to figure things out pretty quickly, and I was sure I had this film figured out early on. As I got to the end of the film, I was sure I knew what happened, and I was somewhat disappointed at the predictable story. Then, the writers throw a huge twist into the plot that you will never see coming and it really makes the whole film. Evidence quickly becomes one of those films that will keep you thinking about it long after the credits role, and too me, that is the best kind of movie. No one of name really stars in this film and there really aren't any stand out performances, it's just one of those movies that stands on a strong story. I usually hate these cheaply made, found footage films. The plots are lazy and they rely on cheap scares and effects to make people jump, but Evidence wasn't like that.

It just really drives me crazy to see how obtuse the writers of these films can be.

By the time anything actually happened here, I was already fed up and disinterested. Assault On Wall Street looked like it was going to be a can't miss action/thriller.

Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) is an eccentric millionaire, who wants to help people that are down on their luck, except there's a catch. With a large sum of money at stake, Lambrick invites several down on their luck people to his mansion, where they must play a game in order to win, a deviously twisted game. Would you rather stab yourself or a complete stranger? Would you rather take a razor blade to your eyeball or cut off your own finger? These are some of the challenges involved in this game, which sees the winner go home rich and the losers in worse shape then when they started. Jeffrey Combs of Star Trek fame stars and was absolutely the perfect choice to play the sadistic millionaire. In all his roles he has this crazy twisted side, behind the mask of a very likeable guy. In this film he is paired with the beautiful Brittany Snow, who is there to help her sick brother. As it turns out, she is the logical one, who tries to match wits with Lambrick, making for some terrific dialogue. Would You Rather is creepy and graphic, just when you think you have it all figured out, the story takes a twist, and you're back into the satanic paradise. This film is everything I look for in Horror and will definitely be included in my 2015 Halloween Horrorfest, and it should absolutely be considered for yours."" ]"
the-call;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When it was announced that WWE was staring a film company, like most, I thought it was a joke. After some success with films like the Marine and 12 Rounds, the company earned some legitimacy and with it comes bigger talent and better Directors. The Call is the first WWE film that doesn't star a wrestler, and it was every bit as good as any Hollywood thriller that was released last year. Halle Berry stars as a 911 operator, whose worse nightmare is realized, when a kidnapping victim calls in from the trunk of a serial killers car. From there, the Call becomes 90 minutes of pure, non-stop intensity. It's hard to imagine a film that features a girl in a trunk and a woman in a call center, being as entertaining as it was, but that's where the experienced Hollywood talent comes into play. Halle Berry is not someone I consider to be a terrific actress, but she surprised me, by playing a character who had to overcome emotion and think on her feet. It quickly becomes evident that going by the book will lead to this girls death, and the operator comes up with some pretty novel ideas about how to deal with the situation. The supporting cast, which does feature an active WWE superstar, is also very good in assisting with the statewide manhunt. This film was really on pace to be one of my favorite films of the year until the ending. It was very strange, but the film gets to a certain point and then just ends. There may not have been much more of the story to tell, but the way it ended made me feel like I left the theater a few minutes early to answer an important phone call or something. It maybe a small thing to some, but to me, it really took a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. The Call is not that original, outside of the particular situation, it's a type of film you've seen many times over. It is however intense, fast paced, very entertaining, and most definitely worth the price of admission."" ]"
the-host-2013;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, In Time) is known for taking ideas presented in short stories and turning them into something magical for the big screen. The Host is loosely based on Robert Silverberg's classic, Passengers, and tells the story of aliens who come to earth and use human beings as host bodies. Once inside, the aliens replace their humans consciousness for their own purposes, but some are able to resist this process and even control their alien host. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is one of those people, and while she can't rid herself of the alien presents inside of her, she can control it. Saoirse Ronan stars and it is great to finally see her in a movie that is worth while. Ronan is one of the top young actresses in Hollywood, but she keep playing roles like Hanna, in terrible films that do little more than to allow her to show off her talent. In those films, she was the only thing worth watching, so putting her in a film that's actually good, really gave her the opportunity to shine and she was amazing. Ronan played the role of Melanie, trapped in her own body but also played the alien Wanda that was inside of her. Once gaining control of Wanda, Melanie seeks out her family, which are part of the resistance. He main love interest is played by Max Irons, who was also terrific. Known more as a model and background character, this was really one of his first starring roles, and he was fantastic, playing a man caught between his love for this girl and his hatred for the alien inhabiting her. The Host has it all, an alien race, chasing a fugitive on the run, leading up to a major dilemma, wrapped inside a love story. Silverberg's Passenger is a favorite of mine and I knew with Andrew Niccol at the helm that this was going to be a good film, but I had no idea how innovative and intense the story would be, and for that, The Host is the latest film to join our list of must see movies."" ]"

With a big interview in the morning, the boys are planning on taking it easy, but things don't quite turn out that way. I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical."" ]"
jack-reacher;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Jack Reacher was nothing like I expected it to be. The previews made this film look like a comedy, featuring some bad ass cop that doesn't play by the rules. The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name. Cruise actually does a decent job and was very believable, as was the story, but the one major drawback for me was just how little was left to the imagination."" ]"

The former was such a popular direct-to-video rental, that it's sequel actually wound up on the big screen, and how it avoided an NC-17 rating is beyond me. I've seen a ton of Horror movies, it's one of my favorite genres, so I can say, without hesitation that The Collection is one of the creepiest, goriest, and most clever Horror films I have ever seen. This crazed man in a mask is looking to collect certain types of people and if they pass his test, they can join his collection. If they fail, they become experiments in human suffering. In the first film, we see career criminal, Arkin O'Brien, fighting for his life. In the sequel, we see Arkin escape and lead a band of mercenaries back to the Collectors hideout, in order to rescue a captured rich girl. Of course once they get there, they find a maze of terror that rivals any film you've ever seen. I thought some of the machines in the Saw films were clever, but until you see this film, you haven't seen anything yet! How people come up with these things is beyond rational thought. Of all the ways to torture people, to come up with machines and techniques that exceed everything we've seen before is just sick...sick and very cool. The cast is the same as in every Horror movies, a bunch of dumb, no named actors, following a couple of smart people in order to stay alive as long as they can. What's special here is the story, the affects, and the level of depravity. The Collection is one of the most violent and gruesome Horror films to come along in years. It's the first step in the evolution of Horror that fans have been waiting for for years."" ]"

They get new jobs and reconnect with family on their journey toward becoming a more mature couple, but it comes at a cost. Judd Apatow writes and directs this unique comedy, so I was expecting another hilarious winner, but they can't all be winners. The cast is fantastic and there are more than a few good laughs here, but this movie is extremely long and drawn out for a romantic comedy, and while it starts out strong, it starts to grow tiresome. There are many scenes between husband and wife that are boring and completely unnecessary. What I did like was how Apatow cast his daughters to be Pete and Debbie's daughters. They really are sisters and there was no pressure working for their dad, allowing them to really make it seem like this is a real family, and it's a good thing too, because for as good as both Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are, they just didn't have much chemistry together. Both cast members were good in portraying their own characters, but when you put them together you see that something just isn't right about the pairing. I loved the concept and you will definitely laugh during this film, but it does lack a certain chemistry and is far too long for what it is."" ]"
alex-cross;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""As a long time fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, I thought Morgan Freeman was the perfect choice to play Cross, and I loved Kiss The Girls. I was weary of a remake, especially one done by Tyler Perry, but to my surprise he was much better than expected, unfortunately, the film was not. Alex Cross has always been about beating criminals with his mind. The forensic psychologist is best known for his ability to out think rather than over power his opponents, but you'd never know it by watching this film. Alex Cross and his team are called in on a triple homicide, but the suspect had more on his mind then just his targets, and sets his sights on Cross and the team. There is a heavy focus right from the beginning on the bad guy, who we immediately see is Matthew Fox. To me this took all the mystery right out of the story, and instead of being a who done it, the film was about how to catch the bad guy. The writers didn't do that right either, as Alex Cross is blinded by rage and goes out guns blazing to fight and kill the assailant. While this may make for an exciting action film, it's not who or what Alex Cross is all about, and despite all the novels I've read, I felt like I didn't know the characters at all. Tyler Perry stars as Cross and shows that he's more than just a comedian dressed as an old woman. Perry was very intense and likeable, under different circumstances I would have really enjoyed his performance, but again, he wasn't playing the Alex Cross I know. He's paired with Lost's Matthew Fox, who has played the bad guy before. I love Fox as an actor, but he just doesn't have the look or temperament of a killer and wasn't very believable here. Alex Cross is one of my all time favorite characters, and the first time they put him on film, they did it right. The second time, wasn't one of Patterson's better stories, but still very well done. This time, Alex Cross has turned into John McLean, and while some people will love it, to me it just emphasized everything that is wrong with Hollywood today."" ]"
for-a-good-time-call;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""In recent years, the direction of female comedies has taken a turn for the better. It was always believed that a comedy, featuring a mostly female cast, would only work as a buddy comedy. No one ever thought that women would ever be able to successful pull off a raunchy comedy, until Bridesmaids came along and changed all that. For A Good Time, Call... is from the same writers and producers as Bridesmaids and may even be funnier. The story begins with Lauren (Lauren Anne Miller) being dumped by her long time fiancee. On her own, Lauren can't afford the upscale apartment she's been living in, and is forced to move in with Katie, a promiscuous, pill popping OCD, who she'd only met once before, at a party, where Katie threw up on her. At first, the hostility is off the charts, but when Lauren loses her dream job, she is forced to help Katie run her business, a phone sex line. This film is not for the faint of heart, as it is very raunchy, to the point of shocking even me, someone who thinks they've seen it all. While this may seem like a great thing, the truth is, as with most single themed comedies, the longer it goes, the less funny it gets. At first, seeing the things these girls were saying and the people they were talking to was hilarious, but after an hour of  this film, it just really wasn't all the funny anymore. Both the female leads are terrific and they are the reason this film works. For A Good Time, Call... is very raunchy and very funny, but it has one centralized theme and doesn't deviate from it much at all. If not for the amazing young ladies who star in it, this film would have got tiresome a lot more quickly then it did. For a good time watch this movie, it's way out there, but some parts are truly hysterical."" ]"
end-of-watch;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""By now, everyone knows that I hate these camcorder films, because they are lazy and don't really have much of a story to them, but there is an exception to that rule, and that is the TV show Cops. Police work comes with natural real life drama and action, in this instance the script really does write itself, so I was okay with it being used for a film like this. I just wish it had been done more naturally. I understand that the film takes place in a gang infested area of L.A. and that they needed to make it more dramatic and action packed for it to succeed in theaters, but you talk about going over the top. That's where Director, David Ayer comes in, after all gangs and going over the top are his specialty. End of Watch does have some great chase scenes and some really cool moments between partners, but for the most part it's just one non-stop explosion filled gun battle after another, making Los Angeles look like Fallujah. The point of view cameras do give us an interesting look at the action and some new perspective into how it's all made, which I thought was really cool, but I mean the lack of story line and constant shooting was beyond ridiculous. I'm some what surprised they'd didn't just go full on crazy and release the whole thing in 3-D."" ]"
stolen-2012;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Whenever I see Nicolas Cage's name on a movie poster, I know that no matter the film, I'm going to see a great performance. While Cage has done every conceivable genre, he is of course best know for his action films. In Stolen, Cage once again teams with his Director from Con Air, Simon West, to give us another exciting thriller. Cage plays Will Montgomery, a career criminal who has just spent eight years in prison. Montgomery comes out wanting to start a new life, but that's put on hold when he learns that a former enemy has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. I guess no one has ever told Nicolas Cage that you're supposed to slow down with age, because he is just as good in this movie as he is in all his other films. Cage, notorious for performing his own stunts, does some amazing things in this film and is of course pure intensity. In this film he's paired with Josh Lucas who was in a film by the same title in 2009, not to be confused with that movie, Lucas plays Montgomery's partner in crime and throughout this film you can see him and Cage feed off of one another, too me, that was the best part. Lets be honest here, rarely do action films have a decent story to distinguish themselves from one another. Stolen is no different, a daughter in peril, held by a weird foul mouthed bad guy, who is being chased by a want to be hero with a less than stellar reputation, you've seen this dozens of times.  What makes Stolen stand out from those other films is the cast, it's as simple as that. The cast really keeps you interested, even when the movie gets to be predictable and even when the stunts are impossible, the cast keep bringing you back to the edge of your seat, with their great performances and extreme intensity. For that reason, even though this is a familiar and predictable film, Stolen stood out from all the other action films I've seen lately."" ]"
house-at-the-end-of-the-street;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""House at The End of The Street is another ambitious, low budget, Horror film, that tries to make a name for itself by using star power, but how much was I really expecting from a PG-13 Horror film? The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions. If you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan, check it out, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time on this one."" ]"

Parts of this film reek with King's influence, but I don't think he'd be all that thrilled about it. When the film first started I thought it was a pretty good movie, but by the end I was just confused. The story follows a local resident in the town of Cold Rock, who has taken over her husband's medical practice after he passed away. That resident is played by Jessica Biel, whose performance and looks are really the only reason to watch this movie. In the town of Cold Rock, the children have been disappearing without a trace and the only thing people have seen is a tall man, dressed in black, leaving the scene. Some people say he's an urban legend, while others claim to have witnessed his abductions, and the whole town is terrified. I found it kind of funny that in a town crippled by fear, not knowing whose child could be next, the kids parents, let them ride their bikes to the store and let them play alone in the fields, it's just one of many parts of this film that just off. As I said, the beginning of this film is terrific, but then it gets weirder and weirder and builds to a conclusion that doesn't make any damn sense! I know this must of have been someone's passion and that they spent years developing it, but before you released it to the public, did you bother to watch it? Jessica Biel is sexy and a terrific actress who is way too good to be doing  b-movies like this. If you're a die-hard fan, check it out, she's great, but if you're not, I'd definitely stay away from this one."" ]"

Three things made this film standout and shine over the many, many superhero films that have been released. The most obvious thing is the huge, superstar, cast. Not only is it incredibly difficult to bring a cast like this together, but to get them to work together, without getting in each others way must have been nearly impossible. Second, even though the film involves superheroes and outer space, it seems somewhat realistic to us. These heroes have families, personalities, feelings, people get hurt, and some people even die, letting us see the human side of these characters. Finally, the Direction of Joss Whedon brings it all together. Whedon has always had this unique ability to put his own style on spin on things, at first it seems strange, but ultimately we come to love it. He is such an underrated Director, who brings so much to everything he's a part of, and it's great to see him get to do a huge project like this. The Avengers was special, not only because it took a decade to make, but because if you saw all the individual movies first, like I did, you feel a connection to these guys, it's almost like you know them personally and you expect them to act in certain ways when they all come together. The individual films really built up the excitement and helped the Avengers to become a billion dollar earner at the box office. From the performances to the special effects this was once exciting, terrific movie, and may be as close to perfect as a superhero movie will ever get."" ]"

The man really has the action junkies raving and each film is better than the last, but even he has a hard time making Safe worth watching. Former New York City Police Detective, Luke Wright (Statham), has lost his job, his family, and his respect. He's down on his luck and on his way out, when he finds a lost Asian girl in the subway. That girl is Mei, a numbers servant from China, who has been kidnapped and forced to work for an organized crime syndicate. As it turns out, Mei is holding a secret in her head that the Chinese, Russians, and even the New York City Police are willing to kill for, so when she runs away all hell breaks loose. The story here is actually pretty solid and Jason Statham is once again terrific, playing a deep character with a great back story. Had this film expanded on the story and flashed back to the past, it may have been a lot better, but as it was, Safe quickly turns into to one big chase, with lots of bullets and bodies. Newcomer Catherine Chan plays Mei and she was horrible. This girl has been kidnapped and seen horrors that most of us couldn't even imagine, yet she's always stone faced. She is emotionless and clearly using a fake accent, making her performance dry and full of mumbled lines that do nothing but confuse the audience. Jason Statham gives his usual high energy performance, with amazing moves, and terrific one-liners, but without any support, in a film that goes from one chase to another, it really is just a wasted effort."" ]"

The more things change, the more they stay the same, however, as this time, the story was a bit better, at least for an action movie, and the cast was a bit younger, but the basic genre was still the same. Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is once again brought together to do a job, this time there are some new younger faces, to complete what seems like what should be an easy job, what they weren't expecting was to stumble right into the middle of a madman's master-plan. As I said, the story wasn't as basic this time, things were a little more complex, but on a basic level this is still you're typical shoot em up action film, with bodies and explosions constantly coming at you. What I did like was how they change things up a bit and didn't just feature the same actors, even though many members of the team were the same. The one thing the first film was severely lacking was youth, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see Liam Hemsworth fighting with his shirt off than Sylvester Stallone. All in all, the sequel doesn't differ that much from the original, but where it does, only helps the series. The cast is younger, the story is better, and the action hits harder. If you're an action junkie, it doesn't get more exciting than the Expendables and the sequel will have you craving a trilogy."" ]"

Nicholas Cage is actual not the action star of this film, he is merely a High School English Teacher, with a seemingly perfect life. His world gets turned around though when his wife is savagely raped and beaten. As a result, Cage has two options, let the police do their thing or find someone else to take care of business. Can you guess which choice he made? Cage is of course fantastic as always. Even if the particular film doesn't suit your interests, when you see that it stars Nicholas Cage, you know you're about to be entertained. Guy Pierce is also excellent, giving a performance that was eerily similar to that of his character in Memento.

I have to see every movie he is in because he is truly hysterical and makes everything he is in exceptional. The sitter didn't have a very strong plot, but it was a hysterical movie that worked because of Hill. Everyone around him just follows his lead and plays off his energy and it was evident here. Hill along with three kids he's babysitting go on an unbelievable and hysterical adventure in NYC. It's one of those films you don't believe and that initial comes across as stupid, but it's also a film you can't stop watching because you want to see what happens next.

I don't know about the book, but this film was so well written, that it seemed like it was finished in no time! Damon was great, but in my opinion, it's his son and film narrator, Colin Ford, that steals the show. Ford starred in one of my favorite movies, Dog Days of Summer, when he was younger and I've followed his career ever since. He's mostly had bit parts, but every time I see this kid, his performance just gets better and better, and he absolutely blows everyone away in this film. I'm usually unimpressed by teens in film, in fact I want to smack most of them, but Ford is definitely the exception, and really adds an important dynamic to this film.

The story starts out very slowly and I wasn't expecting it to get any better, but it really does. I already mentioned how good Quaid is, but the star of this film is Tony Oller. I've heard him sing, but I've never seen him act, and to say I was impressed is an understatement. Between Quaid's outlandish behavior and Oller's teenage angst, I didn't need much of a story to follow in order to be entertained. Beneath The Darkness is strange and not everyone is going to like it, but it's one of these films that you keep watching, because you want to know what's going to happen.

At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the killer was revealed, my reaction was \""which one is that?\"" Besides being confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film. Like I said, the story is really good, the actors were really good also, but the film was just very long and confusing, and to be honest, I really wasn't all that impressed by it."" ]"
killer-elite;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Every Jason Statham movie is better than the last, as he continues to cement his reputation as the action star of Generation X. Since it's domination of the late 80s, Action movies have really suffered due to a lack of decent story lines and an infestation of stars, who landed these roles, simply due to their size, but Statham is changing all that, as evident by his latest film, Killer Elite. Based on the novel, The Feather Men by Ranulph Fiennes, Killer Elite covers the events, following a British covert op in the early 80s. The British Navy Seals (The S.A.S.) secretly forced out oil rich land owners in the Middle East, by whatever means necessary, in order to steal their land. Five years later, on his death bed, one sheik is seeking revenge for the death of 3 of his sons. To do this, the sheik has hired an elite team of underground hit men to take out the men suspected of killing his children, not an easy task when you consider that all the targets are highly trained former military operatives. Jason Statham stars as Danny Bryce, the team leader who is forced out of retirement, to take on the hardest job of his career. As has become common place, Statham is terrific and really carries the story on his back. Killer Elite is a someone complicated plot, with a first time director, but thanks to Statham's experience, you'll think these guys have been working together for year. As his reputation has continued to grow, bigger and bigger stars want to work with Statham, and any time you can add names like Robert De Niro and Clive Owen to a film, it only enhances it and boosts it's potential audience. Aside from just the amazing action sequences and covert maneuvers, the story adds real life drama to the film, by including shady government cover ups, double agents, and even police involvement in the events, making for the rarest of rare in the Action genre, a film with a deep and compelling plot. That's what really makes this film so good, it's not just about the chases, explosions, and killing, there is a real story here, that is unpredictable and very well written. Killer Elite may not top Parker as Statham's best movie, but it's pretty close. If you enjoy a fast-paced, edge of your seat movie, with a lot of interesting characters and a deep plot, than you won't want to miss this film."" ]"
straw-dogs;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""For the 30th anniversary of Dustin Hoffman's classic film, Straw Dogs, the studio decided instead of re-releasing a special edition, that they would do a modern re-make of the film. For those unfamiliar with the story, it features a local girl, from a small Mississippi town, who has returned home with her new husband, after making it big in Hollywood. Once back in town, the new couple needs some work on the old farm that she inherited and hire an old friend of hers to do the job. The team is the most qualified in town, but right from the start you can see the tension starting to build. Straw Dogs is far from being a unique story, but what I really enjoyed about it was how methodical it was. The jealousy and tension are obvious from the start, but they build it slowly, through a serious of events, which lends credibility to both sides of the argument. Things continue to build right up until the end of the film when all hell breaks loose, thanks to an incident that really shouldn't involve either the workers or the couple. James Marsden and Kate Bosworth star and are both very good, but the star that shines the brightest is Alexander Skarsgard. I've never seen him in anything before and had no expectations about the kind of job he'd do and I was blown away. He really had to play two different roles in this film and it leads to some shocking and unexpected moments. Comparing the 2011 re-make to the original film, the stories are very similar, whoever I found in parts where the original was a little slow, the re-make turns up the intensity, and that's the way things should be. A lot of re-makes don't even compare to the original and are seldom better, but in this case it was. The producers looked back at the old film and enhanced the parts of the original that were too slow or didn't make a whole lot of sense, before modernizing the whole thing. There are some people who will never admit to liking a re-make, but I think with Straw Dogs, the producers took a good film and turned it into a great one."" ]"

If you've seen Super Bad, The Hangover, Take Me Home Tonight, or any number of copycats, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Granted, the idea here is a little more original than most and the movie does do what it was intended to do, make you laugh. The faces are different, the situation is different, but everything else is exactly the same, there's nothing original here. Jason Sudeikis and Lake Bell do a great job of making us laugh, but again it's just your basic drunken idiots out to do something special, with all the pitfalls, and weird  that happens in-between. It was funny and a great way to kill a couple hours, but I got an extreme sensation of deja vu throughout this film. Overall, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is good for some cheap laughs, but it's honestly nothing you haven't seen before."" ]"
30-minutes-or-less;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""I hate this cast of actors more than I have ever hated the entire cast of a movie in my life. Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours."" ]"

fright-night;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I am not a fan of remakes, because rarely, if ever, do they do justice to the original film. That being said, I wasn't expecting anything out of the Fright Night remake, except for a cameo by Chris Sarandon. I was however pleasantly surprised, as the young cast was better than expected. For those who don't know the story, it is a classic vampire tale. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager, whose life revolves around High School and his beautiful girlfriend. Everything is perfect until an old friend tells him that his new neighbor is a vampire. At first Charley doesn't believe him, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that something isn't right. Anton Yelchin opposes Colin Farrell, and while he might not have the name recognition, he easily outshines the veteran actor. Yelchin has a cult following among fans of teen movies, after strong performance in films like Charlie Bartlett and Middle of Nowhere. As with most teen idols, his popularity is not just about his looks, it comes from his smooth relaxed style of acting, that people can relate to. Yelchin's characters are always real and honest, the kind of guy audiences can easily relate to, and that's what makes him as good as he is. Yelchin has help in this film from an all-star cast that includes, Farrell, Toni Collete, Christopher Mintz-Plasse-Mclovin, Dave Franco, and of course the original vampire, Chris Sarandon. The combination of chemistry between new and veteran make for a truly powerful cast, that bring new life to this classic story."" ]"
the-mechanic;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""In recent years, Director Simon West has become known for turning simple action movies into big hits, thanks his unique story lines. The story doesn't actually mean as much in action films as it does in other genres, because as long as people are getting killed and things are blowing up, most action fans are satisfied. Simon West wasn't and in recent years, he has given us some great stories to go along with the amazing action. His most recent film is actually a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson classic, by the same name. The Mechanic is a code name for CIA hit-man, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham). For years, the Mechanic has gotten the job done without question, until one day his next target is revealed as his mentor. The stories are similar, but the special effects and action moves are much more intense, and we have Jason Statham to thank for that. This man has single handedly taken action films to another level. For those unfamiliar, the man speaks several different languages, is trained in dozens of forms of fighting, and he's quick with a joke, many of which are unscripted. Every film Statham does is entertaining for his tremendous moves and unpredictability. The Mechanic gives Statham the chance to show off his talents and for that, I loved it, but trying to modernize the original story without changing it all that much, makes things feel a little outdated. I found many things to be tame by today's standards and the film itself does suffer because of it. Statham is paired with Ben Foster and that's problematic for the film as well. Foster is not known as an action star, he's the complete opposite of Statham, and in this case opposites do not attract, they had no chemistry whatsoever. In my opinion, Jonathan Rhys-Myers or Alex Pettyfer would have been a much better choice, but I am just a reviewer. That being said, the Mechanic isn't a bad movie, it has all the moves and wit of a typical Statham movie, but the story is more than a little outdated and aside from Statham and Sutherland, the casting left a lot to be desired."" ]"
faster-2010;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Revenge thrillers are my favorite type of action film. They are intense, fast pace, and have you rooting for the bad guy, who may not be so bad after all. My favorite revenge thriller is Payback with Mel Gibson, but Faster may be a close second. The Rock stars in a role that is absolutely perfect for him. The unnamed man was set-up for a crime his brother committed, a crime, that saw his partners turn on him and kill him. Now after nearly a decade in jail, The Rock is out and seeking revenge. With his size, intimidation, and weird eye brows, The Rock finds out who his brother was working with and goes on the hunt. Realizing this, the man who set everything up, hires a hit-man to stop him, and the chase is on. I do believe that wrestlers can be great action stars, but The Rock never really did anything for me until now. This cold, calculating man, out for revenge is by far better than any character he's ever played. If The Rock was alone in this film, it wouldn't have been as great as it was. He is paired with Billy Bob Thornton, playing a washed up, alcoholic cop, who is days away from retirement. He really doesn't need or want this case, but winds up stuck in the middle with some pretty funny moments. Thornton is one of those guys who is good in anything and always brings his unique and dry brand of humor to every role. The pairing of the two, in an intense, fast paced, story make this film an absolutely must see movie that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

The film is extremely eye-opening, showing just how bad a state most of our education systems are in. They clearly illustrate that no matter the area, teachers are failing America's youth at an alarming rate. I found the film to be very biased though, as it only points out what's wrong with the system, and fails to mention any of the positives that still exist in education. It also fails to offer solutions for the problems. Guggenheim throws lots of facts and figures at us and repeats the same themes. It gets to a point where he's just beating us over the head with the same concepts. Many people saw this as an inspirational call to action, but me, I saw it as a guy complaining. Honestly, if you can't offer up a solution than why present the problem? I'm pretty sure that almost everyone in America knows how bad education has gotten, even if they don't have the exact figures in front of them."" ]"

They'd planned to release this one in theaters but due to its NC-17 rating, they decided to go with the unrated direct-to-video method. This brutal and horrific story is about a writer who goes to a cabin in the woods to write her next book, when she becomes the victim of a horrible crime. She survives, but decided it's not justice she wants, it's revenge. I loved this film, because it's something that could actually happen, and when it's a realistic film, no matter how graphic, I find it to be that much more terrifying. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this one, because when I say it's graphic, it is ridiculously so! There is no way they ever would have been able to trim this down to an R rating for theaters, it's that brutal. Personally, I love films like this, the more graphic and realistic, the better, however many others don't agree and most critics claim the film made them physically ill.

These 9 have special powers that threaten these creatures, and they have set out to kill them, but for some unknown reason, must do it in order. Alex Pettyfer is Number Four and the next one in line. Pettyfer was absolutely incredible, having come such a long way since his last major role as Alex Rider. Newcomer Callan McAuliffe is also very likeable as sidekick Sam. I've never seen him in anything before, but he gives the story an added bonus and much needed side story. Many critics bashed this film, saying it was an alien version of Twilight, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Am Number Four isn't focused on the love aspect, a lot of action occurs and the story actually progresses, and this film isn't dark and narrow minded, the way the Twilight films have been. I Am Number Four kept my attention and interest throughout. I connected to the story and the characters as well as the actors, and I have no problem saying it is one of the best Science Fiction films I have a seen in years! ...and for those who feel the same way, the book sequel, The Power of Six will be released on August 23, and with any luck will hit the big screen next summer."" ]"

Gilchrist and the flashes of his thoughts, that we get to see, are the best part of this film and the only thing really worth seeing. Zach Galifianakis, who is one of my favorites, isn't at all funny, he's actually kind of pathetic in this film. Despite Gilchrist performance, the movie is actually quite stupid, I mean what kind of mental hospital lets the patients have access to the roof of the hospital? It looked good, has some really good actors in it, but nothing happens, the story is predictable as hell, and it's a \""comedy\"" in which no one really says or does anything funny.

With a sequel, we want to see the same characters we love, in a similar, but different story. This movie parallels the original to the point where they are uttering the same lines in the same situation, just in another city. If you saw the first one, while watching this one, you're going to know where they go and what happens next.

In this 2011 re-imaging of the series, Rogan play Britt Reid, the son of a billionaire publisher, who (surprise surprise) is a big time party animal, with no real ambition in life. When his father passes away suddenly, Reid is given this huge empire to run and with no idea how to do it, he starts to lean on the people around him, people like Kato (Jay Chou). Reid knew Kato for years, but knew nothing of what he could create and nothing of the skills he was capable of. With Kato's help, Reid decided to take on crime in the city, only one problem, he sucks at it. This film may be the most evenly scored film I've ever reviewed, because I can honestly say my like and dislikes were exactly fifty-fifty, most notably were the cast. Seth Rogan in the right setting is brilliant and in the wrong setting is just annoying as hell, with that hardly laugh and his never taking anything seriously, it is perhaps never more abundantly apparent as it is here. Cameron Diaz also adds nothing to the cast, but name recognition and a lazy one sided performance. On the other hand, Jay Chou was fantastic as Kato, he was clever, funny, exciting, and in my opinion he made this movie, it simply isn't a superhero film with him. Then there is Christoph Waltz, the man with the mesmerizing voice who forever capture our attention in Inglorious Bastards, and has been the quintessential bad guy in everything since. The bottom line is the new Green Hornet isn't without it's problems, but the story here is better than I expected it to be, there are some stand outs among the cast, and the special effects and fight scenes were hit or miss. This is the kind of film you'll be into or you won't. Just like my list, audiences are going to be fifty-fifty on the one as well."" ]"

Even if you can choose just one performance, it's usual from way back when they were in their prime, but at seventy-six years old, Michael Caine proves that some things are just better with age. Caine is portraying Harry Brown, an lonely old man, who has recently lost his wife. All Brown has left is his best friend and a tiny apartment, but that changes when a group of thugs start reeking havoc on the neighborhood and slaughter his best friend. After that, something in Brown just snaps, and he turns to skills he learned in the army a lifetime ago. This isn't a film about some over the hill action star in the CIA, there is no weird twist, or strange background associated with Harry Brown. He is just a real person, dealing with a situation that people have to face every day in lower income neighborhoods. The gangs have taken over and no one is safe, especially the elderly, and that is very apparent in this film. Harry Brown is an action thriller, but it is also one of the realist movies I have ever seen. Every thing from the gangs activity to the way Harry goes about is life is as real as it gets, and it is truly frighting. Michael Caine stars and he doesn't have the moves, temperament, or even style of your typical action hero, yet somehow he's better than all of them combined. For Caine it's never been about brawn, it's about brains, and that's what he uses against a gang that's a third of his age. Critics raved about this film, while I avoided it, because I honestly couldn't see Michael Caine cleaning up his neighborhood and taking out thugs at his age. I was wrong, because Harry Brown is one of the best performances of his career. This film is just so realistic and clever, I never would have expected it to be the amazing experience that it was. This film really got to me and it includes one of the best performances I've ever seen. Harry Brown is a true gem of independent cinema, it is free of any Hollywood bull **** and it is the reason people still go to the movies. Please take my advice and don't miss this one."" ]"

The previews were a riot and I love Martin Lawrence, so I decide to give it a try and was once again was taught that you can't judge a book by it's cover. This film turned out to be one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. It's a solemn day for Aaron and Brian, as they prepare to lay their father to rest. They expect it to be a small, simple ceremony, but they are soon reminded of why their family only gets together at weddings and funerals. A series of unbelievable and hysterical events keep disrupting the service, which include, but are not limited to, a gay midget, a guest tripping on acid, and a crotchety old man that really has to poop. I'm not surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, but I was surprised by the reasons why I liked it. You'd think an R rated film staring Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence would be raunchy as hell and way over the top, and it was, but not because of either of them. Rock and Lawrence were actually fairly toned down in this film and it was the large cast of supporting characters who really make the film. Danny Glover is amazing as Uncle Russell, an old timer who hates everyone and isn't afraid to run his mouth. James Marsden is equally as good, as the hated white boy friend, who takes what he thinks is Valium to calm down before the service.

The body has been there for at least fifty years, but the case awakens something in the detective who has to learn the truth. From there, quite ingeniously, the film is divided into three different stories, the story of the boy in the box, the detectives investigation, and the story of his own child. It was seriously like watching three different movies at once, and they were all great! The cast was pretty phenomenal too, as this was a very hard thing to pull off, but they did it seemingly with ease. Josh Lucas just blew my mind, giving an unrivaled performance as the father of the other missing boy. I've seen him in things before, but nothing was as memorable as this.

What I didn't like about the film, was a lazy story that hasn't only been done before, but seemed to just run around in circles. The Foster family is going through your typical dry spell as a married couple with kids, and the news of a recent friends divorce has them worried about their own relationship, so they decide to start having a regular date night again.

The Foster's think they're just stealing a reservation, instead they are stepping into the lives of two people who are wanted by many different people for many different things, leading to the wildest night of their lives. This story had some great potential, but once again, if these writers would stop worrying about PG-13 vs. R, in regards to who will go see their films, and just let the story take off in whatever direction it's going, the film could have been so much better. Instead, the writers hold back, because they don't want a raunchy comedy, they want a date movie, and the result is a mediocre comedy that should have been so much better than it was. Date Night is good for a chuckle here and there, but otherwise, the story goes in circles, it's predictable, and it wastes the talent of a terrific cast."" ]"

edge-of-darkness;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Edge of Darkness is a dark and gritty crime thriller, based on a 1986 British Mini-series of the same name. The story was actually pretty good, filled with twists, turns, crosses, and double crosses, but the problem was that it was all too familiar. Murdered daughter, angry father looking for justice, Mel Gibson on a crazy rampage....and why are these things always in Boston? Does Hollywood have some secret underground bet about who will have the worst accent? That being said, Gibson, (minus the accent), was terrific. Say what you will about him as a person, but when it comes to a dark, action thriller, there is still no one better than Mel Gibson. His character was very reminiscent of Porter in Payback, intense, strong, and smart as a whip. As I said before, this is a good story, made even better by Gibson, but it's a familiar story that's been done to death! Edge of Darkness is very entertaining and has some nice twists, but ultimately it's not much different from a dozen other films with a similar tagline."" ]"

It's adequate and somewhat entertaining, but nowhere near as good as it should have been. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars a a junior C.I.A. agent, working out of the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Until now he's been asked to do simple things. His role quickly changes once and international terror cell sets up shop in his backyard. Rhys-Meyers is quickly paired with a veteran C.I.A. hit-man. The kind of guy you call when you want things done quickly and under the radar, but years of killing has taken it's toll. The mysterious man has become cold and reckless to a fault. The story here is painfully predictable, in a film that is about half as long as it should have been. Yes, the film is basically non-stop action, but it moves in such a way that the story is rushed to the point of confusion. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was terrific in an opposites attract kind of way. John Travolta on the other hand was much too old and out of shape to be believable as this crazy, over the top hit-man. The chemistry between the two and the amazing non-stop action make this movie a pretty entertaining one, but the predictability and rushed story take too much away to make it the kind of film that keeps audiences buzzing after it's over."" ]"
daybreakers;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I hate vampire movies! From Dracula to Twilight I find the whole genre absurd and have never enjoyed a film that has featured vampires, until now. I chose Daybreakers, because it is a new idea in an otherwise stale genre. It's about a modern day utopian society where the bad guys have actually won! Modern society has adapted, from industry and technology to entertainment, to accommodate a society run by vampires. Humans are nearly extinct and the vampires are looking for a blood substitute to sustain their population. On the other side, the small groups of remaining humans think they may have a cure, but need some willing vampires to help them. Even though this film features vampires, it's more of a science fiction film. about two groups trying to deal with the problems of a futuristic society, and it was really well done. Ethan Hawke stars as a vampire, who refuses to drink human blood. He feels empathy for the humans and doesn't like what his race has become. Hawke was one of these young actors who had nothing but looks. When he first started he was really nothing more than eye candy for bad movies. Since then, he's really worked at becoming a better actor and today, he thrives in Sci-Fi movies like this. He's paired with some veterans of the genre, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, both of whom add that aged wisdom needed to support this young cast. This film is a terrific example of how innovative and entertaining science fiction can be, but it's so much more. There are action scenes, romance, and even some gore thrown into the mix, and the result is one of the best Sci-Fi film I've seen all year. The violence and blood may turn some people off to the film, but for me, this really became a can't miss gem."" ]"
whiteout;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""When I first saw the previews for Whiteout, I didn't think it would be anything special. It wasn't until Netflix recommended it for me and I read the description, that I thought there might be something there. While the previews made it look like some arctic nightmare, the truth is that it was a pretty great film. The story is centered around a U.S. Marshall, stationed at the base in Antarctica. For more than 3 years, she didn't really have much to do, but that all changed when two base members are found murdered. It then becomes Carrie Stetko's job to solve the first murders in the continents history. Despite a lack of other people and places to go, the writers of this film did an excellent job at keeping this movie intriguing. I didn't think in a million years that a film like this would work, but actually it works out really well, and unlike a similar story, Fargo, the producers of Whiteout hold nothing back. Kate Beckinsale stars and really does a fantastic job. I've always like her abilities, not to mention the way she looks, but this film is the first time her performance really stood out to me as something special, maybe she should consider playing a cop more often. As someone who's seen thousands of films, it always amazes me how the films I expect the least from, always deliver the biggest surprises.

Hader is one of the funniest and most underrated comedians in Hollywood and I can honestly say that he is the only reason to watch this movie, because the rest of the cast is just dull and uninspired. Eisenberg gives another flat and emotionless performance, while co-star Kristen Stewart plays along as if she were still one of the undead.

Observe and Report is one of those films that just doesn't cut it. In the film, Seth Rogan plays Ronnie Barnhardt, who is the equivalent of Paul Blart on a bad trip. He's a mall cop, who is obsessed with his job and with the hot girl who works the make-up counter at the local department store. Literally the only funny part of this movie is the flasher, that Ronnie is trying to catch. It's simplistic humor, but a man running around a mall, flashing his penis at people, and making dirty comments is funny! The rest of this film is not, as it's one big racist, childish, romp, through a world of sex, drugs, and the abuse of power. Rogan is terrific, but his character was a rambling, confused, uneducated guy, that just wears on every last nerve. Observe and Report is a film that has been done, many times and in many different ways. The producers hoped that an all-star cast would help the film, but sadly it doesn't. The film plays as though it was written by a teenager, and all that's missing is the fart jokes. I'm a big Seth Rogan fan, but I was sadly disappointed by this film."" ]"

I found myself quite confused at many different points in the film, especially at the end, when I had to rewind 3 or 4 times. Jason Statham is far and away the top action star out there today. What's so great about him falling under the radar is that he gets to do what he wants to do, instead of getting stuck with nothing but big budget disasters with no plot. The story behind The Bank Job and what led up to it, who was really involved in, was really interesting and made for a great plot.

the-air-i-breathe;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I really didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, after all several critics had refereed to is as a tame re-packaging of Pulp Fiction. The film is broken up into four parts that are out of order, and the characters all do eventually interact, there is also a mafia angle to the film, but overall besides the way things were laid out, I didn't really draw much of a comparison to Pulp Fiction. The stories all involve these peoples interactions with the mob, but they're all for different reasons and all have different outcomes. Andy Garcia is the boss, of course, always the perfect choice for a gangster or ruthless leader, and you get from him what's expected. What isn't expected is the tremendous performance of Brendan Fraser. I am not a fan and have never really considered him anything but a mediocre comedic actor, but after seeing The Air I Breathe, my opinion of him was definitely swayed. While watching the pieces, I knew they would somehow come together, but the way it was done was completely unpredictable and really something to watch. The film had a huge cast, with a ton of cameos, and just as many twists and turns. What I was expecting was far different from what I saw and I was more than happy with the way the film was done.

The debate team was just an instrument, and was comprised of four people who would all go on to play significant roles in the Civil Rights Movement.

Walk Hard is a mocumentary about an Elvis Presley type persona, whose music spanned an evolved over a 50 year career. As styles changed, so did Dewey Cox, his outfits, personality, and his music, it was all very clever. I especially liked when he ran into the Beatles at a monastery in India. Walk Hard has some very funny moments, but this film would be nothing without John C. Reilly. It seems like he's in everything these days and most of the roles are quite forgettable, but Dewey Cox is easily his crowning achievement. Reilly is an actor I don't care for, in a style of film I don't care for, yet I was still very amused by the whole thing. The one negative I can give the film, is that is was exceptionally long for this type of film and it spent far too much time on the early stages of his life. The end of the film felt rushed to avoid it becoming a three hour movie, which to me suggests that maybe it should have been split in two. The inherit problem with comedies is that the longer they are, the more tiresome they become. While I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot, by the end I really couldn't wait for it to end. Farcical comedies are usually way out there and Walk Hard has some of that, but by and large it was an interesting take on fifty years of American pop culture.

While I understand why, the fact is that many of them just don't realize that this film wasn't made for them. Criticism range from the film not being edgy enough, to the fact that the film didn't take place in Springfield and didn't utilize the side characters much, but again, the film wasn't meant for the die hard Simpsons fan. While the show has been on for more than a quarter century, prior to the films release, ratings for the show were in the toilet, and it was only being kept alive by syndication and merchandising money. The point of the film was to be childish and geared towards a younger audience. While fans of the show were expecting the film to be extreme like the South Park movie, what they got amounted to little more than a children's movie. The fans were upset, but the studios gamble paid off, as the ratings went up and have continued to be much better. For those who didn't see it, the film focuses on Homer, who made the mistake of polluting the town, to a point where the EPA put a big dome over Springfield to separate it from the rest of the country. As angry town folks form a mob, intent on getting Homer, the family escapes and goes on the run. The film is far from being the best the Simpsons has to offer, but it served it's purpose in attracting younger viewers and raising the ratings. Fans may have been upset with Matt Groening, but what he did saved the show for who knows how many future seasons.

28-weeks-later;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""In 2002, Director, Danny Boyle re-invented the zombie movie with his groundbreaking film 28 Days Later. Many credit Boyle with the current zombie craze we enjoy eleven years later. What made that film so enjoyable was that at the time it was a story we hadn't seen in a long time and it was shot in a way that made it look like a much older film than it was. Five years later the studio wanted a sequel and Boyle wanted no part of it, knowing that it would never live up to the original and indeed it does not. 28 Weeks Later is a continuation of the story, which claims that all the infected had starved to death and that England is free of infection once again. People start moving back in to areas of the country that have been fixed up for them and which are protected by the U.S. Government. We are then introduced to a family which has been reunited. The film starts out with a tremendous action scene that was the only part of the film I enjoyed and the only part that is reminiscent of the first film. The terrific opening is followed by a long, sappy, family reunion and then by a sick person being found. From that point, literally within ten minutes hundreds of people are infected and the army is shooting everything in sight. How could zombies have starved in the first place, but more importantly how can so many people change, just like that, within ten minutes? It didn't make any sense at all, to make things worse, all dialogue and storyline ends at that point and the movie turns into one big gory chase scene without any substance whatsoever. As for the cast of this film, they did nothing to help the story. In the first film, Cillian Murphy was amazing and carried us through the low points, but here it's a cast of newcomers and unsuccessful character actors, who quickly bring the story to a halt. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but not only doesn't it compare to the first film, but it doesn't even live up to the broad genre it is exposing us to. The cast was sloppy, the direction was confusing, and worst of all it just doesn't make any  sense! 28 Days Later was groundbreaking, but it's sequel is nothing more than an over-hyped movie that never should have been made."" ]"

The Davenport kids are flying to seeing their father for the holidays when they are stuck in Cleveland by a massive snow storm. When they get there, they discover they are just two of dozens of kids who are stuck at the same airport, trapped in a conference room under the watchful eye of the airports ruthless administrator, (Lewis Black) who's not all that fond of children. Together with some of the more unique personalities, the Davenports stage an escape and wreck havoc on the airport, determined to have fun during the holidays, even if it is in a snowed in airport. Yes, this is a kids movie with all the cheesy jokes and kid stuff that comes along with it, but what makes it unique is all the different personalities. The six kids are from all different parts of the country and are all from different family structures and different socioeconomic backgrounds, meaning they all had very different lives and very different ideas on what the definition of fun is. The culmination of the different personalities and how they all come together is what makes this film unique and quite frankly pretty special. The young cast is pretty talented as well, featuring Brett Kelly from Bad Santa as well as Tyler Williams from Everybody Hates Chris. The young cast also gets help from veteran comedians Lewis Black, Wilmer Valderrama, and Rob Corddry. The combination of young comedians and veteran comedians adds another dynamic similar to the one set up by the characters in the film. As well as the mixing of characters personalities, you're also getting a wide variety of comedic styles in the film. The bottom line, Unaccompanied Minors may be a kids Christmas movie, but there is a whole lot to like about it, from the writing, to the in depth character development, the mixing of different comedic styles, and even the unique settings. It's not quite Home Alone, but as close as anyone's come since 1990."" ]"

He's a deeply religious man, whose wife just left him for his brother. Lazarus responded to this by locking himself away and putting all he has into his farm. One morning he finds a badly beaten girl, with a reputation, laying in the road and decides to help her, but he soon comes to believe that this girl is possessed and that God sent her too him for help. Not knowing what to do, Lazarus takes this sex crazed, drug addict and chains her to the wall of his house. Throughout this film, there are all kinds of symbols that don't make any sense. There are scenes featuring an old blues singer talking nonsense, scenes of the town that we almost never see, and perhaps strangest of all, there are moles added to Jackson's face, something you don't see except it cases of a biography. As for the performances, they were terrific, This is the best performance I've ever seen Christina Ricci give and she really gave Jackson a run for his money. Jackson, was also great, giving what you expect to see from him, albeit with less swearing than usual. The performances were really the only thing this film did have going for it as the events that take place just don't make any sense. The film jumps around, leaving things unfinished, and personalities seem to change as often as the wind blows. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I really hate when great performances are wasted on a film that is so poorly written, that it's almost unwatchable. Black Snake Moan is sloppy, jumps around without finishing things, and at times just doesn't make sense.

It requires some background and does take quite a while to get going. Unlike any of their other films, previously or since, the duo decided to pack all the fun into the last half hour of the film. Hot Fuzz certainly has it's moments, but it's the last half hour that makes it a classic. Simon Pegg plays the serious one for a change, leaving much of the laughs up to Nick Frost who certainly doesn't disappoint. Personally, I prefer Pegg over Frost and would have liked to see his character loosen up a little bit, but it doesn't really take anything away from the story. The first half hour of this film, you're going to think I'm crazy, but by the last half hour, you'll be thanking me for recommending you see this film. It is a must for fans of buddy comedies and it just might force you to watch Shaun of The Dead again."" ]"
casino-royale;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I've never been a fan of James Bond. Probably, because I grew up with Pierce Brosnan as 007 and he sucked. I decide to give the series another shot, not because of Bond, but rather Daniel Craig. I have been a fan of Craig's for some time, having seen several of the films from overseas. I knew then that he would be a huge action star and now he's 007. As for my first Bond movie, it was pretty good. Craig was fantastic and avoided much of the cliché Bond moments that most of us have come to loath. The film was entertaining, but also pretty predictable and much longer than it needed to be. I was also very unimpressed by the bad guys. I thought Bond villains were supposed to be classic, but these guys were rather forgettable. I'm not in love with the Bond character, but this film did open my eyes a little bit and I probably will check out Quantum of Solace in the near future."" ]"

They fully understand, that even thou it isn't a comedy, they are in a completely ridiculous film, not meant to be taken seriously by anyone. Samuel L. Jackson is fearless, hysterical, and terrific as FBI Agent Neville Flynn. The supporting cast, of mostly newcomers, is also great, playing off the example set by Jackson and Margulies. Lets also not forget that while many of the attack scenarios were computerized, there were still a few dozen de-fanged venomous snakes with them at all times! I don't know how you can possibly concentrate with cobras and rattlesnakes at your feet, even if they are non-venomous and used to humans.

The ending was the most confusing part, not real sure what happened there, maybe one day I'll get it. This film had the star power, one of Hollywood's best directors, and a unique story, but it's going to be hard for a lot of people to follow.

While some writers choose to glorify these monsters, others simply want to show the truth behind their crimes and the investigation that followed. Unfortunately, in a lot of cases, the real story is no where near as interesting as Hollywood makes it out to be, that's where the based on a true story comes in. The case of the infamous Zodiac Killer was a fascinating case, of a man who not only killed at random, but who also taunted the police, by publishing cryptic ciphers in the newspaper, claiming if they cracked the ciphers, they'd know who he was. The man behind the crimes was certainly an interesting case, but the long investigation into finding out who the person might have been, was not. As a film, The Zodiac is said to be a fairly accurate portrayal of the crimes, the investigation, the paranoia than gripped the city, and the political pressure everyone faced as a result. The film makers didn't want to take liberties with the story, glorify the crimes, or present unproven theories from any one of the a number of books written about the Zodiac Killer. That being said, what happened was interesting, but also fairly slow moving and more than somewhat dry. For those people who are unfamiliar with the story of the Zodiac, they may enjoy learning about this case, but for those of us who know it, watching this film was like seeing a very long episode of the First 48. It's interest, the acting is suitable, and it passes the time, but if you're looking for a real entertaining, Hollywood version of the Zodiac story, you'll be much happier with the film simply titled, Zodiac, from 2007, starring Robert Downey Jr. That film is based on one of the more populist theories of the crime, and features more edge of your seat action than it's predecessor."" ]"
twelve-and-holding;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""With his utterly shocking debut film, L.I.E., Director Michael Cuesta, quickly proved that he wasn't afraid to push the envelope in order to shock his audience. That is why I was hesitant to see his other coming-of-age film, 12 & Holding. Thankfully, this film was more on the level and told a different kind of story, one that larger audiences can relate to. Rudy Carges (Conor Donovan) is an introverted 12 year old boy, who because of a facial deformity, does not socialize outside of his small circle of friends. A circle which includes a strong leader and protector, his twin brother, Jacob. One summer night, a bullies prank goes horribly wrong and Jacob is killed, leaving the group to find their own direction. As someone who recently lost someone close to me, this film really hit home, it was inspirational and a truly a wake up call. The film does an excellent job of showing everyone's grief from the family, right down to the furthest acquaintance, the type of lose and emptiness that people of all ages feel when a tragedy like this occurs, but then the film takes a turn. The three remaining members of the group realize, at their young age, that life is short and you never know what's going to happen, so they use the tragedy as the inspiration to turn their lives in another direction. Conor Donovan stars and it is miraculous that at his age he could play two completely different characters with such ease. The twins are so different, even though they are played by the same person. This is the kind of performance, actors three times his age can't pull off successfully, but Donovan does and it makes the whole film. Because of this role, the young Donovan actually got a role in the Departed, but hasn't been in much since then, which is truly a shame. 12 & Holding, actually uses actors that are the same age as their characters, and what these kids had to play through, and how they did so was truly phenomenal. IFC films have a reputation for being great, hard hitting stories, but this one really struck a nerve and the performances blew me away. If that's not the definition of a must see movie, than I don't know what is."" ]"

Unlike Williams previous hits, it's not raunchy and it won't tick off any particular group in America, but it's still a cute comedy, and Williams is as funny as ever. Williams proves in this film, that a good comedian is always funny, and that you don't necessarily need to be raunchy or obscene to be funny.

Instead of voting for the common good of the people, they are paid in voters and campaign contributions, to vote the way big business wishes them to vote. The result is laws that benefit the few and hurt the many. Thank You For Smoking takes an in depth look at one of these lobbyists, who works for big tobacco. In a satirical way, the film shows how this man is able to achieve his companies goals through bending the facts, bribery, and out right lying in a way that is completely legal under our system of government. Aaron Eckhart is terrific, which will come as little surprise to many, however the film was anything but. Like most films, Thank You For Smoking has it's moments, but overall the film is one short scene that just repeats it's self over and over again. The situations are different and the players are different, but the arguments and agendas are always the same. After watching two hours of the same thing over and over again, I was more than done with this film. No matter how charismatic the actor may be, the fact is that what lobbyists do isn't terribly interesting. It's one meeting and argument after another and the film just completely runs around in circles. The film was critically acclaimed for Eckhart's performance, but nothing else. Some critics think that one outstanding performance makes a film worth seeing, but I don't. Aaron Eckhart is an outstanding actor, who has been great in many other films that are worth seeing. Thank You For Smoking is nothing more than an insult to the American people, that runs forty minutes too long, and just goes around in circles, it's not something I'd recommend wasting your time on."" ]"

The story itself is very inspirational and the acting is top notch. This isn't just a good film, it's one that you know took a lot out of everyone involved.

freedomland;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Exploring racism and police misconduct in a mixed neighborhood, Freedomland had ambitious goals and tried to tell it's story without taking a position. As the film moves forward, it becomes very clear which way the films writers are leaning, and it defeats the films intended purpose. Julianna Moore plays a woman who claims she was carjacked in the black part of town. Samuel L. Jackson, one of the detectives assigned to the area, goes to investigate, and when he interviews the victim, she drops a bombshell, telling Jackson that her 5 year old son was in the car. We all know that Samuel L. Jackson is a legend and he performed like one in this film, but the problem was Julianne Moore. I get that she's playing a mother who is missing her kid, but she was so whiny and out of it the whole film, that every scene she was in was just painful to watch. Add to that the fact that she's trying to use some southern redneck accent, and she was barely understandable. A white woman claiming her child was kidnapped by a black man is the premise of the film and leads to the police putting down the hammer on the black part of town. It was a story that could have gone in so many terrific directions, but instead it falls flat on it's face, with nonsensical sub-plots, shotty performances, and of course a writer who did anything but tell his story objectively. The investigative part of the film was pretty interesting and Samuel L. Jackson is always great, but overall Freedomland is a cliche, that plays on racial conflict in order to get people to watch it."" ]"

I saw this film when it first came out and was less than impressed, still I'm constantly hearing about the film and decided to give it a second chance, to see if I was missing something. What I always admired about this film, was that Adam Sandler finally gave his underlings the chance to shine. With experience comes knowledge, and the possibility of being more than just one liners in the middle of one of his films, that was the hope anyway. The story follows an adult game tester named Alex (Allen Covert), who is forced to move in with his Grandmother and become part of her Golden Girls lifestyle. Along with her and her roommates, there are several funny moments, but nothing to write home about. The rest of this film just isn't that funny! Most films about losers, connect to the audience and make you pull for them in the end, but when it comes to Alex, I just really didn't care all that much. In typical Sandler form, there is a girl and some weird conspiracy involved, but the whole thing wasn't even good enough for the man who starred in Jack & Jill, so to call it one of the funniest movies of all time, it isn't even close. It's evident to see what the writers were going for, but the fact of the matter is, that the characters just aren't that interesting, and the film isn't raunchy or slap-stick enough to be anything more than a passing memory."" ]"

The film shows one fictional groups encounter with this man and shows just how twisted some people can be. If this were a fictional slasher film, I'd call it nothing special. The fact that it's based on real events and knowing that a lot of this stuff actually happened, make the movie especially creepy. As far as I'm concerned, the creepier the better!"" ]"

The book was written by one of a families ten children, about their mother and how she raised their entire family by winning sweepstakes, which were extremely popular in the 50's and 60's. The Ryan family was your typical suburban family, Kelly (Woody Harrelson) worked in a mill and spends most of his paycheck on alcohol. That leaves Evelyn (Julianna Moore) to raise 10 kids on almost no money. Evelyn was in advertising before she became a housewife and had a knack for writing slogans and jingles. As a result of her circumstances, she entered every contest she could find and surprisingly won a large number of them, despite the odds. She won the house they live in, as well as most of the appliances, and even a few cars they sold. The story was truly fantastic and a wonderful tribute to a woman, who in some ways could be considered a modern day working mother. Evelyn was played by Julianna Moore, who gives the performance of her life. Once again, an independent film is overlooked by the Academy, but had this been a major release, there is no doubt in my mind that Moore would have won the Oscar, she is really that good. A good portion of the story is focused on this extraordinary woman, but we do meet her husband and we see her kids at various ages and walks of live. It seems like a movie that could quickly fizzle out, but life is never slow or boring in the Kelly household. On a side note, the author of the book, Evelyn's oldest daughter really made a name for herself with this book and made a cameo at the end of the film. Unfortunately, her career was short lived, as she passed away shortly after the films release. The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio is the kind of tribute we'd all love to give our parents, but most of our parents didn't do the extraordinary things Evelyn Ryan did.

John Cusack stars and he can make any film better. This guy can play anyone and is always amazing, I just can't understand why he doesn't take on bigger roles. Here he's paired with Billy Bob Thornton, who under the right circumstances, can be hilarious. While he was pretty funny, he has almost no chemistry with Cusack and that hurt the film. These guys were partners, but on completely opposite pages and it just doesn't work.

north-country;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Sexual harassment wasn't a concern in the work place until 1984, when the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit was brought against the owners of a mine in Minnesota. This is the story told in the award winning film, North Country, which graphically shows the horrors these women had to face at work on a daily basis. Charlize Theron was amazing, portraying Josey Aimes, the woman who finally stood up and said enough is enough. Theron is the kind of actress who is usually overlooked because of the roles she takes. I had a difficult time judging what kind of an actress she really was until seeing her in the role of a lifetime. Portraying Aimes as realistically as possible, Theron really made the audience feel the struggle of a single mother, having to take a difficult job, just to put food on the table. We see how the harassment at work effected every aspect of her life and it actually changed my view on sexual harassment. As harsh as it sounds, I always viewed sexual harassment as a law created by people who were too serious and couldn't take a joke, but the story of Josey Aimes is no joke. No person, male or female, of any color, race, or sexuality, should ever have to face even half of what Aimes had to go through. This example is how you know that North Country is one amazing film, because any movie that can change a persons opinion on a subject, is worth it's weight in gold. Theron isn't the only gem in this film, as France McDormand also received an Oscar nomination for her role as a co-worker suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. I also thought that Woody Harrelson deserved recognition for his portrayal of the attorney who represented the women. In 1984, there had never been a case like this, and for him to go out on a limb for something like this was truly special, and its reflected in his performance. From top to bottom this film is very solid, the cast is terrific, and the story is a historically accurate portrayal of sadly, a much overlooked moment in American judicial history. North Country is the kind of film that I truly believe every child should see before entering the work force for the first time. It is that powerful and also earns a spot on our list of must see movies!"" ]"

Harlin is a legend in the world of action films, responsible for such films as Die Hard 2, 12 Rounds, & The Long Kiss Goodnight. He usually doesn't waste his time on direct-to-video films, and prefers to feature his own people, but the story here was so good, that he must of made an exception. Mind Hunters follows seven FBI agents who are training to be profilers, under the watch of the toughest trainer there ever was, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer). For their final test, the group goes to a small island the navy uses for training, and must work together in order to catch a serial killer that doesn't exist or do they? Once they begin their investigation, the group quickly come to realize that the scene is booby trapped and they are cut off from the outside world, trapped on an island with a killer. While having a unique location and a terrific director, what I really enjoyed about this film was how it was more than just some slasher film. This group isn't just a bunch of frat girls running from a guy in a hockey mask, they are trained, intelligent, FBI agents, trying to figure out which one of them is responsible for setting the rest up. This film features all the fighting, gun battles, and chases that you get in a typical action thriller, but there is also a methodical obsession among the group to find the one that betrayed them, and for that this film is unique. Kathryn Morris stars and has more than enough experience playing a detective, after sever years on Cold Case. Likewise LL Cool J has played a cop on numerous occasions, most recently on NCIS: Los Angles. Going into the film, I wasn't all that crazy about this cast, but once I got into it, I realized that they were brought together, because all of these guys have plays cops, FBI agents, or some kind of law enforcer in the past. That mix of unique personalities and experience help this film, because what the cast lacks in talent, they make up for with experience. Mind Hunters isn't something you've never seen before, but it brings together several different common themes in a new way and it will keep you on the edge of your seat."" ]"

Seeing a big name you really like, who is not listed in the credits, show up even for a small role, it always adds to the enjoyment of the film. This is not the kind of movie that is going to win any awards.

The story this time isn't centered around some mysterious artifact or person, but rather a world wide competition of student wizards. The Goblet of Fire decides who the best of the best are, allowing only one student from each school to participate. This film was special, but also lacked some of the intrigue that got us addicted to Harry Potter in the first place. Finally, a Harry Potter film focuses entirely on Harry and we get to see some of the great things that he is supposedly capable of. In fact, Ron and Hairmony's roles amount to little more than bit parts, where as in the other three films, they were all on equal ground. The fact that this was a competition takes something major away from the film. In the Goblet of Fire we aren't introduced to any new artifacts, games, or spells, there really isn't anything here that will amaze you. While it's a small thing, it's an expected thing, that does take something away from the film. What makes up for it is a terrific ending, that has to be seen in order to continue on with the series. For years, I thought Harry Potter was just overrated, pop culture, bull  but once I sat down to actually watch it, I came to realize that this series is as magically as the world it portrays. Every one of the first four films has been fantastic and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the wizards of Hogwarts."" ]"

A lot of really stupid moments, that only they get, and moments of pure comic genius. Team America is your typical mix of both. What makes this movie amazing is that they do it all with puppets. Everything from action sequences to sex scenes are all done entirely with puppets. Their songs are hysterical as usual and the characters are great, but unlike most Parker and Stone movies, The story isn't very strong. To be honest, it got really old, really fast, and by the end, I couldn't wait for it to be over. You should see it for its funny moments, but overall it's not their best work."" ]"

I am also a big fan of the lead in this movie Jonathan Jackson. Together I was expecting a can't miss movie, but it didn't quite work out that way. Riding The Bullet is just all around dull. The story was weak to begin with, the flashbacks were dull, the characters have 0 personality, and it just wasn't creepy in the slightest! If Disney made horror movies, they would be similar to this.

This was a necessity for the film, Zero Day, which gives an in depth look at the psyche of two school shooters. The story isn't unexpected or anything you haven't seen before, but what makes this film unique is how the producers went about casting this film. The entire cast is made up of ordinary kids, with no previous acting experience, to that end, the entire immediate family of the shooters are also used in the film. Given that these kids weren't actors at the time, a lot of scenes also remain unscripted. The kids were told to just talk about things that make being a teenager tough, expressing dark, innermost feelings of rage and hatred of society. It was then that the writers wrote dialogue that corresponded with what these kids were saying. The result of this is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen. It was like actually being able to watch the video diaries of the Columbine shooters, expressing their feelings, and explaining their actions, prior to that tragic day. Both boys featured in the film are terrific and the way the Director just let the story flow, based on what these two kids had to say, was absolutely ingenious. I think this film was an amazing insight into the minds of troubled teenagers and I think it's a must see for anyone in the field of education."" ]"

Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban."" ]"
philadelphia;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Philadelphia will always hold a place in cinematic history, as it is the first major film to really address the discrimination against Aids and Homosexuality. It also was the beginning of Tom Hanks amazing run of Academy nominated film, that may never be duplicated. The message of the film comes across loud and clear, but not quite in the way that the film's producers intended. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) was a top attorney with one of Philadelphia's top law firms, when all of a sudden he's fired. Beckett believes he was set up and fired because he has Aids, but can he prove it in court? As the film goes, it is easy to see the discrimination and stereotypes that Beckett has to face on a daily basis, and weather or not you accept homosexuality, it's powerful ending will make you feel for the plight of any homosexual who suffers from this horrible disease. The majority of this film takes place in the courtroom and centers around Beckett's case against his former employer, and as someone who has studied the law, I can tell you that the case destroyed the merits of this film. There are things that both sides do, that would never be allowed in a court of law, and in my opinion neither side really makes it's case. As far as the legal aspect of this trial goes, it is very subjective and would never lead to the verdict that was handed down. As for the stars of this film, they are the ones that make it as powerful as it was. Hanks gives a performance that was absolutely worthy of the best actor award, as following him and his story is really what gave the film it's reputation. Quite ingeniously, Hanks is paired with Denzel Washington, who plays his attorney. Washington's character is meant to represent how much of the audience felt at that time, as even while representing Beckett, he speaks out about Aids and Homosexuality. The more he works to represent Beckett, the more you can see his attitude change, the same way the audiences attitudes change as the film moves alone. I loved Philadelphia for it's performances and it's message, but as far as the story goes, the trial is the majority of the film, and the trial is completely unbelievable. In my opinion the trial takes away much of the film credibility. The issue and the case should have been more clear cut and the legality of it all should have been easier for the audience to understand. That being said, if you choose to watch this film, you will be hard pressed to find better performances by a better cast, but the story will leave you feeling somewhat incomplete."" ]"
the-manchurian-candidate;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The remake of The Manchurian Candidate is one of the few Denzel Washington films I've never seen. To be honest, the story just didn't interest me that much, but it started streaming this month, so I gave it a shot. As expected, it's a someone complex story, that at times was difficult to understand, however an all-star cast manages to pull it together at the end. The story begins in Iraq during the Gulf War, when a U.S. Army platoon goes missing for three days. Even they were unaware of what happened to them, until one of the men starts having nightmares, and bodies start turning up. Denzel Washington plays the commanding officer, who takes it upon himself to investigate the strange deaths of his men, almost a decade later. As always, Washington is at the top of his game, giving off that infectious intensity, that keeps you on the edge of your seat through every step of the investigation. Washington is paired with Liev Schreiber who is one guy that has always just rubbed me the wrong way. It's not that he's a bad actor, there is just something about him and the characters he plays that is inherently unlikeable. He wasn't bad in this film, but being a similarly intense actor, meant that the chemistry with Washington was almost non-existent. The story is complicated and in the beginning of the film, it's going to be somewhat hard to watch. As the film proceeds and the elements become more clear, the film gets easier to watch, and the ending really pulls everything together. The Manchurian Candidate is one of those films that you think is going to be a bust, some people may even turn it off, but those who stick with it will see that it just gets better and better until a surprise ending brings it all together. If I were the writer of this film, I would have made the beginning of the film more intense and less confusing. The truth is the most important parts of a film are the beginning and the end, and without a strong opening, a lot of people will be turned off to the film and have the wrong attitude throughout. If you manage to stick with it, The Manchurian Candidate is great, but it does take a while to get there."" ]"

Little Manhattan was however the film that got him started. It's a simple story about a ten year old boy and his first love. Basically, I saw it as Sex In The City from the adolescent males point of view. (It even features Cynthia Nixon and Willie Garson.) The film was cute, but it should have been so much better. The kids were acting way way WAY too mature for ten year olds. I was a ten year old boy once and nothing like THAT ever crossed my mind. The parts are written for much older kids, nevertheless, Hutcherson and Charlie Ray both do a fantastic job with their respective roles.

While one is trapped in hard hit New York City, the other must track across the country to save him. Okay, it's a little cheesy and the acting isn't the best, but the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. I like that it's based on fact and a look into a possible future, well beyond my lifetime and overall it was extremely entertaining. Many of my fellow reviews considered the film to be a warning on global warming, but that's really crazy. Unless you're Al Gore, you should see this movie for what it is.

Seething with anger and thinking about revenge, Tom starts scouting local gay bars until he finds Dan (James Marsden). As soon as he sees him, Tom starts flirting and convinces Dan to go home with him, where Tom ties him to a chair and tells him they've met before. After obtaining a blood sample, Tom lets Dan know that when that test comes back, if Dan is positive also, he's going to die. The film is based on an award winning play and I venture to say as a play, this would have been terrific. On the big screen however, the same raw emotion isn't as evident and the story doesn't have much in the way of variety. The 24th Day is very narrowly focused, and after it's initial abduction and reveal, it becomes quite boring, as both the men and the audience prepare for the ending. In transferring this story to film, I feel as though something more should have been added to story. Maybe some flashbacks or an unintended visitor, just something to break up the monotony. Both Scott Speedman and James Marsden are very good in their respect roles and I really enjoyed both the beginning and end of this film, unfortunately the middle is somewhat boring and takes away from an otherwise original and outstanding story."" ]"

While the story has some tremendous performances, it really lacks any substance, rehashing the events of the past week, over and over again. We know right from the beginning of the film, that Leland killed a retard boy, what we don't know is why. The focus of the film is discovering what lead this highly intelligent, son of a celebrity, to commit such an act. The film has a huge cast of celebrities, that include Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Chris Klein, and Michelle Williams, all of whom are as good as you would expect. What the film has in talent, it lacks in substance, as it's really just a whole lot of Leland talking in code. The writers go out of their way to show Leland as this deep, emotionless kid, that's been trapped inside his own mind his entire life. As the film goes on, the more Leland opens up. The writers paint the portrait of this kid and show you ever aspect of his life, in the hopes that you will figure out his true motivation before it comes out. The result is a slow moving film that causes the audience to gradually lose interest as time goes on. There is no doubt the Ryan Gosling was spectacular and deserves every good thing said about his performance, but the story seems to move slowly and in circles. The writers made it much more in depth than it had to be and most audiences will be turned off by it."" ]"
the-punisher;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The problem with this movie was that it couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, and this ultimately led to its downfall at the box office. The beginning of the film is really intense and it seems like it's going to be one of those, 'it could happen in real life' comic book adaptations. After the first half hour though, that's gone and replaced with the typical unrealistic bull  This film also couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be PG-13 or R. Ultimately it got the R rating and has the violence that goes with it, but clearly the producers were hoping for the PG-13, and have some really childish parts to it. I hate when that happens, make up your mind! If you're going to be violent and crazy, then go all out, and if not, tone it down and get the PG-13. When they mix both styles, they don't appeal to a larger audience, they appeal to a smaller one. The cast did an adequate job, the story was alright, and the action was pretty cool, but there really isn't much here."" ]"
hellboy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Much like the Punisher, Hellboy was created for the older comic book fans. The character was designed to be an anti-hero, less refined than Batman or Superman, someone who would hate being labeled a superhero. While the comics weren't as popular as others, the film gave life to the franchise and created a cult following. The story is meant to introduce us to the character of Hellboy, a cat loving, cigar smoking, red guy, with a bad attitude, who secretly works for the government protecting The United States from paranormal threats. Everyone knows by now that I hate superheroes, so the idea of the anti-hero really appealed to me. I could have easily become one of the cult followers and fallen for Hellboy, the way all the comic-con kids did, if it wasn't for the uncertain direction of the film. Guillermo Del Toro struggled back and fourth with whether or not this film should be geared for kids or adults, and went the PG-13 route. It worked in terms of getting a larger audience, but it also took away from the original intent of the character. Throughout the film we keep hearing about how tough and dangerous Hellboy is, but he's really wasn't that much of a bad ass. If Hellboy is so unlike any hero, why is he working for government instead of breaking the law, and why is it that he doesn't utter a single curse word? The character was far too toned down for my liking, but the flip-side to that was how nasty and creepy some of the bad guys were. Broom is one of the best comic villains I've ever seen and given his Nazi background, he most certainly was not intended for kids. Overall, I enjoyed parts of the film, I loved Ron Perlman, and as with any film by Guillermo Del Toro, the special effects were amazing. However, the lack of direction makes the film somewhat unfulfilling and anti-climatic. Hopefully that will all change when I get up to Hellboy II."" ]"

The only reason I liked this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, I love Jones and he once again shows that he can carry a film on his back. He's done it before, he'll do it again, and he did it here. Without Jones, this movie stinks, it's his distinctive, energetic, and authoritative personality which makes this film interesting. The movie is utterly ridiculous, yet Jones keeps you interested.

As for Topher Grace, he plays this whiny, love struck, jealous friend of Kate Bosworth, and he wasn't really that funny either. Win A Date With Tad Hamilton seemed like someones attempt at making a Woody Allen film and ultimately they failed. This film just tries too hard and gets to a point where it isn't funny.

The end of the film went from extremely predictable to ridiculously strange and confusing. While I'm sure the ending made perfect sense to the Wachowski's, it made no sense to me, an avid science fiction fan and movie critic. This being a review, means I can't go into specifics, but the ending was absolutely horrible and puts the whole series in a different light. The most disheartening part of this whole thing is that until that point, the Matrix has been done to near perfection. The story was solid, the action was out of this world, the special effects were amazing, the casting was flawless, and just when the trilogy should have reached it's apex, it all comes crashing down. Once again the cast is terrific and the story is great, which is why I don't understand how they could give us an ending like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and it will certainly hold it's place in cinematic history, but as a fan I was horribly disappointed by an ending that came out of nowhere and left the audience scratching it's head."" ]"

Due to the popularity of his work in film and how successful they've been, even a lesser known work like Paycheck has been made into a film. The story includes many of the action sequences and interesting characters associated with Dick's stories, but Paycheck does lack the futuristic Science Fiction that has become Dick's signature, which is the main reason this story isn't as well known as his other works. The story takes place in modern day, where a man is offered an irresistible deal. Jennings (Ben Affleck) is told that if he works on a secret project for the next 3 years, he will receive 100 million dollars. The only catch being that after the 3 years are up, Jennings memory will be erased and he will have no idea what he worked on. As expected, Jennings accepts the deal and returns to his life 3 years later, but nothing is that simple. Soon everyone from the FBI to bounty hunters show up trying to get to him, and the only clues he has come from an envelope he sent himself, containing 19 random items that seem to have little or no value. Ben Affleck stars and by this point we all know how I feel about him. Affleck is a terrific Director, who seems to have little interest in acting anymore. Paycheck however is a 2003 film, a time before Affleck had proven himself and he shows that rare charisma that is only present in his real early work. His performance is outstanding and aided further by his chemistry with co-star Uma Thurman. Thurman is another performer who I find isn't very good unless she's in very specific type of role, and fortunately for Affleck, this is one of those roles. Paycheck is missing the big signature associated with Dick's work and will be somewhat disappointing to his fans. I did miss the futuristic element, but I was intrigued by the mystery Jennings was trying to solve and the 19 items. Combined with the action sequences, (that are always top notch) Paycheck isn't what I expected, but was still very well done and definitely worth watching."" ]"

I've said it before and I'll say it again, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the single most underrated and under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. I've seen a lot of his films, some are great and some are awful, but the fact remains that he always gives a strong performance and makes even the worst movie that much better. Manic was a rare inside look at a youth psychiatric facility, but there wasn't much of a story behind it. Of course we meet Lyle and the other patients, finding out why they're there, but there really isn't a point to it. The quality of the film further decreases with the way it was filmed, as every scene features constant movement from numerous angles. Similar to these camcorder films, I honestly found it pretty distracting, not to mention nauseating. The best part of Manic though is clearly the performances. This was released in 2001, before any of the stars were household names, however after seeing the film, it's easy to see why they all became popular. Don Cheadle is another actor that doesn't get the recognition he deserves, playing the Doctor in Manic, he is the glue that brings everyone together. Even with JGL's performance, this film is a mess of nonsense without Don Cheadle. Manic is somewhat disturbing and filmed in a way that makes it hard to watch, but the performances are just about as good as it gets and make this film worth seeing."" ]"

Chief Whitlock is not your typical Denzel role, and while he played it the best that he could, I just feel like it didn't suit him very well. The location of the movie didn't make a whole lot of sense, and that wasn't the only thing. Why would a detective from Miami and his ex-wife be investigating a crime an hour away in some small town? Miami PD isn't the FBI. The movie has a lot of plot holes and everything that happens is fairly obvious. It's entertaining, but it's not going to blow anyone away."" ]"

It most defiantly doesn't live up to the original, but surprisingly it wasn't terrible. Eric Christian Olson does a terrific job as Lloyd, the story of how they met, as well as references to the original, and the cameos make this film worth seeing.

keeping-up-with-the-steins;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Being Jewish, I have a bias towards liking a film like this. The usage of Yiddish, along with the many exaggerations of the Jewish family are something most people won't understand, unless they grew up around it. Parts of this film I found to be hysterical, while my non-Jewish friend, sitting next to me, didn't get it at all. As for the film, it's a lie before the credits even stop rolling. Keeping Up With The Steins, really has very little to due with the Stein family, as they are part of the background story at best. The film is actually about a broken family, forced together on the eve of a child's Bar Mitzvah. Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) is turning 13, which in the Jewish religion means that he is about to become a man. His parents are well off and are making huge plans for the event, but Ben wants no part of it. In an attempt to take the attention off himself, he sends an invitation to his estranged Grandfather that he's never met, a Grandfather, who shows up to the families wealthy neighborhood in an old RV, with a woman half his age. This is where the heart of the story comes from, as father and son are forced together after fifteen years. Jeremy Piven stars as the son and believe it or not he's a big time Hollywood agent, living in a life of luxury. This toned down version of Ari is forced to see his father, played by the legendary Garry Marshall. For the past 15 years, he's been living as a hippie,  teaching on an Indian reservation. As soon as they see each other the two are at odds and it really is very funny. The star of the film is Spy Kids, Daryl Sabara, who I have never liked. He's just always so shy and painfully awkward, I really just don't understand his appeal. While he is a major part of the story, the parts of the film that feature him without Marshall or Piven are just painful. Keeping Up With The Steins isn't raunchy and much of the humor is intertwined in the Jewish religion. If you're not Jewish, you'll probably have the same reaction my friend did. Personally I loved it, but I can understand how this film won't appeal to everybody."" ]"

the-matrix-reloaded;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""Contrary to everything we know about trilogies, the sequel to the Matrix is considered to be the best of the three films. The reason is simple, as this is where we get into the heart of the story. The first film was equivalent to the pilot episode of a TV show, where we are introduced to the characters, terms, and locations. In the second installment of the Matrix we are introduced to the real struggle and get a look inside the legendary underground city of Zion. The humans there have learned of a plan by the machines to tunnel through into the city and want to come up with a way to stop them. While Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to stopping the whole thing, most of the other are skeptical. In Reloaded, Agent Smith doesn't play as large a role as in the first film, for that matter, neither does the Matrix itself, which makes it almost like a stand alone rather than a sequel. Reloaded isn't just a great Sci-Fi story as it features one of the best action sequences and chase scenes I have ever seen, following the groups interaction with the Merovingian. While the film was great and does top the original, the Directors once again tried to use never before seen special effects. While it worked well in the first film, it doesn't help the second. Many of the fight scenes with the agents become so computerized, that at points they actually seem to be animated, and those scenes hurt the film. Other than that minor inconvenience, I can't find anything wrong with this film. It is Science Fiction at it's best, featuring an perfectly cast group of actors, some edge of your seat intensity, and of course a very unique story. All that makes the Matrix Reloaded one of our must see movies!"" ]"

He has no idea what's going on, but soon learns the horrible truth. Boyle decide to film the movie as if he were following this stranger from a distance, with an outdated camcorder. It gives the movie a grainy, dark, 70's style and fits right into the story. Cillian Murphy is great in his first leading role and you can see why he's now a name in Hollywood. Overall, it's pretty bloody and predictable, but defiantly not your typical end of the world film. The acting is top notch and the way it was filmed and directed make it something special."" ]"
54;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Okay, most people wouldn't admit it, but I will. I only watched this movie for the graphic sex and nudity. Based on the trailer, I was expecting a giant orgy, filled with drugs and dance music, but to my surprise, 54 actually turned out to be a docudrama about Club 54, as seen through the eyes of a young waiter/bar tender/dancer. The film features the shady practices of the owner, the drug trade inside, the celebrity guests, and of course the eccentric regulars, in what turns out to be one hell of an entertaining film (...and the sex and nudity don't hurt either). Ryan Phillippe stars in a role that today I could never see him taking, but back in his younger days, he really excelled in. The way he was able to demonstrate how the exposure to a place like that can change a person, was truly remarkable. He literally went from nothing to a face that was known all over the city, simply because he was a waiter at 54. It went to his head and changed the whole dynamic of his life and relationship with his family. For as good as he was though, Mike Myers was the real star of the film, portraying famed owner Steve Rubell. Rubell's life was just one big party and he never slowed down or cared about what he was doing or saying publicly, and we all know how that turned out in the long run. Myers is one of those actors who is out of this world when he's cast in the right role, and terrible when he's not, but much as the case with Austin Powers, this role fit him like a glove. On the surface, 54 is a wild, raunchy film that is going to offend a lot of people, I don't suggest watching it with your grandparents. It does however, tell a very relevant and historically accurate story of the drug and youth culture of the mid-late 1970s in the big cities. 54 is sexy, entertaining, and informative, a mix that you don't often see on the big screen."" ]"

Shia LaBeouf is great as a troubled kid sent away to a work camp, where they uncover a hidden secret. Surprisingly thou, it's newcomer Khleo Thomas who steals the show. His story and background are so sad and he plays it so well, that you just want to hug him every time he opens his mouth. Veterans John Voigt and Sigourney Weaver bring experience to the film and really give the kids a strong example to follow now and in the future.

I hope to find some young talent, before anyone else knows who they are, a unique story, and a funny scene or two. Unfortunately, the story here is quite disgusting and there weren't any stand out performances, but there was a really funny scene, where the nerdy kid gets caught playing dance dance revolution. The story begins when a new kid named Billy (Luke Benward) moves to town. The other kids immediately try to intimidate him, by replacing his lunch with a bag of worms. To their surprise, in defiance, Billy eats the worms and gains their respect. One thing leads to another and eventually a very disgusting competition is born. The film is based on a very popular children's book and that's really who this film was intended for. Occasionally, you get some surprises out of a film like this, but as I said earlier, there really wasn't any stand out talent here. I didn't find any young actors/actresses that I could start following from the beginning of their career, but the kids weren't bad either. They seemed to have a lot of fun with the strange story and ultimately I think kids will probably really enjoy it.

I also wanted to catch the original film, before its reputation was irreparably damaged by next years re-make, featuring the Rock, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart. The film focuses on young Alan Parrish (Robin Williams), the son of a rich industrialist, who is always in the way. One day, he finds a weird board game, buried in a construction site, and decides to play with a friend, but this is no ordinary game, and Alan becomes trapped inside for decades. It isn't until two kids, moving into a new house discover the game and start to play it, that Alan is freed. Not wanting these kids, to face the same fate he did, they track down his old friend, and decide to finish the game and put the madness to an end. I think when Robin Williams played a child or a crazy person he was at his best. Those were the time when he could really just let go, be free, and be truly hilarious. As in most films like this, Williams is the film, the rest of the cast revolves around him, and without him, this is just another kids movie. Kids love these quirky, weird films, and parents hate being dragged to them, but Williams had a way of making both sides happy and making them both want to see it, that's what Jumanji was. For all intense and purposes this is a kids movie, with Williams acting like a big kid, but making adult jokes, innuendoes, and just being that guy who made him a legend."" ]"

He has no intention of turning them in, but when he won't take the money, everyone just assumes he already did, making Frank a target that has to act in order to save his own life.

The combination of Al Pacino's infectious personality and Sidney Lumet's methodical and innovative story telling. At the time Serpico was made, Al Pacino was the brightest star in Hollywood and for good reason, he just has a way of getting people behind whatever character and project he's associated with. As for Lumet, he is known as an innovative director for simply trying things that everyone had available to them. Lumet uses different angles and close ups to make things more intense and exciting, as well as methodically going deeper into the story.

I suppose when Joel Shumacher is directing an all-star cast, anything, even an entire movie that takes place in a phone booth, can be interesting! Colin Farrell stars as a man who lies, cheats, and does anything it takes to get to the top of his profession. He thinks he's on top of the world, with a wife, a girlfriend, and a group of clients, who don't know what scum he is, but someone has noticed the real Stu Shepard and has trained a rifle on him. Shepard has to do as he is told or risk becoming yet another victim, of a man who has been targeting New York City's businessmen. Colin Farrell is a very versatile actor, it's always been his biggest strength, but generally I find his performances to be kind of flat. Farrell has never been someone who I would consider a top tier Hollywood actor, but looking back on this early performance, I have to tell you, I was impressed. The setting of the film was so limited, that the only way it works is if you have a strong and believable cast, which Phone Booth certainly has. Every character has a unique back story and everyone is interconnected, in a film that is full of intrigue and edge of your seat action. People may not know what a phone booth is anymore, but this film is far from outdated. It is an excellent edge of your seat thrill ride that is perfect for the person who wants a short, but exciting movie."" ]"

Chelios goes out seeking revenge, but must keep his adrenaline pumping, in order to slow the poison down. It's a strange story, but as usual, Statham is terrific, playing his most extreme character. Chelios is a crazy man who goes to extremes, however that's all this film has to offer. Non-stop action can sometimes be fun, but when it's the same thing repeating over and over again for 90 minutes, even the biggest action fan gets tired of it. Statham is paired with Amy Smart who starred in my favorite movie of all-time, The Butterfly Effect, and surprisingly she was terrible! She plays Chelios's girlfriend, a girl who is as dumb as dirt and who follows this crazy man blindly through the city on his hunt for revenge. Crank has some humor and a terrific leading man, but unfortunately, there isn't much of story. Besides Statham's well known one-liners and his ridiculous moves, there is really nothing to see here. Crank is one of those films that starts out strong and then just never goes anywhere. Having seen a lot of Statham's movies lately, I was hoping his best known film would be his most exciting, but it wasn't. It's the same scene repeated many times over, and I was tired of it after a half hour."" ]"

He's given a role that suites him perfectly and he mumbles and relies on the rest of the cast to carry him. In the future, emotions and things that evoke emotions are outlawed, and Bale is one of the men responsible for enforcing these laws, but he soon turns to the other side, when he accidentally feels an emotion for the first time. Bale is a cold guy to begin with. He never shows much emotion even when his role calls for it, so aside from Keanu Reeves, he was the best choice for this role. The story was a little out there and the effects were over the top, but it's Bale himself who puts the icing on the turd cake. He's completely dependent on his fellow cast members and the ridiculous special effects his character is given.

When seeing a Todd Phillips comedy, that is unrated, and features Billy Bob Thornton, you should expect to see a raunchy good time, but that's not what happens here. To Phillips, keeping as close to the original story was more important than modernizing it for today's audiences, and the result was a film that fails to live up to expectations. This film needed a major injection of raunch, the kind Thornton became known for in films like Bad Santa. Instead you get what amounts to an average, mediocre, comedy. In this film, Thornton is paired with Jon Heder, Napoleon Dynamite himself, but as with that film, his monotone lovable loser act, gets old very quickly.

While it was a great film, it was very dark and fails to deliver the emotional impact that it intended to have on it's audience. In the 1930s, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man living in the suburban mid-west. By all accounts, he is a normal man, who is hiding one very dark secret, he is a hit-man for an organized crime syndicate. His secret is safe and life continues on as usual until one day, his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses his father execute someone. Sullivan assures his bosses that everything is fine and his son won't say anything, but when has the mob ever taken that chance? Sullivan and his family are targeted for elimination and only he and his son manage to escape to Chicago, where he plans his revenge. As with most films based on a novel, the story here is top notch and very well written. Tom Hanks is the premier actor of our time, a man who will be remembered for centuries, but was he really the right choice to play Michael Sullivan? Hanks has many amazing skills as an actor, but playing such a cold, sedentary character, Hanks is unable to use his many tools and gives a performance that is very dry. The audience simply doesn't relate to Sullivan the way they relate to his son, and that brings the emotional impact of the film way below what it was intended to be. Tyler Hoechlin is fairly well known now, but when he got this role, it was his first, and he beat out over 10,000 other kids to get it. I don't know who any of those other kids were, but Hoechlin couldn't have had much competition, because he was out of this world good. It's a shame that the Academy rarely recognizes kids and that Paul Newman got the Best Supporting Actor nod over Hoechlin, because this kid is really the only one who comes off in a way that the writers originally intended. Road To Perdition was a tremendous story and was full of award winning actors, but the star power was more important to the producers, then finding actors who fit the characters as they were written. Aside from that and a painfully predictable ending, that you have to see coming, this was a pretty good film.

minority-report;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Most people don't recognize the name Phillip K. Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed."" ]"

She wants to know if it's real and if it is wants to pay the family for her husband's mistakes. The investigation takes Welles down a deep dark road that few travel and even less know about. The story is just so dark and creepy that some of you might actually be freaked out by it!

the-thirteenth-floor;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""The Thirteenth Floor was Columbia Pictures answer to the Matrix and is based on the award winning 1964 Sci-Fi novel, Simulacron 3 by Daniel Galouye. I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law  Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality. The Thirteenth Floor is a fresh story with an amazing cast that will make you think, movies like this don't come along as often as they should!"" ]"
memory;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Memory is one of the best direct-to-video/b-movies I have ever seen. How a small production company gets a cast like this is beyond me, but this was just a great movie! Billy Zane is a guy with a clouded past, who decides to use an experimental drug to restore his memory. Only to vividly remember a murder he witnessed, but was it his memory or someone else's? I don't like Zane one bit, but in this movie, he's pure genius. What was really striking about this film, (especially since it's a low budget b-movie), was the imagery. Everything is so vibrate and methodically done. First time director, Bennett Davlin, really has you sitting on the edge of your seat. It really feels like you're alongside Zane, seeing what he sees. As for the ending, I never saw it coming. I've seen a lot of films, and you've got to have a pretty good story to surprise me! It's a film you've never heard of and won't see in theaters, but it's defiantly one that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

It was the perfect balance of comedy and drama, that kept you interested throughout. There were also flashes of animation that just added to the story and made it even better. It's hard to describe this movie without spoilers, but I would defiantly suggest you take a chance and check it out!"" ]"
insomnia;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Insomnia was the second major motion picture by acclaimed writer/director, Christopher Nolan. Even in the most early stages of his career, it's easy to see his genius, that's why so many big stars wanted to work with him right away. Insomnia is the least well known of all his films and does lack some of the things that have become Nolan's trademark, but it's still a terrific film. The story follows two L.A. Detectives sent to a remote part of Alaska, where the sun doesn't set for six months and then doesn't rise for six months. They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path. Despite being one of the best Hollywood has to offer, I haven't really been much of a Pacino fan. To me, it seemed as though he had lost something with age, his performance in Insomnia proved me wrong. Terrific is not the word for what Al Pacino was and he's not the only genius Nolan surrounded himself with. This film is incredibly well written and being the perfectionist that he is, Nolan got only the best people to star in it. It's not the kind of Nolan film, we've been spoiled with over the past 10 years, but Insomnia is a great story, with an unbelievable cast and in my opinion is a must see."" ]"

It was the story of trust and redemption that centers not around Georgia and her rules, but rather around her granddaughter played by Lindsey Lohan. I don't like Lohan, her previous roles, or even how she is as a person, but in this movie, she's terrific. I think it's because she was actually playing herself. A smart but troubled girl, who acts slutty and stupid to keep up appearances and hide from her own misery. This movie was smart and funny as well as deep and emotional.

Frailty doesn't have any of that. It's like watching one of these lame reality shows, that takes place inside some families home. Until the end nothing happens! ...finally you get to the end and you see something! My reaction to it was, 'that was it, that's what you were building up to this whole time!?'

captivity;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Saw meets Hostel in this entertaining, but painfully predictable film. Elisha Cuthbert is the difference between Captivity and the dozens of lame horror movies produced every year. Don't get me wrong, Captivity is full of gore and has a ridiculously stupid storyline, but it's not that bad, and Cuthbert is the reason. The veteran actress, best known as Kim Bauer and The Girl Next Door, is very methodical with every move she makes and that really manages to keep your attention. The maze of traps, moving walls, and pitfalls were also really cool, but outside of that and Cuthbert, Captivity is your typical gore fest, with zero character development, and a chilling story that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I liked it for the little things, but overall, there's nothing special here, just another lame horror movie, that happened to land the right star."" ]"

impostor;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""Impostor is one of the lesser known stories by the master of Science Fiction, Philip K. Dick. It is so unknown, that one of his biggest fans, didn't even realize that this film was based on a story by Dick, until I saw it in the credits. As usual, the story is out of this world, as it takes place in the distance future, a future where the Earth is at war with an alien species. This species has the ability to clone humans in such a realistic way, that it is nearly impossible to detect them. Special military investigator, Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio), is tasked with figuring out who has been replaced. On the eve of a big announcement by the President, Hathaway intercepts a transmission claiming that her top military adviser, Dr. Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise), has been replaced. When Hathaway confronts Olham, he claims to have no knowledge of this, and unlike previous replicates, he has memories. As Hathaway prepares to eliminate Olham, he escapes to the surface, where he teams up with the exiled citizens who live there. Together they try to prove Olham's innocence, while avoiding being captured by Hathaway. Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Hathaway, and much like his role in Law & Order: Criminal Intent his intensity and determination are infectious. He's paired with Gary Sinise, an actor I'm always disappointed to see in a leading role, and whom always manages to surprise me with a great performance. He isn't what I'd call an action star, and may not have been ideal for the role of Olham, but he was very believable. Impostor was only one of Dick's short stories, but it is every bit as good as his better known works, which of course include; Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report. If you want to see a unique story that blends Science Fiction, Drama, and Action, look no further than Impostor."" ]"

It's long, and at times, not easy to sit through, but if you're a fan of Stephen King, you should be used to that. This is vintage King and it's done right! When people don't like the movie, right away they go after the writer. They don't realize that a lot of times things are drastically changed to make them more visually appealing. In a horror flick, that's usually means  and/or gore, which are out of place in a King story. 1408 has none of that, it's just a good old fashion horror story about a room that possesses it's residence. The acting isn't going to blow you away, there aren't very many surprises as far as the story goes, but it's a scary story, done the way the master of horror intended and I liked it!"" ]"
clockstoppers;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Clockstoppers seemed like a Back To The Future rip off to me, but I'd wanted to see the it because I am a Sci-Fi geek and it was directed by Star Trek's Jonathan Frakes. My expectations weren't very high and the story, based in Science Fiction, had the potentially of being too hard for audiences to understand. The writers decided to go another way with it and put this unique, experimental technology in the accidental hands of a teenager, and then marketed the whole package to young adults. It sounded a bit sketchy to me too and that's why it took me almost ten years to see it, but what I learned from this film, you can never judge a DVD by it's cover. Clockstoppers combines Einstein's Theory of Relativity with teenage rebellion in an action packed film that will really leave you on the edge of your seat. The story starts when a former student of Prof. George Gibbs sends him a prototype, of a watch, that speeds up your molecules to the point where it looks like everything else is standing still. Prof. Gibbs soon leaves to go on vacation when his son finds the watch and wears it out, thinking it's a normal watch. Once he learns the truth, other Clockstoppers show up to try and kill him, and that's when the film really gets going. The acting and special effects aren't really what draws you into Clockstoppers, it's the story, which throws you in every single direction and leaves you craving more. This was a film that was at the bottom of my list, that I watched because it was short and it was streaming. I was just looking for something to watch before bed, and what I found instead was a terrific Science Fiction adventure that fell way under the radar."" ]"

That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series. Harry Potter is a huge budget franchise, but for once, a blockbuster film does live up to the hype, and earns the title of a must see movie!"" ]"
brigham-city;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""For the past decade, I've heard great things about Brigham City, but I've been very hesitant to see it. Aside from having a mostly unknown cast, the film was written, directed, produced, and starred Richard Dutcher, who created a production company called Mormon Cinema, which only makes Mormon related films. I have found that when a film comes from such a strong religious backing, that it usual has a preachy agenda, and tends to focus more on religion than anything else, but to my surprise, Brigham City does not. The film does takes place in a Mormon community, all the characters are Moron, and there is a religious angel to the film, that includes several scenes in the church, which were slow, but thankfully not overwhelming. The story centers around this small religious community in Utah, that is suddenly rocked by a series of murders. Dutcher, plays the sheriff, a highly respect, deeply religious man, grieving for the loss of his family. His town has always been a paradise and has never faced anything like this before, so the sheriff needs to come up with some pretty interesting ways to catch the killer. Dutcher was excellent in his role, after all he wrote it, and who else is better equipped to play such a role? What I really liked was how different the story was, this wasn't just your typical manhunt for a killer on the loose, there were many different facets to this film that made it unique. What gave Brigham City it's fourth star was the amazing twist at the end that no one will see coming. I've seen a lot of films like this and 9 times out of 10, I have the killer pegged before they are revealed, but this film completely blindsided me, which proves to be just another example of how clever it is. Yes, there is some religion and yes much of the cast is unknown, but I found this film to be fascinating. Brigham City had me captivated and on the edge of my seat, but most important of all it made me think and managed to really surprise me."" ]"

As for the cast, John Travolta and Vince Vaughn alone should tell you that you're in for something special. I know a lot of people love Vaughn, I don't, but he was great in this film. Matthew O'Leary, a newcomer back then, seemed as thou he's been doing this for years, acting as the perfect go between and playing his role flawlessly. Domestic Disturbance is fun, exciting, and has an unbelievable cast. Besides the predictability, the only other thing I can say negatively about this film was that it wasn't long enough!

Instead of going on some insane journey to find an unaffected area, he stays right in the heart of the crisis and tries to fix it. He is a great example of a true hero and Will Smith portrays it perfectly.

I don't get offended easily, but lines like \""Senator Chocolate Face\"" and \""the Jews repeating their attack of 9/11\"" were more than slightly over the line. While the line is much further away in the uncensored market, it does still exist, and Cohen does cross it on several occasions.

Tea Leoni's was by far the most interesting, as an up and coming reporter from a troubled family, who becomes the face of the crisis. What I didn't like was the storyline in space, where the would be heroes try to stop the asteroid. It just seemed unnecessary and like it dragged on. If the legendary Robert Duvall wasn't one of the astronauts, I'm pretty sure most of those scenes would have been cut.

In most things I've seen her in, I didn't like her, but here her performance actually rivals Jones's. This film is extremely well written and very methodical.

I found this to be a very strange film, as it features both moments of high intensity and moments that are painfully slow. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, the best safe cracker you could find, but as he's getting older and seeking more stability in his life. Considering retirement, Wells is asked to be part of one last big score, that will have him, and his fence, set for life. Wells reluctantly agrees, before finding out there is a catch, he'll be working with his possible replacement, an arrogant and cocky young man, who could wind up getting them all caught. As far as acting goes, you may never see a better trio of leading men, De Niro, Marlon Brando, and especially Edward Norton were absolutely terrific in their roles. The film however doesn't really take off until the crime actually begins. For over an hour they are in the planning stage, painstakingly going over every detail, and it really is as bad as it sounds, in fact, I almost turned it off, until the wheels were set in motion. From that point, the film really is terrific, with an ending that will leave your jaw on the floor! I was very happy with the last forty minutes of the film, and all three actors were fantastic, but so much of this film moves at a snails pact that I really couldn't give it a higher rating. This is a two hour film, that could have easily been shortened to an hour and a half, without losing any of it's integrity. All the detailed plans and unnecessary back and fourth make the first hour of this film painful, but if you can stick with it, the second hour is certainly worth it."" ]"

After 25 years and with talks of a second sequel on the way, I finally decided to see what Bill & Ted were all about. I was always scared off by the PG rating, I mean George Carlin in a PG rated film, come on! The first part of the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, as the two failing history dudes, fly around the world looking for historical figures. Things turn from ordinary to extraordinary when the group finally returns to 1989 and decide to go the mall of all places. This is where the film really finds itself and becomes more than just your typical buddy story. The interactions with people and the reactions on both sides are absolutely priceless and is what changed my opinion of this film. Keanu Reeves stars in one of his earliest roles, and manages to show that at some point in his life, he did have a personality and could tell a joke. His partner Alex Winter didn't really do much before or since, and while he wasn't great, he did have chemistry with Reeves, which always helps a movie progress. Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure wasn't so excellent, but it was different and manages to hold your attention.

reservoir-dogs;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Reservoir Dogs is the debut film from legendary Director, Quinton Tarantino, and that's why it's taken me such a long time to see it. Most Directors, even the great ones, aren't always successful right out of the gate. In fact, it's a very rare thing to accomplish, but I should have known that if anyone could do it, Tarantino could. In his signature style, Tarantino heavily uses flashbacks to piece together an amazing story of a heist gone bad. The score of a lifetime is at Joe Cabot's fingertips, so he puts together a crew of six of the best criminals his city has to offer. To make sure nothing goes wrong, everyone remains anonymous and is given a nicknames. Right from the start of the film, we know that something has gone terribly wrong, but what happened? That we'll eventually find out in pieces, through flashbacks, in a style that is pure Tarantino. Even in his first film, you can see the style, classic lines, and intriguing that made Tarantino the household name that he is. Aside from flashbacks, the other thing Tarantino is known for, is putting together unlikely casts, that turn out to be perfect for the roles they are in. Harvey Kaitel as Mr. White, may very well be the best of the lot. Kaitel is at the top of his game, and while older and unlikely to be the leader of the group, he turns out to be much more, including the star of this film. Reservoir Dogs is nearly twenty-five years old and it is still as exciting and relevant today as it was then. I never thought anything would ever come close to topping Pulp Fiction as my favorite Tarantino film, but Reservoir Dogs certainly makes a compelling argument for the top spot on that list."" ]"
american-gangster;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I'm not particularly fond of Russell Crowe, but when he came together with Ridley Scott, some terrific movies got made. Throw Denzel Washington into the mix and you have the makings of an epic drama. American Gangster was beloved by critics and the academy alike, but it also received negative reviews from the people the story was based on, who claimed it was ninety percent fiction. The film takes almost 3 hours to tell us the story of Frank Lucas, a man who was mentored by the great Bumpy Johnson, and ran Harlem, along with much of the heroin on the east coast from 1969 to 1977. In passed years, even prior to this film, Frank Lucas has been immortalized as some kind of hero. Many believe that he kept the people of Harlem out of poverty and ultimately did the right thing, once his conscience caught up with him. The film American Gangster seems to agree with this take on the story and portray Lucas as a man larger than life, who you want to like, despite his criminal activity. The truth is that Lucas was no hero, as for a decade he ran a crew as large as any organized crime family, and he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who overdosed on his junk. When Lucas turned states evidence, leading to the arrest of 150 people, most of whom were corrupt officials in New York City, it had nothing to do with his conscience, he just wanted to stay out of jail. That's not how it portrayed and was the only thing that really kept this film from getting a five star rating. American Gangster is shot much in the same style as Heat, with a large cast and fasting moving scenes. Denzel Washington is always good, but when he's playing someone from his own community he really steps it up to a whole other level. Washington absolutely should have received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Lucas. Regardless of how true the story may have been, Washington was just amazing. Denzel is paired with Russell Crowe, who portrays the man who is chasing him, a very deep and interesting man that seemed to fit Crowe's personality to a tee. American Gangster is a long, fast moving story, that may not be all that accurate, but you will be hard pressed to find a better cast then the one they had and for that, American Gangster is labeled as a must see movie."" ]"
along-came-a-spider;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Long before Tyler Perry turned Alex Cross into an action star, the all-star detective was portrayed correctly by the legendary Morgan Freeman. While the first film, Kiss The Girls, was a huge success, it's sequel, Along Came A Spider was a bust, once again due to the fact that the strengths of the character were not utilized properly. The character of Alex Cross was created by Author, James Patterson, and has been responsible for over 20 best selling novels, because he's unlike any other cop in any other mystery series. Cross is a psychologist first, who gets inside the heads of killers. Once he knows what they're thinking and why they're acting the way they are, Cross is usually able to capture them. These stories make for terrific novels, but when transferred to the screen, producers felt that they lack the action movie goers crave. Despite a successful first appearance on screen, the producers felt that with more action and bullets, the sequel would do even better, they were wrong. When a Senator's daughter is abducted from an upscale private school, detectives are at a loss, but call Cross in when evidence and a ransom demand turn up at his house. Cross believes the criminal is using his admiration to cover up the real motives for this crime, and he needs to play into that role, in order to determine what those motives are. This was a terrific novel, but wasn't right for the screen, so much of the story was cut and replaced by the manhunt and police chases. These elements make for a more intense film, but don't do justice to the story. Alex Cross and his abilities are the story and are what make the series unique. Morgan Freeman returned hesitantly to do the sequel and he was right when he said he shouldn't have done it, mainly because it takes away from the brilliance of the first film. The producers of this movie even managed to screw up a terrific surprise ending and that really says it all. Along Came A Spider is not a bad film, it certainly has it's movements and a legendary star, but if you're a fan of the Alex Cross novels, expect to be disappointed."" ]"
blow;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed."" ]"

This film is based on phenomena of anesthetic awareness, something we saw for the first time, 15 years earlier in a Tales From The Crypt episode. It was a great episode and seemed like it should make a good movie, but this wasn't it. Awake moves very slowly and is pretty boring for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that it just jumps around. Hayden yelling at people who can't hear him, gets old, quickly, but it continues to go on and on and on.

A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice."" ]"

The rest of the cast was equally as good, but the story was a bit odd. Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that doesn't really fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character and it had nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs. Overall I liked the movie and it had some great parts to it, especially the end, but my feeling is that something just wasn't right about it."" ]"

It's really interesting to see how 3 people, who are all in the same boat, wind up on such different paths, simply as a result of who they choose to spend their time with.

In my opinion, the movie is nowhere near as raunchy as it has to be. Movies like this are based on cheap laughs, and when it's PG-13 without a single boob or F bomb, it's just nothing special. By the end the film, it was just totally out of control. I should have just turned it off, but I suffered through to the end. Basically this movie was the foundation for Harold  Kumar.

The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was amazing as usual, but his character was kind of bland. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a super hero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of dull.

hoodlum;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""People who have seen American Gangster or are regular viewers of the TV show, Mobsters, will know who Bumpy Johnson was and know the story behind Hoodlum. For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told."" ]"

reservation-road;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Some stories can be extremely compelling and make for truly heart-wrenching drama, but no matter how real the story is or how much we feel for the characters, there are only so many angles and so many ways to tell a story. After a school residual, The Learner family stops to get gas and their 10 year old son goes to release fireflies by the side of the road. At the same time, a man returning from the Red Sox game is more interested in his cell phone than the road, and runs the young boy over. From there on the movie is as you would expect it to be. One side is devastated while the other is in cover up mode. The police investigation, vigilantism, bereavement, and the justice system get involved in what turns out to be little more than a lifetime movie of the week. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the grieving father out seeking revenge, in the kind of performance that really makes you feel for the guy, but aside from that, Reservation Road is just a very predictable film that is out for one thing, your tears. It's a sad story told from every possible angle, covering every possible thing that could happen in a situation like this, and it's definitely preaching about the dangers of distracted driving. If not for the huge cast, this could have easily been a lifetime movie, as the writing was that predictable and amateurish. The bottom line on Reservation Road is that it's a preachy, predictable, tear-jerker, without much substance, probably not worth your time unless you like that kind of thing."" ]"

This film has got to be one of the slowest moving \""thrillers\"" I've ever seen.

A friend of mine asked how I can consider myself a movie reviewer, when I haven't even seen the film that is widely considered to be the best of all-time. He had a point, so I decided to rent it and my verdict is it. While the Godfather is a tremendous epic drama, I really don't see how it is considered to be the best film ever made. It's a great story, with a superstar cast, which set the genre for all the mafia films that followed, but that in and of itself means the film is going to have problems. As with other mafia films, it's difficult to keep track of who's who in the large cast. It also moves rather quickly and viewers like myself are going to have a very difficult time of trying to follow the erratic timeline of the film. Some parts move at a snails pace, while other just fly by, and what is with the music? The soundtrack is almost as acclaimed as the film, but honestly if I had to hear that song one more time, during this three hour epic, I may have gone out and killed someone myself. For those unfamiliar with the story, it follows the evolution of the Corleone family, as they transition from one leader to the next. The story is fantastic and is the furthest thing from predictable that you will ever find. It is filed with classic scenes and renowned performance from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but I really have a hard time calling such a complicated story with that much violence, the best of all-time. The Godfather is a terrific movie, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it, but in a word, the film is overrated."" ]"

Charlie Wilson is portrayed as a sex addicted man whore, who follows his dick more than his brain. As for the film, it was just so confusing to me, they jump from scene to scene so quickly and introduce a ton of characters so fast, that by the time they got to Julia Roberts, I was already sick of the film. I didn't even get through the whole thing to be completely honest with you. It's an unbelievable cast and a pretty cool story, but I was not happy with the way the movie was done.

the-rock;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Yes, there was a time when Michael Bay made movies that actually had a plot to go with the explosions, and some, like The Rock, were terrific. I had never seen The Rock from beginning to end, having just caught glimpses of it on TV, but watching it in it's entirety proved what I'd long suspected, it was a great film. A Marine General, upset that his lost soldiers never received the compensation they deserved for their secret missions, takes control of Alcatraz island, and aims chemical weapons at San Francisco. The FBI is at a lost as to what to do and decide to go with an unconventional idea to try and stop the general. A team of Navy seals prepare to take the island back, lead by the only man to ever escape from Alcatraz, now in his sixties, and a chemical weapons specialist who has never been in combat. Sean Connery stars and even though he was nearing the end of his illustrious career, he gives a truly great performance, that reminds us of just how great his movies were. Connery was the premiere action star, in a time before special effects had been computerized. He really gives an old school attitude and feeling to the film, which helps The Rock stand out from it's competition. Connery is paired with Nicholas Cage who is always terrific, especially when he's playing some type of law enforcer. Cage adds humor, unintentionally, with his inexperience, and winds up doing some pretty amazing things. While I don't like to mention specific scenes in a film, I'd be remiss not to mention the incredible chase scene Cage has through the streets of San Francisco, in the beginning of the film. It was reminiscent of the great car chases of the Lethal Weapon series, and really stood out to me. The Rock is a terrific story, featuring a cast in which old school and the younger generation collide, and to top it all off, it has that Michael Bay spin and over reliance on special effects. It's a terrific action film which sadly is rarely seen anymore in the world of computer generated effects and muscle headed action stars."" ]"
jumper;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""Jumper is the first film from a trilogy of books by Steven Gould, and while I loved this film, most critics panned it. The story centers around a young Davey (Hayden Christensen), who during a life-threatening event, come to realize he has the power to teleport wherever he wants. Unbeknownst to Davey, he is a member of a group of genetically superior humans known as Jumpers, who are currently at war with a religious organization, that believes their power is evil. What starts out as a simple kid having fun and trying to impress, becomes a fight for survival in this amazing action thriller. You can always tell when a story is adapted from a book, rather than an original screenplay, because the story tends to be more thought out. Not to say screenplays are bad, but when a story isn't made simply to be a movie, it tends to be much more focused on the story, where as screenplays have to worry about the story as well as the aesthetics. Nevertheless, Jumper isn't just another shoot 'em story, it's the perfect mix of action and drama with some outstanding performances. I love Hayden Christensen, who I think is made for roles like this, he has this cool demeanor to him, that's more clever than arrogant. Jamie Bell is also terrific as Griffin, a fellow jumper Davey meets along the way,  and he provides some much needed comic relief. ...and then there's Samuel L. Jackson. What is there to say about Jackson that hasn't already been said? The man is a legend. This film is interesting, unique, fast-paced, and even funny. I loved every minute of Jumper and if Sci-Fi is your thing, you will too!"" ]"
thelma-louise;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Nearly twenty-five years after it's release, Thelma & Louise is still heralded as a classic, and is on most critics best films list. For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes. Thelma & Louise have their moments on their little adventure, but in the end, it's familiar, predictable, and forgettable."" ]"

You see that even if you can figure out how to survive, you still witness untold horrors. Edward Furlong is very underrated and great as always.

The whole background story of love, looking for love, and flirting was very cheesy. The relationship between Diane Lane  Mark Wahlberg was necessary, the rest was not, such as hearing his thoughts before he's about to drown in the ocean... come on! I also didn't like the supposition as to what happened on the ship during their finally voyage. Did Sully and Murph really fight? The rogue wave? The shark?

The story line was much closer to what I expected to see from this franchise, and this time, John Woo was Directing. I generally don't care for his writing, but when it comes to Directing action films, he's one of the best. In the second installment of Mission: Impossible, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is after a former agent, but not quite sure about what he's planning to do. As he follows the trail, Ethan learns the man has developed a deadly virus, and Ethan's mission, should he choose to accept it, is to save the day. Tom Cruise is his usual self and the action sequences are textbook John Woo, so why is this rated 3 1/2 stars you may ask?

The story is about fighting discrimination, something many of us can easily relate to...and while the special effects are way over the top, they are most defiantly unique.

Roberts says between the pain and the constant moving around he could never have done it without drugs!

As for the film, it's not much better. I love Edward Norton, he's a big name and a star in his own right, but he's just about the last person I would choose to be the Hulk. His whole personality wasn't right for the part. I like his co-star, Liv Tyler too, and it wasn't that she was bad in this film, it's that her role was a joke and she had absolutely no chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth was the bright spot in the movie, as he's one of those guys who can adapt to any role and I think I'd have preferred to see him as the Hulk. As for the story, parts of it were decent, but they skipped the whole part of the story that I wanted to see! The film starts five years later, in Brazil, I wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this. I hate superheroes and I hate their movies, but the Avengers stories have been different. With the exception of Thor, they have for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable.

The story follows a younger lawyer who is graduating at the top of his Harvard Law class. As the offers pour in, he has a tough decision to make, and finally settles on a small Nashville firm, that has made him an offer that is too good to be true. As he starts working for The Firm, Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) comes to realize that their only client is an organized crime syndicate and he's trapped inside. Eventually, the FBI comes to McDeere and tries to recruit him as a whistle blower, and his response is somewhat unorthodox. What I never understood about this story is why McDeere went to the lengths he did. He could have achieved the same outcome by simply complying with one side or the other. He jumps through all these hoops and does all these secretive things in order to achieve the same outcome. To me, this always made the second half of the book and film to be pretty much pointless. Tom Cruise stars and shines in the type of role that defined his early career. At this point in his career, if Tom Cruise is not starring as a dark loner or a sci-fi action hero, there isn't any point to watching his movies, but back in the early 90s he really had that special spark that has garnered him the reputation he has today. Cruise was paired with Gene Hackman, making the perfect dynamic of the old star, turning things over to the new. It was a bold move that didn't work out so well for the Indiana Jones franchise, but here it was one of the most interesting things about this film. The acting is terrific and a Grisham film is always very clever and well written, but as I said I've never been a fan of The Firm.

The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things. The performances in this film were Oscar worthy, building on the success of their last collaboration, The Shawshank Redemption, King and Durabont, got the biggest star in Hollywood to star in this film. The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be. The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor. That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find. Like many classic films the critics love, it's a bit long, parts of it are somewhat boring, and the storyline isn't for everybody, there are plenty of people who just won't get it. I did get it and I feel the better for it. This is one of those films, love it or hate it, that everyone should see at least once."" ]"

An aging pitcher, at the end of his career, looks back on how it all started, while in the middle of pitching what could be his final game. Along with the flashbacks of his baseball memories, come flashbacks of his romance, which are long and lame. The baseball part of it is what attracted me and is great. If this was strictly a sports movie, it would be 5 stars. The story of his career is much stronger than several other films dedicated to just the game. With this film you have to take the good with the bad. At times it seems like two entirely different movies and it really takes away from what is otherwise a great film."" ]"

So, when Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd), discovers that the husband she's been convicted of killing is actually still alive, she goes on a mission to hunt him down. There is one problem though, her parole officer is determined to stop her. This is one of those films that for some reason you easily forget about. I saw Double Jeopardy when it was in the theaters and totally forgot about it, until it was on TV last week. It's only then that I remembered just how intense it is. Ashley Judd is truly a fantastic actress when she's in the right role, and trust me, a scored, lonely woman is the perfect role for her. Tommy Lee Jones has a somewhat smaller part than we are used too, but he's as amazing as he's always been. The chase for Libby easily brings back memories of Marshall Samuel Gerard. The only knock against this film is that it is unfortunately somewhat predictable, if you're looking for a shocking twist in the story, you won't find it here. The extreme nature of the story and the terrific acting more than make up for the predictability though and the film is perfect for those times where you just want to be entertained without having to think too much."" ]"

Bruce Willis is easily one of my favorite actors and having seen almost everything he's done, I rented this. What can I say? It's the story about meeting your soul mate, getting married, and the ups  downs associated with family life. There are no surprises and there is nothing special here. I didn't find the movie particularly funny and even at 96 minutes, it still felt very long. If you're into these sappy romantic comedies, you might like it, you might not.

Seldom is an action movie really focused on the story, instead it's always about the man who can do the impossible. In Too Deep was different though because it was based on a true story and there really weren't any expensive special effects. In this film, Omar Epps plays a rookie, undercover cop, whose first small assignment actually leads him into the number one crime syndicate in all of Cincinnati. The inexperienced cop uses his urban upbringing and street smarts to get him to the top, where he really has to decide which side he wants to be on. In Too Deep featured a great, real life story, that was on the level, I really enjoyed this film. On top of that Epps and LL Cool J were terrific opposing each other and giving strong performances. What I didn't care for was the blatant racism from Director Michael Rymer. Everything was very well done, but it is very obvious that the Writer/Director of this film was white, while the majority of the cast was black. What I witnessed was a film where all the people in charge were white, all the thugs were black, but it didn't end there. The white people spoke eloquently, while even the black officers and other non-affiliated cast members all spoke street. Every person from the rookie cops aging father to the man who ran the convenience store were dropping F bombs left and right, adding man to every other word, and constantly saying the N word. I understand the point of this movie was to be real, but part of that realism was that this gang had never been infiltrated because of how smart they were. Instead of being portrayed as smooth and savvy, the leaders of the gang were portrayed as ignorant thugs and that really takes away from the film."" ]"

Paranormal Activity, The Grudge, The Ring, are you kidding me?! Those movies were terrible! They don't make movies like Stir of Echoes anymore, this is a supernatural thriller, that was truly unsettling and creepy, the kind of film that defines what supernatural horror should be. Tom & Maggie are celebrating moving into a new house, and as the party is winding down, Maggie's sister claims to know something about the supernatural. Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a complete skeptic, so she offers to hypnotize him and see what happens. Reluctantly Tom agrees and after seeing some strange flashes, Tom wakes up unsettled but still a non-believer. Over the next few weeks, Tom continues to see strange images of a girl asking for his help and believes his sister in-law messed with his mind somehow. Once convinced that she had nothing to do with it, Tom decides to investigate and try to find out, who this girl is and why she's asking for help. This movie is truly scary because depending on what you believe in, this could be 100% real. Kevin Bacon is one of those actors who when he is in the right role is better than anyone, and this role is perfect for him. Bacon had me on the edge of my seat and it seemed as thou this movie just flew by. I wanted to know who this girl was and what happened to her just as much as he did. As for the paranormal stuff, it wasn't bloody, gory, and out of nowhere but it was just as creepy. This is the kind of film that left you jittery and uneasy for hours afterwards, the definitive horror movie. Bad reviews had me skeptical, but I am a skeptic no longer, Stir of Echoes will most definitely be included in my next Halloween movie marathon!"" ]"

Don't get me wrong, this one certainly had it's funny moments, but in my estimation it wasn't as good as the second one. Jason Biggs  Alyson Hannigan are hilarious, but for all they bring to the table, bad actors like Eddie Kay Thomas and Chris Klein take away, making the good performances moot. American Pie is a classic teen comedy about sex and it ushered in a new era in comedy that's still relevant today. It has the raunchy, crazy, good looking youth we see in today's comedy, but unfortunately also has some really lame jokes and bad acting, that thankful went out with the nineties."" ]"

This movie was a first for many TV stars on the big screen like Katie Holmes, Scott Wolf, and Jay Mohr, but it's the newcomers like Sarah Polley and Desmond Askew that make this film work.

Adams believes that patients need to be treated not just for their physical ailments, but also for their emotional well being. He also believes that like freedom of speech, healthcare is an inalienable human right that should be provided to everyone. This is a film that was written specifically for and with the help of Robin Williams. While Adams himself admitted that much of it was inaccurate, the film fulfills it's message, by using an extreme mix of emotion and humor. While watching this film you'll go between tears of laughter and tears of sadness, in a film that will really hit home with a lot of people. This is what Robin Williams was known for, he told his stories and got his messages out, while at the same time entertaining and inspiring people to be the best that they could be. If any other actor had played Patch, it probably would have been a slow moving drama, that just made everyone sad, but Williams made the story one that made you think and it sticks with you. As it recent weeks it has come to light that Williams himself was sick, and this may be the reason he took his own life, I can't help but wonder if on that night, had he watched this film, would the outcome have been different?"" ]"
varsity-blues;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""A movie about a high school football team, created by MTV, starring all the teen-heartthrobs of the late 90s, I couldn't have been more uninterested. For 17 years, I avoided seeing this film, I figured it would be a steaming pile full of good looking people with their shirts off, but after catching the ending on TV, I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. In Texas, football is everything, even at the high school level. The West Canaan Coyotes are one of the best teams in the state, thanks to a hard nosed, old school coach, and an NFL bound Quarterback, but their perfect season takes a turn when the Quarterback goes down with a serious knee injury. The Coyotes are left in the hands of John Moxon (James Van Der Beek), a kid who hasn't taken a snap in three years, who is only on the team because of his father. The coach hates him, the town doubts him, but something amazing happens when Mox is on the field, he's actually good. James Van Der Beek stars and honestly, I always felt that he was too much into the whole teen-heartthrob persona, I never took him seriously as an actor, or envisioned him being good in a role like this. Just as the town was surprised by how good Mox was on the field, I was just as surprised by how good Van Der Beek was in this role. When you add Jon Voight to the equation, as the hard nosed coach, things really come together. The two men hate each other, but are forced to work together, it's this dynamic and tension behind the scenes that really makes the off the field action as interesting as what's taking place on the field. Varsity Blues is produced by MTV, stars actors I normally wouldn't watch, and as it turns out it is one of the most exciting and intense sports films I've ever seen. One of the things I love about films, is that you can never judge them based on anything else other than their content. On the surface, this is something I'd never watch, but happenstance brought me to it, and it's honestly one of the best football movies I've ever seen."" ]"

This week I decided to watch Die Hard 2 for the 8 millionth time, because unlike most sequels, I found it to be better than the first. Not to say that the first isn't a classic film, but the second one has two things the first lacked. First, Director, Renny Harlan, who is the master of action films, completely unappreciated, and a man who has given me hours of excitement. The second thing is the supporting cast, which features the likes of Dennis Franz from NYPD Blue, Fred Thompson of Law n' Order, and of course veteran character actor, William Sadler. Willis once again is brilliant as John McClain and gave the 90's a true action hero! The Die Hard films are the frame work by which all modern action films are compared and if you skipped the second one, because it was a sequel, you're an idiot! This is a can't miss movie for action junkies."" ]"

A lot of other people who reviewed this movie didn't like it, because it moves slowly and then shows a lot of flashbacks of the crime through many different witnesses eyes, similar to the TV show Cold Case. Personally, I think this just adds to the suspense and helps build to an expected climax, which had unexpected results for everyone involved. Nicholas Cage plays Rick Santoro perfectly, its a role that at the time seemed as thou it could be a bit of a stretch for him, but as always he is terrific. This film is defiantly a throwback, that many people didn't seem to go for, but I think it's something different and well worth seeing."" ]"

During dinner, Kevin starts a fight with his older brother, Buzz, and is sent to sleep alone in the attic. An overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and Kevin gets left home alone. At the same time, a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house. Kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it. As his parents rush to get back to him, Kevin prepares for war! Home Alone is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be. These films all claim to be fun for the whole family, but lets face it, they're geared toward children. Most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in you're on your phone or falling asleep, but not here. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Macaulay Culkin is fantastic. We all know Pesci for his mobster roles, so it's easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor, and it is actually what he does best. Paired with a great cast, a legendary director, and a terrific story, this is simply the best family feature film I have ever seen. Home Alone has something for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry, and beg for more, and that's why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film, but as I said earlier there will only ever be one Home Alone and it is an absolute must see movie!"" ]"
the-matrix;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""It's been over 10 years since I've seen the Matrix, and to be completely honest with you, back then, I didn't really get it the way I did this time. When the film was made it was a huge risk for the production company, as it was extremely expensive, and featured a first a time Director, using a new kind of computerized effects. 15 years later and the film is considered to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made. For those unfamiliar with the story, it takes place 200 years in the future, a time where machines have taken control of the planet and 99% of humans live in blissful ignorance, as pawns in stasis, living out there lives in a dreamworld called the Matrix. The other 1% know the truth and will do whatever it takes to defeat the machines. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leads the charge, following an ancient prophecy, that says they will one day discover a human with extraordinary abilities, that will lead to the destruction of the Matrix. That man is named Neo and is played by Keanu Reeves, in what many consider to be his crowning achievement. Reeves is often put down for being too dark and emotionless in his roles, but that is exactly what the role of Neo calls for, making Reeves the perfect choice to play him. Reeves is paired with veteran actor Laurence Fishburne, who as Morpheus, is like the pope of this new world. He is the one who discovered the prophecy and who risks everything for Neo. The story of the Matrix is one of the most original to come alone in decades, featuring a perfectly cast group of actors, who are aided by special effects, the likes of which had never been seen before. These effects are common place in 2014, but were unheard of in 1999, and really helped cement the reputation of this classic. The Matrix may not be the perfect movie and in fact, a lot of people won't understand it, but it's a film that people will be watching 200 years from now, when the events of the film supposedly take place."" ]"

The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter. Primal Fear is a perfect example of what it takes to create a great movie, and after you watch it, let me know if you can figure out where the title comes from.

In general, I find these huge franchise films to be fun, some are better than others, but that's usually based on the writing and the cast. In watching the first of the Mission: Impossible films, my expectations were very high, and while Tom Cruise didn't disappoint, Brian De Palma certainly did. The king of mystery could have developed a better story than this. The action sequences were impressive and the special effects were way over the top, but I still felt the story could have been developed a lot more. Maybe being the first film in an eventual franchise, producers wanted to give the series as much action and explosions as possible. If that was the case, they should have called Michael Bay, this film has all the makings of one of his films, not a De Palma film. That being said, the bottom line is that first mission is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Student replacing teacher, in a film that's one chase and fire fight after another.

Robin Williams stars as Professor John Keating, an unconventional teacher who inspired his students to push the boundaries of the way they think. Keating's students worship him and reform the old club he was a founding member of as a student, The Dead Poets Society. Keating's unconventional thinking pushes his students, but the question is will it push some of them too far from the norm, at their strict boarding school? The performances makes this film, as you will see some amazing things. As for the story, it really isn't anything more than a means to present the characters. When you take away the performances, the truth is that this film is about a traditional boarding school, an English class, and a poetry club, not the most interesting of stories. Dead Poets Society is rather slow moving and one begins to question just how meaningful a club like this would be, especially in today's digital world. When it comes to Dead Poets Society, I loved the performances, but wasn't crazy about the film as a whole. I think the storyline is lacking, the characters aren't as unconventional as they could have been, and things move much too slowly for mainstream audiences. That being said, if you are a movie lover, this film is like It's A Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane in that it may not be the best of films, but it is a part of cinematic history that must be scene for it's undeniably outstanding performances and it's contribution to the history of film."" ]"
a-bronx-tale;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear."" ]"

This controversial film is about no matter how well we know each other, there is still racial tension living right under the surface. All it takes is some pointless argument about a picture on the wall or a radio being played too loudly, for racism to rear it's ugly head on both sides. Then what happens? People are dead, businesses are ruined, and communities are rioting. Over what? The argument is but a mere spark, racism is the issue. Had the argument been between two black men, instead of a white man and a black man, things would have turned out much differently. That's the point of this film, very wisely and overlooked, Spike Lee is saying who cares what color the person is, step up and do the right thing in every situation.

timecop;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""It's a rare occurrence, but once in a while, a film is made that is way ahead of it's time, too far ahead of it's time, and Timecop is one of those films. Had it been made in the error of CGI, this film would have been so much better. The story is strong, a lot stronger than the performances, and the use of some crazy special effects would have taken it over the top, but those weren't available in 1994. The result is a slightly above average film, with a really cool plot, and not much else. The story follows Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme) whose job is to stop people from using illegal time travel technology, in order to change the past. Changing the past can drastically change the present, and is often abused by criminals trying to get wealth and power. One of those men is U.S. Senator McComb (Ron Silver), who has his eye on the Presidency. Walker must go back in time to stop McComb and expose him, before he can reshape the country in his own image. I love time oriented Science Fiction, as the story can take you on a magical trip all throughout history, like nothing else can. In this film, they didn't travel as much as they should have, and the technology and effects behind time travel were so basic, that it's hard to buy that this could ever work. Jean-Claude Van Damme stars and we all know that I see him as one of these brawn over brains guys, that only get work because of their looks and their fancy movies. Van Damme wasn't bad, but this is a film that had real potential, and simply using an average star, contributes to the overall sentiment of the film. Timecop is a great story, and in my opinion is something that could really work if it is re-made properly. It's not because the film is bad, it's just not a good as it should have been. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, I definitely recommend it, but if it's not your favorite genre, you might want to skip this one."" ]"

There are hundreds of books and stories they could have chosen from, and I suspect most of them would have been better than the Crystal Skull. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad, but aliens, Elvis, sword fights on the back of a jeep, cannibalistic ants, and Shia swinging through the Amazon with a family of monkeys? That's not Indiana Jones. I realize they wanted to portray him in perhaps the final years of his career, but the story was not great.

Al Pacino is of course amazing, he's pretty much amazing in everything he does, but as far as the film goes, its centered on this masochistic **** who was never happy with what he had. Tony Montana, was never a hero or someone who was meant to be looked up to as one of the greatest characters of all time. As far as Mob films go, Scarface is so much easier to follow then most, as the timeline makes sense, and you're not introduced to new people every five minutes. While Al Pacino is terrific, the mumbled lines and enormous greed leave something to be desired. Not to mention that when you break things down, isn't the film really just business meeting, gunfight, personal life, repeat? After a while the film feels like it's going around in circles and really is kind of stale. People will always remember this film for it's epic finally, taglines, and the great Al Pacino, but as far as stories go, this one isn't something I would consider a classic or a can't miss film. Scarface has it's moments and has to be at the top of the list for action junkies, but beyond that, I found the story to be just your run of the mill mafia tale, focused on a guy, who was too greedy and too stupid to hold onto everything he worked so hard for."" ]"

The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven. The original Scream is one that should be on your must see list!"" ]"
sleepers;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close."" ]"
soul-men;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Soul Men was a film that was racked with problems right from the start. Originally the film kept getting pushed back because of a law suit by the R&B group, Sam  David, which claimed it to be a farce on their life story. The group also accused the producers of copyright infringement for using their style and the title of one of their songs, \""Soul Man\"". The law suit was finally settled and the movie was released in 2008. Then, days before the films release, two of it's stars, Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, died on back to back days, a tragedy that created a public relations nightmare. For those reasons, this film wasn't widely distributed or advertised, which is a shame because it was one terrific film. The story starts 30 years after a legendary R&B group, Marcus Hooks  The Real Deal, broke up. We see the remaining members, Samuel L. Jackson in trouble with the law, and Bernie Mac, living in a retirement community, when they learn about the sudden death of Hooks. Record executives, quick to capitalize on his death, organize a tribute show at the Apollo in New York, and invite the Real Deal to participate. This means that two men who hate each other and haven't performed in almost 30 years, need to get their act together in a hurry if they want the big pay day and a chance at a come back. The film is an absolute riot, with Mac as the old lonely man and Jackson as the bitter forgotten convict. Their chemistry was nothing short of amazing and the big surprise was that both men can actually sing and dance! Even though they must have said mother f'er about a thousand times, I found the film to be very clever, funny, and original. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching."" ]"

One night, after multiple officers are shot and killed, it becomes clear that there is a large corruption ring at work within the NYPD, and the brass turn to Ray to find out the truth, a truth that could lead him right back home. Edward Norton is truly a chameleon in that he can play absolutely any role and be believable. It doesn't matter if he's some computer geek or a tough as nails cop, he always does a great job and no matter what he's in, the film is always going to have an air of credibility for it. The rest of the cast, as well as the story are also pretty good, but this film isn't without it's problems. As with other films that have complex stories and large casts, the story moves so quickly and characters are introduced so fast, that it's difficult to keep track of what's going on and nearly impossible to remember who is who. The story is great and the main characters are well written, but there is so much going on, that it is very easy to get lost in all the side stories. The bottom line is that Pride and Glory would be better suited as a TV series than a movie, but then you wouldn't have the big named cast, and it probably wouldn't last four episodes. The actions scenes are great, the main characters are intense, and the story was terrific if not a bit more complicated than it needed to be."" ]"
blade-runner;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""Blade Runner is widely considered to be the best Science Fiction movie ever made. It is on almost every top 100 list, and that's why I am reviewing it. To tell you why it is one of the most overrated films of all time. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, and the author of Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite authors, but Blade Runner is far from his best work. I would go as far as saying that Blade Runner isn't even in his top ten, and if it wasn't for Ridley Scott, it wouldn't have been the first film adaptation of Dick's work. At the time, the special effects were innovative and exciting, but they fail to live up to today's standards. With that being said, all that's left over is a simple story that follows a futuristic police chase and a very cheesy, awkward, love story. In a futuristic Los Angeles, android technology has been perfected. These replicants are used for labor an odd jobs, but occasionally, they become aware and try to run for their freedom. That is when the blade runners are called in to eliminate them. The best Blade Runner around is Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man who doesn't love his job, but always gives one hundred and ten percent. After three replicants escape from the moon, Deckard is called in to track them down and this is the whole premise of the movie. There isn't much of a side story and the rare breaks in the action, rarely prove to be substantive. The film is just you're typical chase with some very weird elements. For example, why does Rutger Hauer take off all his cloths before he fights Harrison Ford, and for that matter, what the hell is he talking about the whole time? How about the talking toys, can you tell me they weren't just a bit creepy and out of character for the rest of the film? Finally, we're in Los Angeles, why is everything Chinese? The story is just a very strange chase through a futuristic nightmare scenario for Los Angeles. Yes, Harrison Ford was terrific, and yes, it must of been the hardest thing Ridley Scott ever had to direct, but the film and story itself are very simplistic and certainly not worthy of legendary status. I love Philip K. Dick and I am obsessed with Science Fiction, but watching Blade Runner for the third time, I was still just as bored and confused as I was the other two times I saw it. How can anything that makes a person feel that way be considered legendary?"" ]"

From its raunchy plot to it's great one liners, to it's awesome cameos, Zack  Miri is two hours of pure comic genius. Seth Rogan  Elizabeth Banks have amazing chemistry together, it seemed as thou they've been working together for years, despite only doing one other movie together. Jason Mewes and Craig Robinson are hilarious as always, and the plot is pure genius. A lot of movies like this get buried due to poor acting or too much stupid, on the contrary, Zack  Miri is an absolute classic!"" ]"

What Doesn't Kill You is the story of two brothers, who grow up in poverty and whom turned to organized crime to survive. For fifteen years, they did what they were told, but with the boss on his way to prison, they decide to go off on their own. Admittedly, it's a tremendous story that follows the paths of these brothers over  the course of the next few years, the problem was that in this movie, years translate into about 10 minute intervals. Instead of giving us a complete and accurate portrayal, the director decided to cut the story into small fragments, usually no longer than a minute or two. Something is said, something happens, and then were on to another something, when? where? who knows!? The movie moved so fast and was so choppy, that it left my head spinning. Despite the confusion, it was pretty entertaining and Mark Ruffalo gives an unbelievable performance. Here's another example of a guy I've seen around, never thought much of, who randomly shows up in a B-movie and just makes the whole film worth watching. If you're able to keep up, and this movie doesn't confuse you into an absolute stupor, it's not bad. The story is solid, the cast is good, and it has it's moments, but again only if you can get passed the ridiculous pace the director has decided to set for us."" ]"

The story however was extremely weak and filled with cliché Star Wars jokes. It was predictable, done, and  lame. The only really cool thing about the film was the cameos. In this tiny independent film they had cameos by William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Kevin Smith, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Seth Rogan, an impressive list to be sure! Like I said thou, the movie was weak and done. Unless you're a diehard Star Wars fan, I'd skip this one."" ]"
echelon-conspiracy;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""For the first 40 minutes, I was mesmerized by this film. The beginning was as thrilling and intriguing as any film I'd seen all year, but after that, the big secret is revealed and it became almost a shot for shot remake of Eagle Eye. It was seriously ridiculous how the two stories became almost exactly alike. Realizing this, the writers decided to throw in a big twist at the end, that might have saved the film had it made even a single bit of sense. Echelon Conspiracy begins with computer programer, Max Petersen (Shane West), anonymously receiving a brand new, state of the art, cell phone in the mail. The phone gives him instructions which lead to him winning a lot of money. Everything is going great for Max, until he disobeys the phones wishes and the FBI shows up. Shane West was fantastic in this film, it really makes me wonder why he doesn't do more stuff like this. West seems to prefer romantic dramas, but is clearly missing his true calling. After seeing a performance like this, I'd easily put him at the top of the list for any major action film. West was paired in this film with Edward Burns who was terrific and Ving Rhames who was Ving Rhames. I say that, because sometimes he's the perfect fit for a role and other times, he couldn't be more out of place, a perfect example of which is his role in this film. As I said, this movie starts out great, but becomes exactly like Eagle Eye, I would venture to say that the two films are so much a like that the producers of Eagle Eye have a case for copyright infringement, it really was that close. Besides that, the film was a decent action film, with some nice performances. Had I not seen Eagle Eye, I may have thought more of this film, but as it stands, Echelon Conspiracy is just another low budget rip off of a semi-decent major motion picture and not much else."" ]"

If the performance wasn't in the context of a messed up girl in a horror movie, she would have gotten academy notice, she was THAT good. Jimmy Bennett was also really good playing her adoptive brother, he even did his own stunts. Every time I see this kid he gets better and better, and I think you'll be seeing his name in films for the next fifty years. The parents don't really have a major role in the film, but they were equally as good.

When Da Vinci Code came out, I had just seen National Treasure, and there were so many similarities, that I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. Angels  Demons does what every sequel aspires to do. It takes the characters we like and puts them in a similar but different story. Tom Hanks is once again terrific, bringing an intensity that few others can match. Following the clues lost in time and the twists and turns thrown in by writer, Dan Brown, Angels  Demons is most defiantly a sequel that lives up to the first one and also gives you something to talk about.

the-hurt-locker;10;7;Tss5078;"[ ""I have never really enjoyed war films. I am by no means a pacifist, but to me all the stories seem to be the same, and until now, I've been uninterested. It wasn't until viewing the Academy's best picture of 2010, The Hurt Locker, that I started to see things differently. In these films, it's not so much the story line that matters, but rather the characters that are featured in the film. The description of The Hurt Locker is just as bland as any other war picture, the story of a unit in Iraq that is responsible for disarming explosives. What makes this film so unique and made it the best film of 2010 was William James, played remarkably well by Jeremy Renner. Renner is known as an action star, so when I saw him nominated for best actor, I couldn't believe it. The truth is Renner's performance in this film was outstanding, because for once, he simply played himself. Renner may have been portraying a Sargent in Iraq, but the personality was his own. Director, Kathryn Bigelow, has become known for letting actors be themselves in developing their characters personalities, to the point where even some of the dialogue was in the spur of the moment. The Hurt Locker is a powerful film, with remarkable events and heartbreaking moments, but it's the films personality that is larger than life. I enjoyed every second of this film and it was truly the best choice the Academy could have made for best picture."" ]"

sorority-row;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""he daughters of Bruce Willis and Greg Evigan team up in Sorority Row, a remake of the 1983 Horror classic, The House on Sorority Row. The remake is of course modernized and takes the classic independent horror film to the next level, with terrific effects, increased levels of fright and gore, and of course a ton of beautiful people. Where is this college and how soon can I apply?! Every guy and girl featured in the film, with the exception of Carrie Fisher, could be models, despite being well passed the age of most college students. The story starts out much like the original film does, with a Sorority prank that goes horribly wrong. The girls decide to cover up the incident and put it behind them, but at a large cost to their sisterhood. A year later, at the same party, someone knows what happened last year, and have decided to make the whole Sorority pay for their crimes. This film is a classic 'who done it' mashed together with a slasher film, and the results are pure excitement. The truth is that most of these film don't have much in the way of a story line and the killer is obvious to everyone, but not this time. This film is very reminiscent of Scream, and it really had me on the edge of my seat. A good Horror film is hard enough to find, but one with all that suspense and a compelling story to follow, that's worth it's weight in gold! Sorority Row is a perfect choice for those who want to spend Halloween, in front of the TV watching a scary movie!"" ]"
public-enemies;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The producers of this film would like you to think it is a modern version of the Untouchables, but anyone who has seen this film will tell you it's far from it. It's not that Public Enemies was a bad movies, but a lot of people panned it because they expected a lot more from a 100 million dollar movie, starting Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, and they have a point. The story was flawed right from the beginning because the true story behind it really wasn't that interesting. The filmmakers tried to get people to watch it, by saying that Dillinger and Purvis were comparable to Capone and Ness, but that's not true. In reality, they had almost no interaction with each other and in the movie, whenever they were together, all they did was shoot at each other. There wasn't any chemistry between them, because their supposed rivalry was a fictions element added to an otherwise true story. The film should have focused on infamous bank robber, John Dillinger, but instead it focuses on the FBI hunt for him and his life on the run, long after the bulk of his crimes had been committed. Johnny Depp portrays Dillinger in an attempt to go back to being a legitimate actor instead of a Disney puppet, and he fails miserably. This guy can be one hell of actor, when the role fits his personality, but John Dillinger does not. Depp is an emotionless mess of mumbled lines that almost completely destroy the film. Thankfully, Christian Bale was much better and far more interesting. Public Enemies had big expectations, an all-star cast, and a huge budget, but it turned out to be an average film. That's what had people so upset, because had this been an independent film, they would have been okay with it. The fact that Public Enemies was billed as the next Untouchables, but fails to deliver even a single memorable scene just destroys any credibility the film had going for it."" ]"

For all you haters out there, the one thing you can't deny is Tarantino's unique ability to bring out the best in everyone he works with, and that is why many times, the cast members of his films earn Oscar nominations. Inglourious Basterds is another uniquely strange story that just works, because of Tarantino. As has become his signature, the story is broken up into seemingly unrelated stories that all come together in a terrific ending. The story centers around a group of Jewish-American soldiers in World War II, whose assignment was to go into France, undercover, and track down and slaughter Nazis. It's a terrific cast led by Brad Pitt, but to me he wasn't so much the star of this film, that honor belongs to Christopher Waltz, who in his first major role, did win the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a strong story and a great film, but something bothered me about it. Inglourious Basterds is of course a fictional story, so the attention to detail, such as having everyone speaking in their native languages, seemed someone unnecessary to me. That combined with subtitles that moved at the speed of light, made the story somewhat hard for me to follow. That's why I watched it a few times before reviewing it. There is no denying that this is one hell of a story with another tremendous cast, that deserved every award that it's won, however Tarantino's attention to detail, usually a strength, did take away from the film, as a whole, and did make some parts difficult to follow."" ]"

the-lovely-bones;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The Lovely Bones was an award winning novel, turned into a major motion picture in 2009. Peter Jackson signed on to Direct and Steven Spielberg was the Executive Producer, so the budget for this film was massive, but it didn't do so well, leading people to believe it was a bad movie. While it was different from what the readers expected, the film was still better than average. The story is told by Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14 year old girl, who was murdered. Susie introduces us to her family and to her killer in what I saw as a mix between Ghost and What Dreams May Come. The story is extremely strong and very well written, but it isn't without it's problems. For instance, we learn the identity of the murderer almost immediately. There are also huge gaps in the story between when we see Susie in purgatory and when we see her families again. Saorise Ronan plays Susie and continues to amaze me. I honestly haven't been that crazy about most of the films I've seen her in, but she never seizes to amaze me. It really is only a matter of time until she's in the right film and gets national attention. By then, not only will people know her name, but they'll know how to pronounce it too. She is supported by some big names like Stanley Tucci, who at this point in his career has convinced me that he can play just about any role. The Lovely Bones is a great story, but it wasn't done in a way that appeals to mass audiences. The scenes in purgatory were never ending and there are big holes in the story, but the cast is terrific and the story is really good.

The Conforte's were the first people to open a legalized brothel in the state of Nevada and for a while, became local celebrities, until it all came crashing down. It was an interesting story, following the lives of two people, that most of us don't know anything about. As for the film, while it over-dramatized a lot of the events, it really fails to make much of an impact. There are scenes that make these two look like gangsters, others that make them look like royalty, and several that just makes them look like trailer trash. The truth is that it was hard to really decipher the true character of these people and figure out what they were really like. I was mildly interested in the story, but what I really wanted to see was the return of Joe Pesci. Since retiring in 1999, Pesci had a cameo in one film, but this is was his first leading role since Lethal Weapon 4. For the living legend, it was as if he had never stopped, giving a terrific performance. The only disappointing thing was that they kept Pesci's classic, profanity laced tirades to a minimum, but other than that, he was really terrific. Helen Mirren on the other hands kind of annoyed me in this film. She's always been an amazing actress, but her performance was really all over the place. I guess it has to do with the emotional state of the woman she was playing, but to be honest I was very unimpressed by what I saw from her. While it was great to see Joe Pesci back on the big screen, the Love Ranch was really just a mass of confusion that was all over the place. It was nearly impossible to separate the truth from the Hollywood bull **** when personalities and situations are changing so rapidly. If you love Joe Pesci, you won't want to miss his comeback, but the film that brought him out of retirement, really isn't anything special."" ]"

Sadly though, even with all the film apparently had going for it, Charlie St. Cloud was a boring flop. The story follows a young man's journey to re-discover himself following a drunk driving accident that claimed the life of his little brother. It's a solid story to build on, but that's just it, it really doesn't go anywhere from there. Charlie is consumed by what happened and even years later spends hours in the woods talking to his brothers ghost.

A former model, Crawford has gained popularity as one of the leads in Gossip Girl and it has been said, on more than one occasion, that his looks are the reason, but he proves them all wrong with a gutsy and amazing performance in Twelve.

Unlike most Horror/Thriller writers, Shyamalan doesn't use gore to shock you, but rather has a story that will just scare you to your core, and by the end of this one I was rattled! This is a top notch film that fell way under the radar, because of its unknown cast, but if you like scary movies or edge of your seat thrillers, you have to see this film!"" ]"

This film is twisted, disgusting, and just  up. Two scientists decide they can splice human and animal DNA to create a genetically perfect being. This being would naturally produce cures to many diseases and could change the world. The whole time I was waiting for this thing to go crazy and kill everyone, but it doesn't quite happen that way. First, the scientists treat it like a pet, than a baby, than they  it... Oh no, I'm not joking! This film is disgusting! ...and how come everything these scientists make looks like a big penis?

conviction;9;6;Tss5078;"[ ""A lot of film are made that are based on a true story, and most of these films claim to be inspirational, but seldom are. Finding a truly inspirational film, that is based on a true story, is like finding a needle in a haystack, in this case, that needle is called Conviction. Betty Anne Waters (Hilary Swank) came from a dysfunctional family, dropped out of High School, got married, and had kids, while she was still a child herself. She never wanted to be anything more than a housewife, until her brother, Kenneth (Sam Rockwell), was convicted of a murder she knew he couldn't have committed. It took fifteen long years, but Betty Anne got her GED, finished college, and went to law school, with the hopes of one day getting her brother exonerated. Hilary Swank stars and thrives in roles like this one. Despite her beauty and talent, she is one of the most down to earth people in Hollywood, and is always very believable as a normal, every day person. In most of her films, she is the kind of person audiences empathize with and cheer for, making her perfect for this role. She is paired with Sam Rockwell who is one of the most underrated stars in Hollywood. The man has immense talent, but is seldom talked about, because of the awful films he decides to star in. I have admired Rockwell for a long time, but this is the first time I can remember rating a film he was in higher than three stars. Conviction is a real story, written by the people who lived through it. It is heartfelt, inspirational, and most importantly real. The film may have bombed in theaters, but it is a true gem that was seriously overlooked."" ]"
nowhere-boy;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Nowhere Boy is the critically acclaimed story of John Lennon's adolescence and the formation of the Beatles. The film was a culmination of several biographies of Lennon, along with firsthand accounts from friends and family. Aaron Johnson was utterly fantastic as Lennon, giving a very strong performance. People were genuinely surprised when he was cast, being that he's not British, but it's not an issue. As for the film, in all honesty, until Lennon meets McCartney, the film is kind of slow. After that, it picks up a little bit, but jumps around quite a bit and gets to be rather confusing. I'm convinced that I only enjoyed this film, because it's subject is someone I greatly admired and someone I wanted to know more about. The performances were top notch and I did learn a lot about John Lennon and the Beatles, but overall this film was a little dry."" ]"

Despite its original title and awful special effects, Monsters, is not a bad story. It is however another example of a writer, using science fiction, to promote his own agenda and bigotry. The infected zone is Mexico and you're safe once you get to America. How about the largest man made structure in the world? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA. As for the acting, it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good, but whom are easily overlooked. It's because Monsters is one of those movies, where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. It had good potential, but was just painfully boring...unless of course you enjoy octopus ****ing."" ]"

Metro-sexual Ethan didn't have the same shock value and loveable loser quality as Alan did, I didn't find him funny, I just felt sorry for him. The plot didn't help the film much either. How many times have you seen two strangers, thrown together by happenstance taking a road trip together? Due Date was OK, but it's been done, and they made the rookie mistake of putting everything good into the preview. Despite the great cast, I say pass on this one."" ]"

Chloe Moretz was amazing as Abby, following her role in Kick-Ass, this girl is definitely going places. I didn't like Abby much thou. I found her very manipulative, not to mention how creepy it is that an ageless vampire, who looks like a little girl, is hooking up with a 12 yrs old kid. While the critics loved this film, I saw it as a dark, slower, more gory version of Twilight, except with younger kids. To be honest with you, the whole thing kind of just weirded me out."" ]"

With a Dick story, you know to expect certain things. A love story, some really cool special effects, and an ending that can lead you anywhere. The Adjustment Bureau doesn't disappoint, following the Dick model to the letter,  the story is solid, unique, and imaginative. The lead, Matt Damon, gives you exactly what you'd expect out of him. Emily Blunt along side, gives an equally strong performance. The one knock on the film has to be its single mindedness. The objective never changes and the Congressman's love for Elise, a woman he hardly knows, is borderline obsessive. It is a little slow and narrow minded, but overall it's a great story and far from predictable."" ]"
scream-4;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Let's face it, when a film franchise makes it to a fourth film or higher, it usually sucks. What else can they really do with it and what's left of the story to tell us that we don't already know? That was my thinking going into Scream 4, but when it comes to Wes Craven, you really never know what you're going to get. After pumping out three movies in four years, Craven took eleven years off before taking another crack at Scream, thinking why not make what's old new again, and it works! Scream 4 continues the legacy of the series by combining a classic slasher film with the technology and youth of today, who are still making a mockery of the whole situation. The screenwriting is absolutely genius, as is evident by the opening scene, which actually rivals the scene in the first film. In Scream 4, we see a grown up Sidney Prescott return home to Woodsboro a changed woman. She's there to promote her new book and catch up with her old friends, Sheriff Dewey and his wife Gail. They're all having a nice reunion, on what turns out to be the anniversary of the first killings, when all of a sudden things turn ugly again. You know the characters and you know the actors playing them. They're a little bit older, they're a little bit wiser, and they're every bit as energetic and interesting as they were in the first three films. The old school Woodsboro family meets the current Woodsboro family and what you get is something that's very similar, but oddly different. Scream 4 is witty, clever, and updated. Wes Craven was right, what was old is new again and it reminded me of just how much I loved the original films."" ]"
source-code;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""I love movies that make you think, and Source Code will do that, the problem is, that what you're thinking is probably what's going to happen. This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best performances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the way that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out."" ]"
bridesmaids;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Ever since this movie came out, I've heard great things about it, still, I was hesitant to see it. I mean bridesmaids, a wedding, I just wasn't sure. It was however produced by Judd Apatow, and that alone made me give it a chance. Basically, Bridesmaids is a girls version of The Hangover meets Knocked Up, with an almost trip to Vegas and without the hangover. Kristen Wiig is the writer and star of this film and she was great! I'd never even heard of her before this film came out, but after seeing it, I want a lot more. It seems pretty hard for a woman to make it in comedy, it's a fairly rare event, but she's got a tremendous future ahead of her. As for the story it's pretty solid, it's a comedy, so you're not really looking for realism, just something cohesive that you can follow and this definitely fits the bill. If you're looking for something funny, but different, I'd highly recommend this film."" ]"

To be honest, the only thing I've seen him in were the Twilight films and I  hated them! In Abduction, Lautner shows that he's more than just a pretty face. Not only can this kid act, but he's a martial arts expert too! The story is super strong and he is supported by some great veteran character actors, like Sigourney Weaver. The story follows a boy, who while doing a school project, finds a picture of himself on a missing person website. It leads him into an unbelievable story, full of twists and turns. It's unbelievable, yes...but still good! It's an action film, with a very solid background story and some fairly big names. Don't let the big name Teen Idol starring in it, keep you away. If you love a good action film, like I do, this one's a winner!"" ]"

When the series started, both John Cho and Kal Penn were virtual newcomers, but now they've been in some big films and TV shows. The pair are much better actors than they were in the first film and are better equipped to pull off the ridiculousness. In their third film, Harold and Kumar have actually been estranged for a while. When a mysterious package shows up for Harold at Kumar's apartment, the two are brought back together and are forced to work together to solve a problem. Everything you saw in the first two films and everything you've come to love about Harold & Kumar are back, including THE Neil Patrick Harris. There aren't many surprises here, by now you basically know what you're going to get with these films. What is new, is the Director, Todd Strauss, who actually does add a few interesting things to the film. Harold and Kumar is a lot of laughs, in a ridiculous story, filled with drugs,  and alcohol. If you didn't like the first two films, you won't like this one any better, but for what it's worth, I dare you to watch it and tell me you didn't laugh out loud at least once."" ]"
the-son-of-no-one;4;1;Tss5078;"[ ""In 2006, Dito Montiel made a name for himself by writing/directing the story of his youth in Brooklyn, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints. In that film and in several others that have since followed, Montiel has shown an amazing ability to take little known stories from his neighborhood, and in amazing detail, tells those stories from multiple angles, introducing the world to complex and amazing stories that to the world, were nothing but a blurbs in the newspaper decades ago. The Son of No One is one of such story, and while it is an amazing one, with an outstanding cast, it's Montiel's attention to detail that ultimately comes back to bite him. Jonathan White (Channing Tatum) has become a New York City Police Officer and he has done so at a somewhat older age than most other people do. There is a bit of a learning curve, but White seems to be catching on quickly, but his education comes to a quick halt when he and his family start receiving messages claiming to know that White killed two people in cold blood. The story here was terrific and unbelievably true, not to mention the cast was impeccable, so what's with the low rating? As I said, Motiel's films are always very detail oriented and focus on all the angles, The Son of No One is no different, however, in this case, they spend to much time on the back story in flashbacks. There isn't enough focus on the events taking place in present day, and when Channing Tatum is on screen, he's usually doing nothing that relates to the case, i.e. arguing with his wife, talking to his partner, learning to be a cop. By the time we get the end, it seems to jump out of nowhere, as if forty-five minutes of the film is just missing somehow. Not to mention the flashbacks are also out of order, further confusing the story. I understand artistic license, but this isn't Pulp Fiction and I was confused for much of this film. That being said, the cast is still terrific and Dito Montiel is one of the most underrated writer/directors in Hollywood. The Son of No One is a miss, but don't let that turn you off to the rest of amazing body of work."" ]"
thor;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The great and powerful Thor was one of the biggest grossing movies of 2011. The special effects in this film were really some of the best I've ever seen and the star of the film, Chris Hemsworth was amazing, but besides that, this film was extremely overrated. Thor is banished to Earth for disobeying his father, the King, and must live as a mortal. Surprisingly, it doesn't take him very long to adjust, and he falls in love with Natalie Portman during a fifteen minute car ride. Okay, so the plot was weak to begin with, but the special effects could have more than made up for that. What I really didn't like about this film was just how fast everything happened. Thor is going to be in the Avengers trilogy and there is a good possibility there may be a sequel to this film, so what was the point in rushing everything? The character of Thor is a majestic one. He is one of the most powerful superheroes that ever existed. This film should have been the epic classic that was talked about for years, but instead they rushed the story and hid behind some great special effects. It was visually impactful, entertaining, and had a great star, but a side from that, this film is nothing more than a common theme with a weak script."" ]"

At the age of twenty-five, your clock starts ticking and your goal is to work in order to survive. The wealthy are immortal, while the poor die at a young age. The story is refreshingly unique and the film is done very well. Justin Timberlake stars, and shows that he's come a long way in a short time. When I heard he was starring in this film, I thought it would be another great idea destroyed by a cast of good looking people who can't act, but I was wrong. Timberlake shows he's got definite potential to be a big action star and that his n'suck days are way behind him. Cillian Murphy is also terrific as the timekeeper. What I love about Murphy is even when he's a good guy, he's still the guy you're rooting against. His personality makes him the perfect adversary in just about everything he does. In Time, is original, unique, fast moving, and intense. In a Hollywood full of re-makes, sequels, and uninspiring ideas that mimic one another, In Time is a breath of fresh air and was one of the most enjoyable and original films I've seen all year."" ]"

Unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see, The Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title, and follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a party, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help and decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that can get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational, not to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen all year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big upside. It has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a very tumultuous time in American History, and I can't recommend it enough!"" ]"

It gets even more difficult when you're joking about things you're not supposed to joke about. In 50/50, Seth Rogan is the best friend/comic relief and while he's hilarious as always, it doesn't really fit with the tone of the film. For the most part, 50/50 is an inspiring story about a young man fighting for his life. While the writer tries to use comedy to lighten the mood, I felt that all it did was distract me from the story and bring the quality of the picture down. As always, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was absolutely incredible and continues to be the most talented and underrated actor in all of Hollywood, but I guess that's what happens when you get your start on an overrated sitcom. Those looking for another hysterical Rogan/Pot inspired comedy will be disappointed by this film, and those looking for a touching drama, may also be disappointed by the inappropriateness of it all. I liked the film a lot, even though it tries to blend two things into one, rather unsuccessfully. Simply put JGL makes this film, Rogan doesn't fit, and there's only about a 50/50 chance you're going to enjoy it."" ]"

This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a  old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was."" ]"

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story. Not an award winner by any means, but it's certainly something that will entertain you for a couple of hours."" ]"

At the time, it was considered to be revolutionary, but at this point it's getting a little old. How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two."" ]"

Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell.

The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has.

we-need-to-talk-about-kevin;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Americans are fascinated with criminals, and most films about them either focus on the criminal or on the people who are trying to catch them. With the recent uptake in school shootings, the one element that is often overlooked is the parents and what, if any, their role is in all of this. That is the focus of award winning film, We Need To Talk About Kevin. Kevin (Ezra Miller) has always been an angry, troubled kid, brought up by an upper middle class family. Kevin had a loving family, everything he could ever want, but still orchestrated a horrific mass shooting at his school. Despite all evidence to the contrary, his mother (Tilda Swinton) can't help but think that somehow everything is her fault, and by and large the community agrees. This is far and away one of the strongest performances I've ever seen Tilda Swinton give, and that's saying a lot, because she has always been terrific. Watching this was almost difficult, as one could actually feel her pain and see in her eyes the emotional toll everything had taken on her. She did nothing wrong, but everyone from the press to the owner of the local grocery store, blames her for the actions of her son. The film flashes between before, during, and after the event to show the differences in the lives and personalities of the characters, in a way that I've never seen before, it was really ingenious. This film delves deeper into the heart of darkness and into the eyes of the unseen victims in one of the most powerful films I've seen in years.

She is terrified of the man, but he assistant doesn't know any better and wants to make a name for himself by going after the legendary medium. I am in utter disbelief that a film with a cast like this was direct-to-film, but all that aside, it's as good a story as you'll find on the big screen. What can you say about De Niro and Weaver that hasn't been said a million times before, but this film is almost like a passing of the torch, as Murphy got the majority of the air time. How'd he do, Cillian Murphy absolutely stole the show right out from under them, in what is easily his best performance to date. To be honest, this is one of those films I watched for the cast, I wasn't super interested in the story and at times it was painfully slow, but Red Lights has some downright creepy moments, and the ending will absolutely blow your mind.

I loved the concept, but this film falls way short of expectations. I believe the purpose of military is the service and protection of our nation, but in Act of Valor the Marines are portrayed as trigger happy Americans. We see the Marines, following up on CIA Intel, going into four different foreign countries, shooting first and asking questions later. Is this really the image of our military that we want to portray to the rest of the world? Regardless of what's real and what's not, these Marines come off as ruthless, with an attitude of  you we're American, we'll do what we want.' As expected, the action scenes were some of the best and most realistic I've ever seen. I would except nothing less, being that the film features men who have been in actual combat and know what it looks like. The acting, also as excepted, was really awful, but for the first time in the twenty month history of this blog I won't blame the actors for it, since after all, they aren't really actors. The action sequences alone more than make up for the  acting job, but again, I have a real problem with the message this film is sending out to the world. Chronicling the heroism and every day life of a U.S. Marine is admirable, but portraying them like Bruce Willis in Die Hard isn't doing them any favors, in fact it's making an already difficult job harder."" ]"
lockout;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""Luc Besson is the Writer/Director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Usually when you sit down to watch one of his films, you're in for a treat. When he said he was making a new film that combined elements of both popular movies, I was excited, and then sorely disappointed. Lockout introduces us to a new kind of a prison, one that is in outer space, and holds it's prisoners in cryogenic stasis. The daughter of the U.S. President (Maggie Grace) was set to tour the facility, to make sure the prisoners are being treated fairly, when all hell breaks loose. Wanting to restore order with a minimal amount of casualties, the President sends in one man, his best C.I.A. operative, Snow (Guy Pearce), whose job it is to save the hostages. For starters this film is so full of cliques and references to other things that it almost becomes a farce of itself. Guy Pearce is the star and he was very good, however his character plays like John McClain in Outer Space. Snow is full of jokes and is this huge tough guy, who was almost a mirror image of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The only thing missing was a catch phrase and lets all be thankful for that. Pearce is paired with Maggie Grace, who as in Taken, finds herself as a hostage once again. To her credit, she was a lot less whiny than in Taken and even fights back a little bit, but she basically played the same character that she always does. I don't know about you, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for a beautiful spoiled blonde girl who gets into trouble because she traveled to Europe or had to take on the cause of prisoners rights. Overall, there was a lot of action, but not much of a story to play on. Guy Pearce does a pretty good job, but Lockout is honestly a predictable, paper thin story, with special effects that aren't anything to write home about. It's another big budget film that tries to wow audiences with a unique setting and lots of explosions in the previews, but the only surprise here is that the usually reliable Luc Besson fails to deliver a worthwhile film."" ]"
the-hole;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Kids get a bad rap in films. It is assumed because of their age and lack of experience, that they are less talented than adult actors. While in many cases this is true, it is not the rule. Some people I spoke to, immediately had no interest in The Hole, because of it's young cast. Right away they were saying this is going to be a rip off of Goosebumps and didn't even give it a chance. The film may not have been the scariest film I've ever seen, but it had a great backstory, a lot of suspense, and some very talented young actors. Those kids play Dane and Lucas, who are forced to move from the city to the country, to hide from an abusive father. The boys are miserable and decide to explore the old house the family has rented. What they find is a giant hole in the basement, with seemingly no bottom. As they continue to be fascinated by the hole, things in this small town, and especially in this old house just continue to get stranger and stranger, leading to a tremendous ending that will teach the boys, that sometimes the only thing you can do is face your fears. The star of this film is Nathan Gamble, who has done a lot for someone so young. I've seen him in a bunch of things and weather he's playing Commissioner Gordon's son in The Dark Knight, or the young activist in Dolphin's Tale, Gamble just has this way of always pulling at the audiences heart strings. Once again he's this cute, innocent kid, who's been traumatized by years of abuse, yet he still manages to face his fears, unleashed by the hole. I've seen plenty of films where kids in this situation just run away and hide, but that's not his style, and that's part of why this movie isn't a Goosebumps story. The bottom line, I think The Hole will appeal to Science Fiction fans more than Horror fans, despite the fact that it's labelled as Horror. The young cast is refreshingly energetic, curious, and eager, all things that will become contagious, and make the Hole, a much better film than you think it's going to be."" ]"
the-raven;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""165 years ago, Edgar Allen Poe was on his way from Boston to Virgina, preparing for a new job. He never made it and was found on a bench in Baltimore, near death. He was delusional, wearing someone elses cloths, and kept repeating the name Reynolds, before he died. To this day, the cause of death and his reason for being in Baltimore are unknown. On the anniversary of his death, I decided to watch The Raven, which contrary to popular believe is not a remake of an older film. This story is a fictional take on Poe's last days, as the writers have Poe assisting local police in catching a serial killer. A killer is on the loose in Baltimore and using Poe's stories as the inspiration for his crimes, so who else is more qualified to help catch him than Poe? I am not a big fan of period dramas, as most are historically inaccurate and move at a snails pace, but the Raven was different. As fiction, it is of course extremely inaccurate and features Poe has an eccentric has been and a fall down drunk, but surprisingly the film is fast paced and really keeps you on the edge of your seat. The idea of using Poe's stories as the inspiration for a real murderer, who tries to copy his stories to the last detail was really brilliant and it plays very well, especially to fans of his work. John Cusack plays the mysterious writer and by this point in his career, I'm convinced that the man can play anyone and be believable. In thirty years, there isn't a role he wouldn't take on and I'm hard pressed to remember even one instance of him failing to be spectacular. The Raven is a stand alone film, with a common title for films featuring Poe, however this one is a great mystery that incorporates very little modern day thinking into the story. The Raven has everything you'd expect from this type of film, simply set 165 years ago. From police chases on horse back to wild 1800's costume parties, this film really surprised me with just how good it was and most definitely gets labeled as a must see movie!"" ]"

A group of friends are traveling through Europe in what looks like a shot for shot remake of Hostel, when they meet a man who gives tours of the abandon city near Chernobyl. After being rejected entry into the city, the group sneaks in and runs into a whole mess of trouble. This is your very basic zombie film, with nothing extraordinary about it. You've seen this story a hundred times, but what makes Chernobyl Diaries different is that it takes place in Russia and features a talent cast. What's interesting about this cast is that none of them have any background in horror. Jesse McCartney is a singer who does mostly voice over work, and Devin Kelley is almost strictly a TV actress. Taking these role was something new for them and they really put all they had into it. I feel like it was wasted effort though, as this film really is nothing different. Friends on vacation go to a unique location and run into something supernatural that tries to kill them, it's been done over and over again. The unique location made for a great start to something, unfortunately the writers didn't know what to do with that, and the result is another ordinary film that gets an average rating."" ]"
hit-and-run;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Hit & Run is a wild ride that never should have worked, but surprisingly it does. The story doesn't appear to be deep or complicated, and just when you think they've come to the end, a whole other angle begins. The film is further helped by a large cast and a whole bunch of interesting cameos, that help take it to another level. Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) is happy living in a small town with his girlfriend, Annie (Kristen Bell), but things are about to change. When Annie gets offered a job in L.A., Bronson must decide whether or not to go with her, which also means leaving the safety of the witness protection program. When a jealous ex learns of the plan, he finds out who Charlie really is, and thanks to Facebook, connects with the men he's hiding from, making the trip to L.A. a dash for safety, across California. Dax Shepard is not an actor I find to be very funny, but this was the first time I've seen him play a character as deep as Charlie Bronson, and he was terrific. He is being perused by Bradley Cooper of all people, who I did not see as someone who could play the bad guy. His good looks and charming personality, don't exactly lead one to believe he'd be believable as a bad guy, and while he wasn't the toughest bad guy I've ever seen, he does more than an adequate job. Hit & Run isn't an award winning film, it may not even be all that memorable, but it is extremely entertaining and an edge of your seat thriller ride. The perfect film for those who want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show."" ]"

When I saw he was going to be in an action thriller, about bike messengers in Manhattan, I couldn't wait to see it, but sadly I was very disappointed. It's a normal day for bike messenger Riley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as he picks up a package and goes on his way. Everything is fine until a strange man tries to run him down and steal the package. From there its a race through NYC to see who gets the mysterious package first. Premium Rush is Gone In 60 Seconds on bicycles. The plot is weak, the story is predictable, and the whole film is basically one big chase through Manhattan. Yes, Premium Rush is exciting at first, but after a half hour, it gets very tiresome, very quickly. JGL tries his hardest to turn this film into something, but even a star of his caliber can't save this film, because there really isn't anything to save. It's as if the producers said, lets have a car chasing a bike in New York City and develop some kind of story around that. It doesn't work, because seldom I have been this bored and frustrated by an action movie. It stars one of my top 10 favorite actors, but there really isn't much of a role for him to play. I really hate to say it, but this film is a complete loser, don't waste your time on it."" ]"
the-bay;5;2;Tss5078;"[ ""The Bay is a message hidden within a film, similar to 2008's the Happening, The Bay tells of the consequences of destroying our environment. In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash-cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view."" ]"
the-bully-project;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Today kids are killing themselves and each other at an alarming rate. The one thing all these cases seem to have in common is bullying. There was bullying when I was a kid, but 3 PM meant the end of the trouble. We had the rest of the day, the weekend, and the summer to recover. The advent of social media and cell phones has made the respite obsolete, as now, bullies can torture their victims 24/7. Bully is an award winning documentary that looks at the problems of bullying and shows the effects it has on children's lives. What I like about this film is that it showed a whole group of students from different economic, social, and ethnic backgrounds. What I took away is that anyone who is even slightly different in anyway, could be a target. What I didn't like was the solutions the film offers. Their solution is to tell someone and to stand up for kids you see being bullied, but anyone who has been bullied will tell you that those are not good ideas. Often times telling someone will anger the bully and make it worse, and as for standing up for other kids, often times that makes someone who wasn't previous bullied, a target. I think the answer is two-fold, in that first, parents need to tell their kids, from a very earlier age, that being unique, different, and even weird are admirable qualities in a person. I also believe the schools need to be tougher, because honestly, does anyone really think that giving a bully detention, telling them they're not nice, and that their hurting other kids really does anything? I think bullies need a taste of their own medicine, to feel those powerful emotions for even for just one day. You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you don't really know what something is like until you've experienced it for yourself."" ]"
the-numbers-station;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""John Cusack is a terrific actor and he proves it once again in The Numbers Station. Recently, Cusack has done a lot more direct-to-video stuff, deciding to be a big fish in a much smaller pond, and it has worked out very well. The Numbers Station is a secret CIA base in a secluded part of England, where encoded messages are sent to agents in the field. Emerson (John Cusack) was one of those agents, until his conscience caught up with him, and he is assigned to guard the station, a quiet, lonely job, until terrorists break in, and he is the last line of defense. A movie like this, with a small cast in a secluded location, only works if the stars of the film can keep you're attention and make the story believable, and both Cusack and Malin Akerman both do a terrific job of it. This movie is more about the intensity of the situation and the reaction of the people involved than it is about killing bad guys, and that is why Cusack was perfect choice for the lead in this film. Few actors bring the experience of intensity that John Cusack brings to a project. The story here, wasn't anything unique or extraordinary, but it was an action film from a more psychological point of few. Most action films are more about big explosions and special effects, the story is secondary, but in The Numbers Station, things are reversed and that's why I liked it so much. It's a fun film, that will keep you guessing, with a cast that will engage you the whole way. It may have been an independent direct-to-video film, but it has the bite of a much larger beast."" ]"
sinister-2012;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Original ideas in horror are hard to come by given the nature of the genre. The fans all want to be scared, some want blood and gore, and do we ever really want to see a happy ending? The idea behind Sinster was simple, lets give fans a little bit of everything and see how they react. Seeking peace and solitude, real crime writer, Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), moves his family to the country, unaware that the house he's living in has a checkered past. That is until he finds an old movie projector with 8mm films, that will horrify the man to his core. Having children as the perpetrators of these crimes was my favorite part of the film, I love it when horror movies do that, because what could be scarier than an evil child. You take the most innocent thing in the world, turn it evil, and once that happens what can you do about it? Would you be able to shoot a kid? So how do you stop them? The idea is bone chilling. I also liked the fact that they touch on every aspect of the genre they could from ghosts to possession, from gore to jump scares, they really did include a lot. The problem however is that the film focuses on Ethan Hawke, who tries to shield his family from what's happening, while investigating the events on his own, and this makes the time in between events move at a snails pace. With so much going for it, this is a movie that should have a lot going on, not long periods of nothingness. Personally I'd like to see the story focus on a child and watch as he/she transforms into one of the kids in the 8mm films, that would be cool. For what it's worth, this wasn't a bad film, the cast was pretty good, and they did a lot with what they had, but ultimately Sinister just moved a little too slowly for me."" ]"

Someone from the groups Facebook page messaged me, telling me it was right up my alley, so I decided to give it a shot, and you know what, they were right! Dark Skies is portrayed as something completely different in the trailers and ads. I was under the impression that it was another of these crazy awful demonic possession films, but it was a whole lot more interesting than that. The Barrett family is experiencing some weird occurrences in their home that they can't explain. At first it seems like the kids are pulling pranks, but they come to realize it's much more serious than that. The family has become the target of an alien race known as the grays, and are fearing an eventual abduction. Felicity herself, Keri Russell, gives an interesting performance with a cold, quiet, intensity that was something to see, but the real star of the movie was young Dakota Goyo. Goyo is best known as the annoying little kid in Reel Steel, but he's grown up quickly, and was simply the most realistic character in the whole film. What makes Dark Skies unique is it's fantastic ending, which was very unexpected, and much more eclectic than one would expect to see in a film like this. Some fans complained that the ending was too reminiscent to that of 1408, and while it was similar, unlike 1408, the ending of Dark Skies wasn't nearly as predictable. The ending comes out of nowhere and as far as I'm concerned, it's the cherry on the sundae. Dark Skies wasn't as technical or scientific as the most of the Sci-Fi I like, but it was still quite entertaining and the ending made a good film that much better."" ]"
a-good-day-to-die-hard;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Die Hard was once a great series that featured a loveable charachter facing down the improbable, with great action, in a compelling story. But, the improbable has become the impossible in it's fifth installment, with over the top special effects, a weak storyline, and some very dry acting. I am an action junkie and Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, but the essence of John McClane died a long time ago. Right from the start I could tell that Willis wasn't all that into this and it shows, as McClan goes from being the ultimate tough guy to a man just going through the motions. The story centers around reuniting with his son in a foreign country, which I though was an interesting twist, but the angle as well as any semblance of a story was barely touched upon. Die Hard 5 was just one over the top action scene after another, with very little substance, emotion, or appeal for audiences. The John McClan we knew and loved, the man who saved the Nakatomi building, is long gone, instead he is replaced by an emotionless man who expects this sort of thing to happen to him wherever he goes. Willis was going through the motions for a big pay day, and while there were some good lines and some great action sequences, there isn't much of a story or cast to write about. Die Hard 5 is about making money through special effects, using characters who have long out lived their usefulness. If this is how the series has evolved than I pray that this will be the end of it. If the producers want to milk more money out of the franchise, maybe they can wait ten years or so and have some British hunk remake it, with Willis making a cameo, until then, I must declare the Die Hard series official dead with A Good Day To Die Hard."" ]"

Looking to escape the insanity of their every day lives, the boys decide one summer to build a cabin in the woods, where they can live off the land like men. Nick Robinson stars as Joe, and gives a performance that is out of this world. In a film that stars three kids in the woods, it would be very easy for things to turn stupid very quickly, but as the leader of the pack, Joe not only keeps the group together, but keeps the story together. No matter what this young man does over the course of his career, he will have a hard time duplicating what was easily a career defining performance. Robinson is paired with Disney star Moises Arias, who until now I thought was just this weird little guy they used to guest in their shows. Arias plays Biaggio, easily one of the funniest characters I've seen in a very long time, some of the things that come out of his mouth are just fall on the floor funny. As the kids enjoy their time in the woods, their parents really start to show their crazy, as they go on a hunt for the lost boys. The characters were all unique in their own way, but Joe's father, played by Nick Offerman, was far and away the best, leading the parents the same way, his son lead the boys. From gigantic wontons to turtles on kites, The Kings of Summer is an extremely enjoyable film and the rare instance of a film that I wish was longer. I truly loved every second of this smart coming of age comedy, for it's uniqueness and young exciting cast. Blending dramatic and comedic elements, The Kings of Summer is that perfect mix that takes you from laughter to tears and back again. For that, this film is an easy choice for one of our must see movies!"" ]"

Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff. To be honest, I thought it might be good for a few laughs, but I never thought this film would be as good as it was. It has a message and makes an impact, while being a funny, edge of your seat thriller. This was really not something I would usually go for, but my recent Walking Dead inspired zombie craze put it on my radar and it was an amazing ride."" ]"

His boss has learned that their main competition, his former employer, is about to unveil a revolutionary piece of new technology, that can change everything. Fearing for his companies future, Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) decides to give Cassidy the opportunity of a lifetime, that is if he's willing to break a few dozen laws or so. Liam Hemsworth was terrific, giving a performance similar to the one Bradly Cooper gives in Limitless, as a guy with an important job that's in way over his head. Hollywood finds these good looking guys and the truth is that a lot of them have nothing to offer, but Hemsworth proves that he has the talent it takes to star on the big screen. In the film he's supported by a real all-star cast, that includes Harrison Ford, Richard Dryfuss, and Gary Oldman, all of whom do what they've been doing for half a century, making great films even better. The only reason this film isn't getting 5 stars, is the same reason it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. Paranoia is about corporate espionage and at times, the business aspect is confusing and makes us feel as overwhelmed as Hemsworth's character does. Other than that, I can't find a thing wrong with this film, it is absolutely one of the best edge of your seat thrillers I've seen all year and easily earns the right to be called one of our must see movies!"" ]"
the-wait;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""The Wait is the type of independent drama that the critics always love and that I usually hate. I decided to watch it though, because of one very special cast member, who is really coming into his own, Devon Gearhart. Even since I saw this young man in the movie Canvas, I knew he was really something special. Gearhart's unique ability to get the viewers to empathize with whatever character he is playing, gives him a strength that very few actors have. I knew from the description that the character of Ben, in The Wait, was a perfect outlet for him to express this ability and he does not disappoint. As for the rest of the film, it is a dark, eclectic film, full of odd symbolism and strange music, that to be honest is a bit over my head, but it's also a film that most audiences can relate to. The family portrayed, whose last name we never know, is pulling together and preparing for the tragic death of their terminally ill mother. The family is preparing themselves for the worst, that could happen any day, when they come in contact with a psychic. The psychic tells them that their mother is special and destine to come back from the grave, leading the family to not only hold off on making any funeral plans, but the prediction leads them to prepare a welcome home party. As I said the storyline is strange, the film is full of strange symbolism, and it moves rather slowly, but the cast here is unbelievable. Aside from Gearhart's out of this world performance, that will leave even the toughest person in tears, both Chloe Sevigny and Jena Malone are fantastic as the two eldest sisters. The sisters, always at odds are trying to pull themselves together for the inevitable, but are once again drawn apart by the psychic's prediction, leading to a dramatic rift in the storyline. The bottom line is, that The Wait, isn't a film for me, but I can see many people really enjoying it. The story is unique, the performances are terrific, and the future of Hollywood may be on display in this relatively unknown masterpiece."" ]"

You can't blame them for wanting to work with people they're comfortable with, but not many Writer/Directors, remake the exact same movie with a slightly different twist. Brian A.

Less than a year later, he followed it up with The Outsider, which is basically the exact same film! The Prince featured a former mafia turncoat, going to the city he once owned, in order to find his missing daughter. The Outsider features a former member of British Special Ops, coming to America, to find his missing daughter. Both films have similar endings, mafia bosses that are played by legendary action stars, and oddly enough, both films have a cameo by 50 cent. These two films are literally so similar to one another, that aside from the British accent, and Jason Patric in the role of the cop, nothing has really changed. As a fan of action film, I realize there aren't many different directions these films can go in, but to release what amounts to the exact same film, a year later, with several of the same actors, is just bizarre. The Outsider wasn't a bad film, and I did enjoy Craig Fairbrass, he was a beast, who I was previously unfamilar with, but aside from that, this is the exact same story as seen in The Prince. Wheather you chose to sit through this one or that one, really depends on who you like better, James Caan or Bruce Willis."" ]"
oldboy-2013;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Ever since the success of the Grudge, 10 years ago, American filmmakers have been looking to popular overseas films for original ideas, many times simply remaking them. To many, this seems like a desperation move for original material, but I see it more as a cultural thing. Movies often reflect the society of the country they were made in, and by remaking them in the United States, the story introduces movie lovers to something unique, from a different culture. I personally find this very desirable and have appreciated many of these remakes, even when I didn't love the story. In his latest venture, Spike Lee takes on the Korean classic, Oldboy. This is a film that was remade simply because of how bizarre and shocking the story is. The year is 1993, and Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) isn't a great guy. For some reason, he's drugged and then locked away in a pretty decent looking room without doors or windows, and held there for exactly 20 years. Then, just as suddenly as he was imprisoned, he was released, and goes on a search for answers, in this seemingly new world. Josh Brolin stars and is usually pretty good as an ancillary character, but as the star of a thriller, I was skeptical. As always, he could have shown some more emotion, but he was much better than I thought he'd be. Spike Lee gives him as much help as he can, by giving him a huge cast of supporting actors, all of whom had name recognition. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson playing a psychopath, was very funny, and definitely injected some much needed humor. Oldboy is one of those films where it all comes down to the ending. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won't say anything other than to tell you, that it is bizarre and twisted, with an ending the likes of which you couldn't possibly have imagined. Even if you start to watch this film and don't really like it, stick with it, because the ending really is that good."" ]"

I find them to be cliche, over the top, and so far from reality, that often time the stories are just the lowest form of Science Fiction. The only movies of the superhero genre that I've ever truly enjoyed are the recent Batman trilogy and some of the recent Marvel films. That being said, I hated the first Thor film, because it came directly from a comic book and lacked any kind of background story whatsoever. Thanks in part to the Avengers and the development of the Loki character, that all changes with the second film. The story isn't directly from a comic book, but rather based on one. In this film, the characters are more established and there is a lengthy background story that only enhances the film, and the series. In the second film, Thor is tasked with stopping a deadly weapon, possessed by an all but extinct species. This weapon has the power to destroy the entire universe and as always, the focal point is on Earth. Unable to stop the weapon and save his girlfriend at the same time, Thor turns to an unlikely source for help, his now imprisoned brother, Loki. Given the magnitude of the story and the power of the enemy, I'm a bit surprised that they didn't keep this film to be used as an Avengers sequel, as it has all the makings of an epic sequel. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and this time he is beyond terrific. His role in the Avengers really enhanced the popularity of a character that most people were unfamiliar with, and the tremendous start to the film really set the framework for Hemsworth to take Thor to the next level. Even the supporting cast steps it up a notch as Natalie Portman is more used to the idea of a boyfriend from another world and being involved in things she couldn't possibly understand. Finally, Tom Hiddleston tops of the story, with his portrayal of Loki. I may be going out on a limb here, but I thought Hiddleston was even better in The Dark World than he was in The Avengers. Going into the Avengers, next to The Hulk, Thor was the weakest of the introduction films, and the least known and appreciated character. That all changed with the Avengers and in his second film, the Thor character steps up to a level that rivals even Iron Man. If you're not that into the series and have only selectively seen a few of the films, make sure you include the Dark World, as it is essential to fully understanding Thor and his impact in the future of the series."" ]"
hellion;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""Coming of age films are a dime a dozen, and what it really comes down to is the stregth of the young actor or actress. The way it usually works out is that the better they are, the better the film is, and when it comes to Hellion, casting was dead on, but there was also something else that made this one special. After losing his mother, Jacob Wilson (Josh Wiggins) started acting out. Maybe his fathers transformation into a full blown alcoholic had something to do with it, or maybe it's the fact that he's left to be the adult and take care of his little brother that's the problem, but whatever the case it gets a whole lot worse. After stupid teenaged behavior causes his younger brother to be taken away and placed with his aunt, Jacob has to become the adult and convince his father to clean up in order to bring his little brother home, a herculean task, when you consider the fact that Jacob himself is still a wreck. The young star of the film, newcomer Josh Wiggins is absolutely terrific, outshining multiple award winning actors and actresses in this film, but he's not the only difference here. Hellion takes on the dark southern poverty stricken surreal feeling of other similar films that have become extremely popular in recent years. Similar to Winter's Bone, Joe, and Mud, there is an aspect to this film that is methodical and real. It's almost like you aren't watching a movie, you're just seeing real life unfold in front of your eyes. This combined with an extraordinary young talent made this extremely enjoyable to watch. Everything was very raw, emotional, and just real, a credit to both the writer, director, and cast involved in Hellion. This style is fairly new in cinema and has really defined the 2010s era, to see it combined with something that was so relate-able made for a very special film."" ]"
when-the-game-stands-tall;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""The one thing you can always count on when watching a football film, is that it's going to be exciting. It doesn't matter if it's a true story, like When The Game Stands Tall, or a made up one like Friday Night Lights. It doesn't matter if the team has won 100 straight games or lost 100 straight games. Every film about football is going to be exciting, so what makes one better than the other? The personalities involved, it all comes down to who the film is focused on and this film has it's eyes on the prize. Jim Caviezel stars as Bobby Ladouceur, one of the most successful high school football coaches of all-time. Ladouceur became a national celebrity, not only because of a big winning streak, but also because of the way he incorporated family values and religion into his coaching, trying to make his player more well-rounded individuals. Caviezel was outstanding, as he is in everything, but after watching six seasons of Person of Interest, it's almost disappointing seeing Caviezel in a role where he doesn't kill anyone. The other focus of the film is Alexander Ludwig, who portrays Chris Ryan, a kid who has all the talent in the world, but has to decide, if he's pushing himself toward greatness for himself or because of a psychotic father. Ludwig always gets second billing, but as with the Hunger Games, nothing would be as good without him. He is the unsung hero of this film as he rounds out the emotional roller-coaster. When The Game Stands Tall has action, emotion, conflict, religion, family, love, hate, a little bit of everything and believe it or not, at the heart of it all is a simple, stupid little game called football. This film was great, it reminded me a lot of the TV version of Friday Night Lights and it's an absolute can't miss for sports enthusiasts."" ]"
into-the-storm;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Many people say that Into The Storm was too much like Twister, but that is only partially correct. Twister was the story of storm chasers, trying to beat another team to the punch in getting data from inside a tornado. Into The Storm also has storm chasers, but they're only a part of the story, as it also features the town caught in a super storm, and a family caught in the middle. If you want to compare this film to twister, simply because of tornadoes and storm chasers you can, but Into The Storm still wins, as it features a better background story, better special effects, and is overall much more intense. Richard Armitage stars as the High School's assistant principle, that goes into the storm to find his missing son, and save other people in the path. While the British Actor isn't known for anything more than The Hobbit, he showed real intensity and fortitude, making the film so much more exciting. He's paired with storm chaser turned rescuer, Sarah Wayne Callies, best known for her roles in Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Callies usual plays the strong female character with great ideas, the leaders right hand if you will. In this film however she is little more than a follower, leading to a performance that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. When you have a film with the popularity of Twister, anything else that features anything even remotely similar is going to be compared to that film and ultimately called a rip off, and parts of it could be considered that. When watching the film and now reflecting on it, I prefer to think of it as updating a great idea with a new cast, story, and effects. You are free to disagree and if you're one of those people who think of it as just another rip off, I'd still recommend seeing it for the special effects, if nothing else."" ]"
the-maze-runner;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""The Maze Runner series really appealed to me and long before it was a movie, I read all four books. I was hoping that like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner would be a page for page telling of the story, but it wasn't and in fact several important elements crucial to the sequels were left out. The story begins with a boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in an elevator, surrounded by dozens of other boys. Thomas has no memory other than his name and quickly learns that none of the other boys do either. They are all trapped in the middle of a maze with no idea why or how to escape. This film was done well, but compared to the book, it is like a seventh graders book report. All the players are the same and the events are relatively the same, but all those little things that made this series so special and unique were left out. The film is just a simple story with some terrific special effects, but the book was really extraordinary and non-readers will never have any idea of just how good this movie could have been. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars and really was the perfect choice to play Thomas. Unlike some of the other casting choices, O'Brien really seems to jump right from the pages to the screen in a defining role that almost seemed made for him. Thomas was the same in the movie as he was in the book, but he was the only one. It's very hard to be objective about this, because if I hadn't read the book, I still would have enjoyed the film, but realizing just how much of the story is missing really bothers me and skewed my review of the film. The story is unique, the special effects are great, and their some very good young actors here, I still highly recommend The Maze Runner, but if you are a reader and you enjoy Science Fiction, by all means read the book first."" ]"
felony;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""After the biggest drug bust of his career, veteran Detective, Malcolm Toohey (Joel Edgerton), enjoys a few drinks with friends before driving home. On the way, he barely clips a paperboy on his bike, but what should be a minor incident, becomes big trouble when the boy is badly hurt in the fall. Toohey calls the police, telling his fellow Detective, Carl Summer (Tom Wilkinson), that he was driving home and found the boy laying there. Summer believes him and lets Toohey on his way, but his young partner, Jim Melic (Jai Courtney), doesn't believe the story and despite his bosses orders, refuses to let it go. The story here is pretty solid, the investigation and police work that go into it are very interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie isn't focused on that, as its mostly about Malcolm Toohey and his conscience. We watch as the man turns into a shell of his former self, as he struggles with what to do next. This should be an interesting sub-plot, but not the whole premises of the movie, as it slows things down tremendously. This film moves at such a snails pace, that the terrific and unexpected ending, become almost farcical. Joel Egerton is really terrific in his role, showing how one split second can change a persons life forever. The whole cast was really good and it's a shame that such talent was wasted. It's not that Felony is bad, it's just slow, and lacks the action a police drama should have. That being said, if you're into watching people battle their inner demons and fight their conscience, you might enjoy this film, but to me, it was somewhat boring."" ]"
alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day;8;5;Tss5078;"[ ""When something fresh and successful comes along, everyone wants a piece of it. Shortly following the films release, a number of copycats emerge and to be honest most of them are terrible. Maybe it's because we tend to compare it to the original or maybe it's because the scripts are rushed and just aren't that good. In any case, after the release of the Wimpy Kid series, we saw a lot of these family comedies, centering on the not so popular kids, and as expected, most of them were awful, with one notable exception. Alexander's bad day focuses on a young man whose birthday coincides with his first day of middle school, which doesn't go so well. After receiving no sympathy from his family, Alexander wishes that they all had their own bad day, and the results were hilarious. This isn't the typical PG family comedy you see from Disney, as it was quite raunchy for them and really pushes the boundary of that PG rating. Ed Oxenbould stars as Alexander and fits the role like a glove. Oxenbould looks and sounds kind of awkward, after all it is a strange age, but watching him gave the feeling that he's not all that unfamiliar with being unpopular. Possibly playing on real life experience, he rivals Alex Gordon with a performance that was not only believable, but it was also very funny. Another advantage this film has over the Wimpy Kid series is that the young cast has help from some of Hollywood's elite, as co-stars include Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner. The pair give a lot of support and the producers use them to break-up the middle school monotony that would has surely ensued. While not my usual genre, I loved the Wimpy kid series, but Alexander's bad day is more than an adequate alternative for those who are looking for something a little bit different."" ]"
white-rabbit;6;3;Tss5078;"[ ""Coming of Age films are among my favorite types of movies, but if you're a fan of the genre, you know there are often a lot of strange stories out there, perhaps none stranger than White Rabbit. This film follows Harlon Mckay (Nick Krause), who is a very strange kid, one that is often bullied. Harlon is very easily influenced by other people, as is evident by the scenes with his co-stars. When he's with his best friend, whose immature, they do kid things, and when he meets a bad girl, who doesn't stay in on place very long, Harlon gets into some trouble himself. There's no doubt that Harlon is strange, but so are the circumstances surrounding him. Newcomer Nick Krause plays the troubled lead and he really was terrific. In ninety minutes, this kid must of changed personalities a dozen times, and all of them were tremendous. White Rabbit is very weird, a little creepy, and nothing special until a shocking ending changes everything. Sometimes how you see a film can be changed by an ending that just blows the mind and answers a million questions at once. That is what happens here, and that is the only reason I recommend watching this film. As I've been saying, it's really strange and some parts are hard to sit through, but in the end, you'll be left thinking about what you just saw and wondering about each and every scene. Honestly, it's the kind of film you really need to see more than once if you're hoping to catch everything."" ]"
tracers;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Taylor Lautner may always be remembered as Jacob, the annoying werewolf boy from the Twilight Series. People have a hard time seeing him as anything else, but Tracers is the second action film I've seen him star in, and this kid has the perfect make up to be a huge action star. Lautner is more than just another good looking actor, as he can speak several languages, is a martial arts expert, and an avid parkourer, all skills he uses in his latest film, Tracers. Lautner plays Cam, a down on his luck bike messenger, who comes to befriend a group of parkour enthusiasts. What they do fascinates Cam and he wants to join them, but when he does, he realizes that they aren't just clowning around, they use their skills to commit crime, and once he's in, Cam has no way out. Original action films are hard to come by, as most people are satisfied with all the special effects and dead bodies. It's a genre that really doesn't call for originality, that's why when you come across a film like this, it's a breath of fresh air. The stunts and moves you see in this film are nothing short of magic, and it's star Taylor Lautner did them all himself. We are so used to seeing Lautner as the sensitive love interest in some romanticized film, that it's hard to even imagine him as an action star, but that changes 10 minutes into this film. It's the stunts, the attitude, his characters whole personality, that makes his a unique a-typical action star, and it is really something to see. On the surface, Tracers may be nothing more than another story about a group of burglars, but what they can do is extraordinary, and was really fun to watch. This film is original, fast paced, and brings to light a new action star, who isn't in his sixties or the WWE. It may not have all the bodies and explosions normally associated with this type of film, but as I said, It was a lot of fun to watch."" ]"

Next to some strange device is a wall with thousands of pictures of them! At first they think the man was just a pervert, until the next day when they realize the machine is a camera that is taking a picture of their apartment, 24 hours into the future. With the help of their friend, Jasper, the couple decides to use the technology to get rich, but it doesn't take long for the local criminal element to realize what's going on, and try to take a piece of it. Most writer/directors don't hit a homerun their first time out, but in this case, with the help of a young up and coming cast, that's exactly what Bradley King did. This film is very engaging and has you on the edge of your seat, combined with an utterly shocking ending, this is the kind of film that you will still be thinking about days later. It's amazing to me that something of this quality was never released in theaters, but it is just as good, if not better than any thing you'll see on the big screen. The one drawback is that it does take a little while to get moving, hence the bad reviews from people who can't give a film more than twenty minutes, but once it gets started, Time Lapse quickly grabs hold and never lets go. It is refreshingly original and has a young cast that is every bit as intense as the film itself."" ]"

transporter-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Once again, we have a Statham movie, where the story isn't the focus and doesn't matter much at all. The allure of this film is the terrific characters created by Luc Besson. The mysterious driver with OCD is back, but is well into his retirement. Instead of helping the bad guys get away, Frank Martin (Statham) is driving rich people around, but he's forced into action when their young son is kidnapped. The story here is somewhat simplistic, but the bad guys are as creative as you will ever see in this type of film. I'm not sure where they found Alessandro Gassman and Amber Valletta, but they were so much fun to watch. He is a self-obsessed drug lord, with ridiculous moves, and big plans, while she is a deadly assassin, whose ability with a gun would put John Wayne and Clint Eastwood to shame. When Statham is added to the mix, you have the perfect formula for one intense movie. Transporter 2 was terrific in that it never stops moving and you will see things you never thought were possible outside of CGI, it was unbelievably entertaining. From the stand point of a film aficionado, while these amazing moves and characters make for a lot of fun, the story and dialogue are severely lacking. This film is not for people looking for a great story or loveable characters, it's made for adrenaline junkies who want to see explosions, long fight scenes, and intense thematic action. If you're all about the action, you won't find much better than this, but if you want there to be some greater purpose, a worth-while cause to fight for, or want to see the world become a better place because of all that happened, you'll be disappointed."" ]"
ted-2;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""In 2012, Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane, introduced the world to Ted, a talking teddy bear. People thought he was crazy, but the vulgar bear quickly gained a cult following and was a rousing success. The first film was really nothing more than an introduction to Ted, that showed just how extreme a talking teddy bear could be, but it lacked a real story line, and the jokes quickly got old. That however is not the case with the sequel. In Ted 2, the newlywed bear is not getting along with his wife. To save the marriage, they do what many couple do, and decide to have a baby. After failing to obtain \""celebrity\"" sperm, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt, but the state has other ideas, as they determine, Ted can't adopted because he's not a person, he is property. From their Ted has to use every means at his disposal to prove he's a real person. This sequel has an interesting story and Seth MacFarlane finally decided to play on his strengths in regards to a film. Instead of these long drawn out jokes that seven people in the world get, he utilizes cutaways, the same way he does on Family Guy, and it really makes a difference. Half way through the first Ted, I was bored of it already, but Ted 2 is genuinely funny and can hold your interest throughout. This is the kind of film I always expected to see from Seth MacFarlane, and even people who hated the first film, will not be disappointed. Ted is certainly a unique character, but when he's portrayed in the proper setting, he becomes exactly what he was originally intended to be, hilarious!"" ]"
avengers-age-of-ultron;7;4;Tss5078;"[ ""Writer/Director Joss Whedon received so much negative feedback from this film, that he actually deactivated his Twitter, but I can't understand why. It's not that Age of Ultron was a bad film, in fact there were many parts of it that were very impressive, but what bothered people was how Age of Ultron wasn't geared toward general audiences. In the first film, even if you'd never seen a Marvel film, you could follow the story and enjoy it, but that's not the case with the sequel. Age of Ultron is aimed more at the comic-con crowd and parts of it were very confusing to those of us who aren't familiar with the comics that the film is based on. There are a lot of new characters and new technologies introduced in this film, without any kind of background information given, and as the film progresses, it did become confusing. The story begins with the Avengers as a separate faction from Shield, centering on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) working to develop a new type of artificial intelligence. The pair believe that if they can create this intelligence, everyone can retire and won't have to fight anymore. As always there is a problem though, as the A.I., known as Ultron, comes to life and fails to see the distinction between saving humanity and destroying the planet for the protection of humanity. The film then becomes a race for the clock as the mighty Avengers try to stop Ultron from destroying the planet. We all know that sequels aren't as good as the original, because the creators change things too much and Age of Ultron is no exception. The story isn't even close to as strong as the first film, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. The special effects are even better and the chemistry between the large cast is much more important then it had been previously. These things set the foundation for a better film, but the story fails to deliver. The Avengers is a monumental undertaking for cinema, with so many well known actors and characters trying to come together as one. The idea is ingenious and the technology behind the whole thing is nothing short of magic, but as far as films go, while I loved the first one, I could have done without Age of Ultron."" ]"

While this may work well with superheroes, it has yet to be successful in regards to comedy. That is why the film, Love The Coopers can be defined with one saying, too many cooks in the kitchen. This film features a large and impressive cast, and the previews looked terrific, but I assure you, Ed Helm's little girl calling him a dick, is just about the only truly funny moment in this film. The story here has a lot of different angles, and they do come together quite nicely, but this film is not what it was intended to be, as the last thing I would refer to it as is a hilarious holiday film. A lot of people are going to see this film because of it's cast, and from young Timothee Chalamet to veteran Alan Arkin, this cast is remarkable, however the story is not, in fact this whole film was fairly dull. I expect a lot from the cast, but even Hollywood's best and brightest can't make a film work when the writing just isn't there.

The first film in the series, was nothing like the book, as it completely failed to demonstrate the comradery among the boys, as well as eliminating key elements from the story. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who noticed this, as The Scorch Trials made sure the same mistakes didn't happen twice. Of course the same elements that were ignored in the first film had to still be excluded for the sake of continuity, but the rest of the film was dead on. In the second film, the boys learn that their rescue was only short lived, as they are still under the control of Wicked, and are about to face their second test. The group is to be dropped into the most unforgiving part of the earth, a place where the disease runs rampant, and cranks are everywhere, the Scorch. If they can survive the Scorch, the boys will have a better idea of what they are up against, and Wicked may just be able to get what they need from them to finally find a cure, that is if they make it to the end. Unlike the first film, Dylan O'Brian finally embraces the leadership role that Thomas is supposed to play in the series, and gives the film the hero to root for that it was sorely lacking. The additions of Jacob Lofland and Rosa Salazar further move the story along, as the film starts to pursue the side angles much in a way the novels did, something the first film also ignored. The narrow focus of the first film, combined with it's rushed nature, and missing elements, made it seem like a cliff notes version of otherwise terrific novel. The sequel however takes the time to properly tell the story, explore the angles, and was much closer to the original story. If you're not a reader and you were turned off by the first film, I don't blame you, but give the sequel a chance, it's a much more accurate depiction of the story."" ]"

I don't know how the story in the comic was, but I can tell you this, Ant-Man is the perfect character for the big screen. The special effects are nothing short of magic and take the concepts of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids to a whole other level. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) created a new technology, one that was so dangerous, he buried the research deep in his company archives, but when his successor comes across it years later, he develops it, despite warning from Pym. In order to stop this from getting out, Pym recruits an unlikely hero to help him, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Lang is one of the best burglars around and Pym hopes to use these unique skills to get back his work. The only thing is the company's lab is impenetrable to all, except bugs. Using his prototype, Lang becomes Ant-Man and that is when this film really gets fun. Paul Rudd is absolutely terrific in this movie, as a small, nerdy, awkward guy, he can be hysterical under the right circumstances and this was just the perfect role for his personality. Rudd is paired with Michael Douglas, who 10 years ago wouldn't have even considered doing a film like this, showing just how powerful and influential the Marvel brand has become. Out of all the Marvel films to date this is perhaps the most interesting one. The cast is amazing, the special effects are outstanding, and I may never see Thomas The Train in the same way again. If you're like me, and not crazy about superheroes, don't let that stop you from seeing this film.

Criminal is in the same boat, as audiences have been kept away by the complicated plot, which also seems to work quite well. The film starts with the brutal murder of a CIA agent, who has a secret vital to national security in his head. Out of desperation, the CIA turns to a doctor and an experimental procedure, which will allow the agents memories to be transferred into someone else's mind. The only problem is that the procedure requires a certain type of mind, the mind of a psychopath. Against his will, Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner) is transferred to CIA headwaters and given the agents memories, but will he become the good agent and help save the world, or will he return to his murderous ways? Kevin Costner stars and reminds us all of what a terrific actor he truly is. It's hard to remember, considering that for the passed two decades he's done mostly romantic garbage, that you couldn't pay me to sit through. Costner returns to action as if he'd never been gone and does an amazing job playing this deeply conflicted, flawed man. Paired with an all-star cast, that features a ton of cameos, Criminal never slows down and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's not really the CIA crisis or the science fiction that keeps your interest throughout, it's the conflict growing in Jericho Stewart's brain, as he has essential turned into a person that is both good and evil. Yes, the story is a bit complicated, but it is fairly easy to follow, and Kevin Costner gives his best performance in at least a decade, making Criminal well worth the price of admission."" ]"

This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it! Apocalypse might not have been as good as First Class or Days of Future Past, but it certainly wasn't a stinker on the level of Last Stand, the way that most critics portrayed it to be."" ]"

Griffin Gluck was fantastic is his first starring role, but the rest of the cast really didn't have much chemistry, and overall the film just wasn't all that funny. Rafe Katchadorian (Gluck) is a troubled kid, who is sent to his third and final Middle School in the district. It's very strict and if he doesn't follow the rules, he could be headed to military school. Once he gets there, Rafe learns that his principle (Andrew Daly) is beyond strict and decides to get back at him by anonymous breaking not one, but all his rules, causing a school wide rebellion. The story seemed like a good one, but the truth is the pranks weren't all that extreme or funny. The kids in the theater laughed more at the preview before the film than they did at the pranks in the movie. There were also times in the film where you expected the typical crude middle school humor, and while the writers set it up, they never delivered the punch line. That's not the only issue with this film, the kids had some chemistry, but the family didn't. Lauren Graham was terrible, as her character was completely different than that of her kids. She had no connection to them or any idea what was going on with them. But for as bad as she was, it was nothing compared to how awful Rob Riggle was. I have never been a fan of his, but he was beyond annoying in this film, his personality is just so obnoxious and over the top, that the last place he belongs is in a family film. Finally, the whole animation angle brings the movie to a dead stop. Gluck's character is an artist and likes to draw, and at times throughout the film, his drawings come to life in his imagination and take the place of what's happening on the screen, often at the worst possible times. The bottom line, for young actors in a family film, Gluck and Thomas Barbusca did a terrific job, but the story fails to live up to expectations, the humor just isn't there, and the whole thing was full of scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor."" ]"

All you can do is inhale the psychedelic haze the permeates the movie, let go of reality and let things unfold.  Unfortunately, there isn’t quite enough substance to the story line to sustain the movie’s almost 2½ hour run time.  Joaquin Phoenix, as, always, gives a terrific performance.  The cast is deep (including Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Beneicio Del Toro, Maya Rudolph and Jena Malone).  Brolin is perfectly cast for his role, which is a send-up of the quintessential 1960’s LA police detective.

walking-with-the-enemy;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Inspired by a true story, this film follows a brave young man (Jonas Armstrong) who poses as a Nazi officer to save other Jews in Budapest. This well-constructed (if not somewhat formulaic) film depicts German cruelty and the bravery of those who stood up to them. It's attractively shot, well acted and directed with passion. Although the drama sometimes gets a bit heavy-handed, it remains an absorbing fim with a charismatic leading man. My minor beefs: everyone speaks with accents (in their own language!) and Armstrong always has a 5 o'clock shadow (which the Nazis would never tolerate)."" ]"
patriots-day;10;4;TVJerry;"[ ""Mark Wahlberg plays a police officer involved in the search to find the terrorists behind the Boston Marathon bombing. This is one of several POVs in this gripping drama: It also explores stories of several survivors, the law enforcement procedures behind the pursuit and even the activities of the criminals. Director Peter Berg depicts the horrific event with electrifying skill and maintains the tension throughout the search, which includes several potent action sequences. The continual drone in the soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross helps keep the pressure up. The cast is uniformly outstanding with Wahlberg exploring new emotional depths in his best screen performance yet. Not only is this a riveting, suspenseful police procedural, it takes an empowering patriotic stance that ultimately yields a moving final message."" ]"
loving;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""This film is based on the true case of Mildred and Richard Loving, an interracial couple who lived in Virginia (where the film was also shot) and ultimately challenged the miscegenation laws in the Supreme Court. This film quietly tells their story without overblown outrage or extreme emotion. Director Jeff Nichols lets images, especially faces, poignantly tell as much of the story as the minimal dialogue. With the sweetly touching, skillfully underplayed performances by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga (both of whom will surely see Oscar noms) their situation is rendered even more poignant. Some may find the pace slow, but I found it quietly compelling. In addition to the historical significance of the case, this film beautifully portrays the enduring love that made their relationship transcend racial boundaries."" ]"
deepwater-horizon;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""The focus of this film is not on the environmental damage caused by the titular oil explosion, but on the crew members who fought and died during the disaster. Mark Wahlberg plays one especially heroic worker, but the true star is director Peter Berg (look for him in a cameo when the helicopter lands). He sets up the culture with quick-cut macho exchanges, but his magnificent recreation of the chaos and calamity makes the experience exceptionally gripping. It's a dizzying outburst of devastation. While the film clearly indicts BP as the greedy villain, the epic endeavor to avert, then survive the disaster, is riveting."" ]"
the-birth-of-a-nation;9;3;TVJerry;"[ ""For those who don't remember their history, Nat Turner (played with poignant power by Nate Parker) was a slave and preacher in 1800s Virginia, who led the country's largest slave rebellion. This film, which is a masterful first effort by writer/director Nate Parker, doesn't revel in the violence or extreme cruelty. Even though there are appropriately brutal moments, he's chosen to focus on the emotional experiences that led to Turner's transformation. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are forceful. It takes a bit too long to build momentum, but once it does, the film builds to moving and powerful final image."" ]"
bad-moms;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Mila Kunis stars as an overworked, underappreciated mom who decides she's had enough of the constant pressure to be perfect. She makes 2 friends (Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn, who creates the movie's most enjoyable character) and they set out to make the title come true. This is the ultimate chick flick. The audience was almost exclusively women and they were loving it. The script crammed full of F-bombs and wacky acts, much of them funny. As is the fate of many modern movies, it sometimes tries too hard to be outrageous. The mom message gets a bit heavy-handed, but there are moments of genuine sweetness that adds to the appeal. Fun for moms and highly relatable with its amusing approach."" ]"
nerve;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Emma Roberts & Dave Franco get involved in an online game that dares them to take increasingly dangerous risks. Meanwhile, more and more \""watchers\"" goad them on. This spins the concept of Pokémon GO into a social media thriller that's pretty effective.

While the kids are all intellectually accomplished and physically trained, their encounters with civilization (and their mother's relatives) prove challenging. This unique story is filled with moments that are charming and captivating, thanks partly to the sweet, sensitive performances of the children (and Mortensen, of course). There may be scenes that strain credibility, but the way the story is told provides a fascinating and ultimately engaging look at a very special family."" ]"
free-state-of-jones;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Matthew McConaughey gets most of the screen time as a defiant Mississippi farmer who starts his own rebellion against the Confederacy. There are parallel stories about his relationships with several slaves and a flash forward to a racially-charged court battle in the 20th century. A lot's going on and even with the deliberate pace, it manages to maintain interest. Writer/director Gary Ross has purposely let this sprawling story take place slowly and took advantage of McConaughey's star power with lots of lingering close-ups. The cast is strong and that helps, but this film is dramatic, solemn and noble…a mighty effort to make important cinema…and it somewhat succeeds. Plus, it's based on a remarkable true story, which makes it more interesting."" ]"

Her attitude changes after her mother dies and she falls for the hot new (much younger) man at work (Max Greenfield). This is really a vehicle for is Field, who is sweet and funny in her wonderful, wacky ensembles of vintage clothes. There's lots to like in her character's spunky attitude and enthusiasm for life. Being embraced by a hip New York crowd may be pushing reality, but she manages to pull it off. Greenfield is charming and the supporting cast adds some spice. Even though it sometimes tries a bit too hard to be eccentric and clever, the pace is lively and the writing is humorous. Still, it's Field's engaging performance that makes the film so appealing."" ]"
elvis-nixon;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This comic tale is based on an actual event in 1970, when Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) showed up at the White House to request a meeting with President Nixon (Kevin Spacey). Shannon portrays The King as a sincere, misunderstood and misguided character, while it's Spacey who gets to satirize the President with hilarious results. The run-up to the encounter unfolds effectively, but isn't especially funny. Actually, other than Spacey, there aren't a lot of laffs. It's more about quiet humor than big comedy. Still, this fictionalized version of what happened is fun to watch"" ]"
midnight-special;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""A father (Michael Shannon) is on the run from a religious cult and the FBI with his young son, who has special powers. There's a constant sense of ominous portent, potential danger and unknown consequences. And the final payoff is pretty cool. The cast does a good job of taking matters seriously and the special effects are simple, yet convincing. This is a low-budget sci-fi thriller than poses more questions than it answers. Still, there's enough mystery and tension to make for a compelling experience. Not really sure why the title (based on the song) is relevant."" ]"

Her obsession to reunite with her former husband is complicated by her new look and his greed. This import by Christian Petzold (\""Barbara\"") has the deliberate pacing that's common with European films, plus the somewhat dispassionate solemnity that's stereotypically German. Still, the performances are absorbing (esp. Hoss), the story is compelling and the filmmaking is solid."" ]"
the-walk;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""If you saw the doc \""Man On Wire\"" you already know almost everything that happens here. As a matter of fact, this almost feels like another doc. Highwire walker Philippe Petit (appealing portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) narrates his story on camera with flashbacks that recreate his effort to walk on a wire between the World Trade Center towers. His tenacious resolve is recounted with considerable detail, but without much dramatic involvement. However, once he starts his incredible feat, the movie becomes riveting. You know it's all CGI, but the spectacular vistas and numerous dizzy angles create a distressingly tense experience."" ]"
the-end-of-the-tour;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Jesse Eisenberg plays a Rolling Stone writer who spends 5 days interviewing David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel), the author of acclaimed novel \""Infinite Jest.\"" This is essentially a road trip that absorbingly explores the awkward, anxious relationship that develops during their short encounter. Segel is subdued, yet compellingly complex, as he handles the character's elaborate discourse and emotional density.  Eisenberg plays the role of eager, besotted listener with his typical hesitant confidence. Even though this is primarily a duo dialogue, the skillful screenplay by Donald Margulies and controlled direction by James Ponsoldt help make every moment enthralling. A fascinating exploration of creativity, ego and communication. NOTE: Stay thru the closing titles for one last moment."" ]"
dark-places;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""A 7 year old daughter survives the brutal murder of her mother and 2 sisters. Fast forward to the adult version (Charlize Theron), when she's contacted by people who believe in the innocence of her brother, who was jailed for the crime. The film alternates between her search for the truth and the events that led up to the that traumatic night. The narrative takes its time to unfold, but maintains interest thru strong direction and compelling performances. Even though Gillian Flynn's (\""Gone Girl\"") plot is busy with coincidences, it's still interesting and even manages a bit of suspense in the final scenes."" ]"
me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Unlike \""The Fault in Our Stars,\"" which approaches teen cancer as a romance, this film goes for a quirky approach. Thomas Mann plays a high school senior, pressured by his mother to spend time with a classmate (Olivia Cooke) who has leukemia. He and his best friend (RJ Cyler) also make parodies of great films, a subplot that provides some witty cinema in-jokes (stay thru the credits for a complete list of titles). The film's eccentric humor is often clever and fun, although it sometimes try too hard. Once the story hits rocky ground, things quickly fall into emotional drama. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon has peppered the proceedings with witty angles (literally and figuratively) that add to the movie's oddball charms."" ]"
heaven-knows-what;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""20 years after \""Kids\"" comes another hard-edged look at life on the streets of New York. This follows a young junkie (Arielle Holmes) as she mates, shoots up and struggles to exist (based on Holmes’ soon-to-be-published memoir \""Mad Love in New York City\""). The film sometime feels like a documentary, often set among pedestrian traffic, with a camera that lingers in extreme close-up during the seemingly improvised, repetitive and rough dialogue. With it's jagged style, there are engrossing performances, inventive camerawork and a harsh energy that keeps it compelling. An intriguing art film that takes a raw, edgy look at heroine culture"" ]"
good-kill;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Most of this film takes place in a metal box on an air base in Las Vegas, where \""pilots\"" fly drone bombing missions over the Middle East. The other scenes follow Ethan Hawke with his wife (January Jones), as he tries to rectify his work and maintain his marriage. The tactical scenes are both compelling and unsettling, while the personal moments could have used more dramatic punch. In addition, the commanding officer (Bruce Greenwood) is asked rather transparently by the script to continuously supply the debate points surrounding this controversial procedure. While it effectively raises some contentious arguments on both sides, the film would have had more punch with a more potent emotional parallel."" ]"
pitch-perfect-2;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""After an opening number setback, the Bellas re-group to win an international competition. Every character gets a few quick story beats with Anna Kendrick as the leader and Hailee Steinfeld as the new member. Rebel Wilson enjoyably carries the comic load with help from the hilarious commentators John Michael Higgins & Elizabeth Banks (who also directed). There's lots of music with pleasing arrangements, but the staging was better on \""Glee.\"" It moves at a lively pace with youthful energy and spunky fun all around. NOTE: Stay thru the early credits for \""The Voice\"" gag."" ]"
what-we-do-in-the-shadows;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""This fake documentary follows the lives of vampire flat mates in New Zealand trying to cope with modern life (Jemaine Clement of \""Flight of the Conchords\"" is the familiar face). There's not really a plot, just their interactions with each other and their often frustrating attempts to deal with everyday life, the occasional mortal and the neighborhood werewolves. In addition to outright laffs and hip chuckles, the whole thing is wrapped in a wacky, off the wall vibe that keeps it entertaining."" ]"
furious-7;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Vin & Paul and everybody else is back for more international intrigue. These films used to be about racing, but they've slowly developed into action-filled missions to save the world with fast cars. After a sluggish start, this one slams on the accelerator and speeds thru one outrageous sequence after another. Forget the laws of physics, the viability of human endurance, even common sense…this film is all about stunts that are hilariously over the top. Don’t worry about plot or dialogue and enjoy the macho posturing. Even though it's sometimes hard to follow the geography of the fights, they're still hard-hitting and sprinkled with clever camera tricks. Go for the pure popcorn thrill to enjoy this wild and crazy ride!"" ]"
danny-collins;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Al Pacino is appealing as an aging rock star who decides to reset his life after he discovers he never got from John Lennon. Even though the situation's unique, not a lot about the story is original. Annette Bening provides a charming romantic flirtation and the granddaughter is delightful. It moves along with enuff pluck to occasionally amuse and gradually work its way into our hearts. One of the best things is the soundtrack, which is full of Lennon's wonderful songs. A sweetly charming addition to Pacino's resume."" ]"
while-were-young;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts play a settled New York couple who meet a hip duo (Adam Driver & Amanda Seyfried). Charmed by the younger couple's free-spirited approach to life, the 40-somethings develop a fast friendship and forsake the trappings of their mature mindset. Just when this film's age premise starts to wear thin, the relationships develop deeper implications. Stiller ably handles the humor in his character's dilemmas, but it's Driver quirky personality that charms the screen. Writer/director Noah Baumbach has created a sharply-observed satire on the generation gap that provides more chuckles than laffs. Still, this perceptive parody is fun. NOTE: Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul & Mary plays the subject of the film's documentary."" ]"

They get deeper and deeper into the deceptive world of fast fingers and fast-talking, while their romance complicates matters. The twists provide a few surprises and the characters are interesting (esp. Robbie, who's not only beautiful, but charismatic). The pace gets thick before it ends, but it's still slick and entertaining escapism."" ]"
big-eyes;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""In the early 60s, Keane paintings of pitiful waifs were all the rage. Turns out that Margaret (Amy Adams) painted them, but her charismatic husband (Christoph Waltz) took the credit. He also revolutionized the commercialization of popular art. Their first happy, then tumultuous marriage takes a repetitive long time to get to the courtroom showdown, which also goes on too long. Adams turns this halting, insecure character into a nuanced and compelling performance. Director Tim Burton minimized the bizarre flourishes expected from his work, to tell a straightforward narrative. While it's a fascinating story and Adams is worth the ticket, the film feels more like an informative historical replay, than a moving personal drama. NOTE: Look for the real Margaret in a conspicious cameo on a park bench behind Adam's easel in an early scene."" ]"
top-five;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Chris Rock wrote/directed/stars in this examination of a popular movie comic who attempts to restructure his career as a serious director. The film is structured around a discussion/interview with a New York Times reporter (Rosario Dawson), as he goes thru the day promoting his film's opening (and runs into a variety of entertaining cameos). Most of the comedy comes from Rock's signature irreverent insights, even when they come out of the other actors' mouths. Much of it is amusing and sometimes funny. Rock's performance and his direction have a robust energy, but the film is more a small personal project than a riotous big-screen comedy."" ]"

Jon Stewart wrote/directed this film featuring Gael García Bernal and he did a pretty good job. The basic structure is solid and there are creative touches that show a sound understanding of the medium. It's an effectively told story, but lacks the emotional punch that would have given the days in solitary more impact. Still, it's an interesting story and a promising first effort that includes an earnest message about the freedom of speech and plight of political prisoners."" ]"
get-on-up;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""Chadwick Boseman is dynamite in this biopic of James Brown. He's got the moves and the style, while creating a character who's convincingly arrogant and occasionally touching. The story unfolds in a non-linear structure that expects the audience to know some aspects of Brown's life, but that keeps it interesting. Even with the no-holds-barred depiction of his flaws, all of his hits are performed (with the real Brown's vocals) to make the experience a super-funky groove. The Godfather of Soul's genius is fully on display (especially on stage), but this film does a good job of detailing the emotional complexity of the man. Viola Davis, as his mother, is wonderful as always."" ]"
the-wind-rises;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Considered by many to be the world's greatest animator, Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Secret World of Arrietty) claims this is his final film. He's moved away from the usual fantastical subject matter to a biography based on the designer of Japan's most lethal fighter planes. The story begins with him as a young boy, whose lyrical dreams depict his obsession with flying. When it follows his plane designer career, the story is interesting. There is a tragic subplot about the love of his life, which slows down the pacing. Thru it all are Miyazaki's sumptuous visuals: the subtle observations, the stunning landscapes, the exquisite design. Despite the simplistic script (voiced by an impressive list of American actors) and the +2hr length, this film offers a dazzling look at an innovative and magical master at work."" ]"

John Leguizamo joins the trip to add some enjoyable spice. The first half spends too much time with Favreau's character blustering and **** but once he hits the road, the story takes on a sweet charm. This is the kind of small personal film that started Favreau's career (before he became director of blockbusters like \""Iron Man\"") and it's a welcome return to a heart-felt, charming little gem. The music's great fun too. NOTE: Stay thru the credits to see the real chef giving Favreau some technique tips."" ]"

Combine that with crisp direction and this slight little romance takes on an agreeable slant."" ]"
palo-alto;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Based on short stories by James Franco, this film randomly follows 3 teens (Emma Roberts, Nat Wolff & Jack Kilmer) as they drink, smoke, have sex and wander thru their adolescence. The story is as aimless as their lives. There's no real structure, just scenes of wasted (literally) youth. The only major adult character is Franco who plays an inappropriate coach,  Even with though it feels like an MTV reality show, the young actors impressively create natural and complex characters and director Gia Coppola has an ability (like her aunt Sophia) to capture quiet observations and create compelling situations. Look for Jack's dad Val and Gia's great aunt Talia Shire (as the guidance counselor) in cameos."" ]"

His new wife (Nicole Kidman) discovers that his torturer is still alive, so he sets out for revenge. The mood of this film starts somber and gets more dismal from there. The story alternates between his despondent present and his awful past, while most of the intensity comes from the prison camp (naturally). Performances are all around strong and the story is compelling, but the film fails to pack an emotional wallop."" ]"
muppets-most-wanted;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The Muppets get a new manager (Ricky Gervais) who promises them success in Europe, but is really out to stage a massive heist (along with a Kermit imposter). The plot is just an excuse for each character to do its bit and to allow a few famous people to pop up for cameos. The human stars, including Tina Fey & Ty Burrell, are working hard to be funny, but don't generate lots of laffs. There are plenty of fun moments and some cute, catchy tunes by Bret McKenzie, but the script isn't that sassy. While the movie is energetic and entertaining, it falls short of being as funny as it could. NOTE: There's a zany short from the \""Monsters\"" franchise before the feature."" ]"

This is one of those roles that gives a classy actor a chance to play against type and Law approaches it with gusto: cussing, ranting and violently attacking every one and every scene. While it's fun to watch (and sometimes too much), the character doesn't draw much sympathy until it's almost over. The writing and direction are solid without elevating the film to exceptional, but Law's energy makes it worthwhile."" ]"

After interviews and research he sets out to create his own version of one of Vermeer's classics by working from a real environment. This is a fascinating concept and an amazing procedure that took years to realize. The documentation of the tedious final process is the only time the film starts to lag. Otherwise, it's interesting to anyone who enjoys an intriguing confluence of art and technology."" ]"
mandela-long-walk-to-freedom;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""The title pretty much sums it up: a walk with Nelson from rural boyhood to his election as South Africa's first democratically-elected president. Much of the journey is taken up with his early fight against apartheid and the subsequent 22 years in jail. To anyone who hasn't read the autobiography on which the film is based, this will provide interesting details about his personal life and political struggles. Although Idris Elba (Mandela) and Naomie Harris (his wife Winnie) both create rich characters and the narrative is compelling, the whole thing lacks emotional power. The prison years are the most absorbing. It should take 2+ hours to chronicle a great man's life, but it feels too long and sometimes too simplistic. Still, an informative history lesson."" ]"

When he’s put into a super-security, supercool facility, he teams up with fellow inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger to make his break. The brain-teaser plot pushes credibility, but it still unravels without ever getting dumb or dull. The action is mostly average with a few moments of flash. You don’t go to a movie with these two expecting great drama or deep meaning, just some macho fun and a few laffs. It's enjoyable popcorn escapism, literally."" ]"
girl-most-likely;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""You might have high expectations for this film, since Kristen Wiig is the star.

After an unfortunate incident she ends up back at home in NJ with her mother (Annette Bening is a delightful turn). The film tries too hard to be one of those quirky character charmers, but it sometimes succeeds, although predictably. It's not hilarious, but sweetly amusing."" ]"
white-house-down;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Channing Tatum saves the President (Jamie Foxx) and the country from an attack, while rescuing his own daughter. Yep, it's one of those stories: forget logic and ignore Tatum's seemingly superhuman ability to narrowly escape bullets and bullies. If you can do that, you're in for a well-paced good time. The intricate plot is as terrifying as it is far fetched, but the cast is chocked with strong performers that help make it work. Most of the hand-to-hand action is a blur, but the big effects are cool. After all, Roland Emmerich (:Independence Day,\"" \""2012) is directing. Mindless fun."" ]"

It was shot in 12 days at his own house using his cast member friends (not movie stars). He's given the romantic comedy a more somber tone, shot it in classic B&W and injected some musical interludes (which he also wrote). The performances are all strong with Nathan Fillion adding in a delightful turn as Dogberry. If you enjoy the Bard, this contemporary restaging is attractive, well-crafted and entertaining."" ]"

There are other supporting roles that add to the humorous momentum (notably the school administrators). This movie is as light and predictable as a TV episode and some of that could be the director, Craig Zisk, a talented veteran of the medium.

They get their fix and kicks by robbing the homes of celebs (yes, they actually shot in Paris HIlton's real home). The thin plot revolves around them hanging out, trying on clothes, doing drugs and \""shopping\"" in the famous homes.

There are some names in the cast (Kate Hudson, Kiefer Sutherland, Liev Schreiber), but it's Ahmed's charisma and complex performance that makes this film so effective.

It's a mostly feel-good story about their mostly fun adventure, but the toll of racial discrimination always hovers. The script is sometimes clunky, but the performances are plucky.

The cast (including many real retired musicians) finds great fun in the lively performances by Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon and Pauline Collins.

He quickly meets a shy closeted hunk (Garret Dillahunt) and they end up fighting for custody of an abandoned teen with Down syndrome. This is an affecting and sweet drama that's elevated by Cumming's feisty performance (and wonderful singing), Dillahunt's lovable charm and Isaac Leyva's sweet smile. The period wardrobe is rich with wide collars and garish patterns, but it's the attitudes that provide the most jarring flashback (although they remain with us). While the subject is fodder for outrage and the story is basic, the acting and direction combine to create an appealing experience."" ]"
savages;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Oliver Stone applies his distinctive directorial style to a by-the-numbers drug plot. Two men (Taylor Kitsch  & Aaron Johnson) are ying-yang partners in a pot enterprise: one is a hot-blooded vet and the other is the Buddhist business head. The only real twist: they share a girlfriend. Their lucrative business is challenged by a Mexican cartel that results in kidnapping, deception, murder and more. While there's nothing original here, Stone has given the film a muscular force that propels the action. There are a few violent or gruesome moments and some of his signature flashy flourishes, but nothing to make this film standout. The ending (which I hated) feels like it was tacked on after focus groups. But overall, it's brassy and full of fun performances."" ]"
bernie;8;2;TVJerry;"[ ""This delightful film by Richard Linklater has been under the radar and it's a shame, because it's a hoot. It's a reality-based tale about a prissy assistant funeral director (Jack Black), who befriends a rich, mean old widow (Shirley Maclaine) and ends up killing her. The tale is told with some dialogue and lots of hilarious interviews with local residents (some of whom are real and some are actors). I'm not a Black fan, but there's none of his over-the-top antics in this quiet portrayal. Matthew McConaughey shows up in a non-glamourous role as the prosecutor. I doubt it'll be in town long because it's available on DVD 9/21/12, but it's lots of fun on any format. Stay thru the credits for additional soundbites."" ]"
wanderlust;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd play a New York couple that ends up living in a Georgia commune loaded with mildly wacky characters.

Overall, the film's not outstanding or ground-breaking, but it's an amusing diversion, especially if you enjoy Aniston or Rudd."" ]"

She gets her enduring power from the blood of beautiful women and Kristen Stewart is the most beautiful. A coarse hunter (Chris Hemsworth) is enlisted to do the dirty work. This is a visually sumptuous film that starts with ominous, potent storytelling. By the middle, the pacing bogs down with too much drama and romance, but it manages to work it's way back by the end. Theron is formidable, but Stewart is pretty flat. Despite the flaws, this film is full of rich and inventive imagery."" ]"

In keeping with the period, it's in 1.33:1 ratio black and white with a musical accompaniment. There are title cards to explain some of the dialogue (they're on screen much faster than in the 30s). Besides all these devices, the simple story proves engaging, the actors are appealing and the director has added some clever flourishes to freshen it up. This is not an important film, as much as a sweet and charming homage."" ]"

Of course, they have to round up all the classic characters (Kermit, Miss Piggy, etc). This revival of the franchise is not ironic: It gets its essence from wise-crack comedy, heartfelt emotions, numerous cameos and clever self references (including 80s nostalgia for the grown-up audience). While it's a delight to watch the old gang go at it, Segal comes off as too earnest and lacks leading man charm.

Antonio Banderas plays a plastic surgeon who's created a beautiful sort of Frankenstein. His drive for a medical breakthrough combines with grief and revenge to motivate his intense obsession. The film is visually interesting, often off kilter and intriguing on several levels, but some may find the deliberate pacing gets in the way of the film's power.

shame;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""Director Steve McQueen started as a cinema artist and that shows in his commercial work. There are extended takes & minimal dialogue (hence, slow pacing) and episodes that add up to an impression (as opposed to a storyline). Michael Fassbinder plays a New York stud, who's obsessed with sex and afraid of intimacy. As a result, there two primary types of scenes: sex (including random pickups, masturbation & full-frontal nudity) and struggle (rueful staring and disaffected relationships). It's compelling on several levels, but too cerebral to be powerful. The most shameful thing is that the distributors had the conviction to release it in NC-17 (with all the attendant barriers) and it's not worth the risk."" ]"

If you like this crew's antics, you won't be disappointed. There are even a few almost-arty slow-mo segments that magnify the impacts.

This film is based on the true story of Aron Ralston (played by James Franco), who was hiking alone in Utah, when his arm got trapped under a bolder. To keep it involving, his attempts to free himself are intercut with his survival efforts, flashes of imagination, and even humor. The exceptional editing and Franco's compelling performance solidify the effect. The self-amputation scene isn't so harrowing that it should keep you away."" ]"

The film harks back to director Robert Rodriguez's early style (a la \""El Mariachi\""): jammed cuts, hard action and ironic humor. Danny Trejo plays a renegade lawman who slices his way through the bad buys with all manner of blades. There's a plot, but it's more about enjoying the sharply-crafted filmmaking. The grindhouse style is plenty violent, but the flashes of fun and great characters make it completely cool. How often do you see Lindsay Lohan in a nun's habit, shooting one of our greatest actors?"" ]"

They've eschewed the current trend of ironic, sassy dialogue and pop culture references for simple storytelling, beautiful visuals and sweet songs.

He brilliantly examines all sides of this complex character. What's hard is that every scene goes on too long (which makes the movie too long) and Barney keeps repeating his bad behaviors (which makes the movie frustrating).

The movie basically becomes a heist flick that's bookended by two elaborate, action-packed chases. Sure, there's lots of fast driving, but it's not about racing.

The remarkable performance by newcmer Quvenzhané Wallis has you alternating between wanting to comfort her and cheer her pluck.

Overall, a bit slow and never suspenseful, but still an interesting take on the genre. (French with subtitles)"" ]"
ingrid-goes-west;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""In a young culture that's obsessed with being \""liked\"" on social media, Ingrid (Aubrey Plaza) is an awkward misfit who's overly fanatical about her image. She moves to LA to stalk her favorite Instagram influencer (Elizabeth Olsen), who's superficial, shallow and self-possessed. Comparisons to \""Single White Female\"" are inevitable and Plaza effectively captures that creepy vibe. She also manages to make her character understandable, although not ever sympathetic. Olsen's portrayal also embodies the appropriate vacant, phony vibe. The only real sincere character is played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr. who's appealing in his first role since \""Straight Outta Compton.\"" The film's desperate narrative pushes credibility in some of the relationships (esp. his), but it does tell a compelling story. After the controversy over \""13 Reasons Why,\"" it's disconcerting that a similar subject reinforces desperate behavior, even though it effectively explores the phenomenon. BTW, there's a strange little short that precedes the feature."" ]"
atomic-blonde;7;1;TVJerry;"[ ""David Leitch also directed \""John Wick\"" and his skill with action, especially hand-to-hand fights, is ramped up here. An alluring Charlize Theron plays a cool, beautiful, tough MI6 agent who's sent to recover a sensitive document in Berlin around the time of the wall's collapse. She teams up with James McAvoy, but more importantly, takes on dozens of men with painful blows and whatever object she can use as a weapon. The fight sequences are brutally forceful and even better, there's no blurry camerawork and flashy editing to hide the hard stunt work. It's all staggeringly evident. Meanwhile, the film enjoys a colorful 80s neon noir look and the period tunes provide a jammin' soundtrack. The rather conventional plot keeps turning on itself (as spies often do) and that becomes a bit much. This film is all about the well-staged chases and fierce fights."" ]"

All the actors seemed to be into the movie, especially Gerard Butler and Brenton Thwaites.  I also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as \""Ra\"" the sun God.

The animation itself was fun to look at.  It really held the attention of the kids in the theater as there weren't any squirming talking kids while it was on.  I do wish Squidward was featured more as I like his cynical personality.  The 3D effects were good as well.  It will be a Blu-ray purchase when it comes out."" ]"

She is watched like a hawk by authorities as someone who possibly may try to escape.  In the meantime, she is plotting an escape with her boyfriend who occasionally has to come to the East side of the wall for his work.  The depiction of the hospital and her living quarters is so stark and realistic.  She also begins to have feelings for her colleague Andre, who is apparently head of staff at the hospital.  The ending is not what you would expect.  The acting is great, and the cinematography is first rate.  The movie is German, so there are subtitles, but it is a slow paced film and the subtitles are easy to follow and don't detract.  Nina Hoss is wonderful in the title role and the film is sure to be a contender for best foreign film at Oscar time.  Highly recommended."" ]"

One day an elderly medicine woman (a \""Curandera\"") arrives at young Antonio's home to spend the final days of her life, and there is an instant bond between the two.  She teaches him the ways of her healing and magic, and the special relationship Man shares with the earth.  Curanderas are both revered and feared in their culture, and she is seen as an evil witch by some.  The only problem I had with the movie is that it is narrated by the older Antonio in parts, and it is never explained who he has become as an adult.  Still, a well done film."" ]"

The worse part of the film is that most, if not all of the characters have an English accent and my friends and I couldn't decipher some of the things they said.  I also noticed kids getting restless in the theater, so this might be hard for younger kids to follow.

They go to communist East Germany to capture a former Concentration Camp torturer so they can take him back to Israel for trials for his misdeeds, but they bungle the kidnapping.  I thought the film was well acted and it held my attention the entire time.  The only problem I had was that the older actors looked NOTHING like they younger ones with the exception of Helen Mirren.  They should have found actors that at least looked similar to each other.

It was also funnier, and didn't have quite so many fight scenes.  The producers have fallen into the Hollywood trap of having as much action as possible.  It needed more quiet moments like in the first film.  Still, it was entertaining and looked great, although the 3D was not worth it.  The entire time I was wishing I was watching it in the bright 2D instead of the dull, dark 3D.  It will make the Blu-Ray all that more exciting to watch I suppose.

All performances are good but Tom Hardy is the standout.  If it had any originality it would be a great movie but we've seen it all before.  Still, it held my attention and the characters were interesting.  As far as the fight scenes go, get ready for the moving queasy cam.  This director likes the horrible technique of moving the camera around so much you can't always see what's happening.  It's just a lazy technique Hollywood uses to fool the audience into thinking more is going on than your eyes can see.  Overall good but not great."" ]"
cowboys-aliens;7;1;Bikerjames;"[ ""If you believe in aliens, then you know they have been around and visited the planet in other times, so why not a movie about them visiting earth during the wild west period?  Makes sense to me.  The movie works because it is played straight up, no camp, no comedy.  I liked the first half of the movie better than the second half when it turns into your basic alien shoot-em-up, but it is still attention grabbing and fun even then.  I do get tired of Hollywood portraying aliens as slobbery, dripping beasts with fangs and claws that don't even verbally communicate with one another, but I guess we're stuck with that.  You also have to open your mind to other silliness such as the aliens using a lasso to capture their victims while flying in their saucers at high speed.  Seems kind of low-tech for such a superior being.  Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are terrific and the supporting cast is at their level as well.  Overall an entertaining summer movie."" ]"

The first Shrek movie was good (not great) thanks to Eddie Murphy, but Shrek 2 was awful.  I never saw the 3rd installment.  I've never liked the weird Irish accent for Shrek that Mike Myers provides.  It doesn't fit for me and I find it distracting.  Why is he Irish when nobody else is?  My friend talked me into going to see this one and it turned out to be a good animated movie - maybe even the best of the Shrek movies.  The script is WAY better than Shrek 2 and had some good laughs and good animation and it held my attention the entire way.  The 3D was good, not great, and probably not worth the extra cost, as 3D mutes the colors due to the dark glasses."" ]"

Yes, it has some eye rolling moments, but this movie is pure escapism similar to old movies from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  I laughed a lot at this film, and the scene where Charlotte and Miranda talk about parenthood in the bar is one of the best dramatic and funny moments in cinema this year.  Also, I don't think these critics were true fans of the original HBO show.  That series definitely had some silly moments as well.

After these two gems, Dreamworks is almost at the level of Pixar, who I think slipped a little after last year's \""Up\"".  Pixar still makes the most original films, however.  This one does have the tired storyline of the protagonist that nobody respects suddenly becoming a hero, just like Kung Fu Panda.

You would think some staleness would start to set in since this is the third Toy Story, but not so.  Not only is Pixar the best at writing original scripts for animation, they are the best at getting great performances from the voice actors.  These characters have real personalities.

I seem to love (The Wrestler, Pi) or hate (Black Swan, The Fountain) Aronofsky's films, but admire the visuals even in the ones I don't like.  I always look forward to seeing his next film, and I can't say that about every director.  The lead in this film,  Sean Gullette, is excellent, as is the rest of the cast.  I really liked the camera work and LOVED the soundtrack with the creepy noises throughout.  The story, how everything in the universe can be explained by mathematics was intriguing.  I really enjoyed the film and would watch it again."" ]"

Larry David is brilliant and I was laughing right from the start and kept laughing throughout. Some people were turned off by the pessimism and sarcasm of the Larry David character, but I thought he was hilarious. Even the other characters in the film ignored him and didn't take him seriously.  I liked it even better than Vicki Christina Barcelona or Point Blank - the other two great recent Woody films."" ]"

I enjoyed the political incorrectness throughout the film (the mother is a horrible driver, plus she leaves her 5 year old alone at home during a monster storm so she can drive to the senior center to check on their safety).  The real star of the film, however, is the fantastic drawings and color palettes.  This might be his most colorful movie he's made, and when you consider this is drawn and not computer generated some of the scenes are jaw dropping.  When you have a lot of fish in a single scene and each one is doing its own thing it must be a nightmare to animate.  Some of his movies can be a little preachy about the environment and balance of nature, but this one isn't too bad.  I do wish that animators would not use voices that are so distinctive.  Liam Neeson and Betty White have such distinctive voices that as soon as the character starts speaking, you immediately think of the actor.  I'm sure that was a Disney decision, plus actors want to voice in a Miyazaki film much like actors want to be in a Woody Allen Film because they recognize greatness.  This isn't a classic like \""Spirited Away\"", but if you're a Miyazaki fan you will probably enjoy it."" ]"

First is the relationship between Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo - I don't think that would happen in real life.  Second, and most importantly, is the way the family treats the Mark Ruffalo character at the end.  The acting, however, is great all around, especially by Annette Bening.  She should lock up an Oscar nomination for sure."" ]"

I saw this in a theater that was almost full and kids were bored and making noise the entire time so I don't recommend it for kids.  The biggest problem for me was the lack of humor.  The film will keep your attention because of the great animation, but this could have been great if the movie was funnier.  The script writers also pay homage to many other movies, (Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, High Noon and many more) by copying the most famous scenes from those movies.  The actors doing the voices do a great job.  Overall, a good animated film aimed at adults, but not enough humor to make it a classic."" ]"

melancholia;10;4;Bikerjames;"[ ""This is the best film I saw all year, and I go to the movies a lot. The first hour of the film (the wedding reception) is uncomfortable and even irritating to sit through. This is purposeful by the filmmaker.  He even uses the \""ever moving camera\"" technique that I wish filmmakers would stop using once and for all.  I should not have to take a motion sick pill before going to a movie.  We find out in the second half of the film, however, when it turns into a Science Fiction movie, why Justine (Kirsten Dunst) had such erratic behavior at her reception. The second half of the film is simply mesmerizing. Atmospheric, beautiful, scary, suspense building. Great visuals throughout the film - you will think about what you saw long after the film ends. Dunst is great in this film, but Charlotte Gainsbourg who plays her sister is equally wonderful. This film may not be mainstream enough to win awards at Oscar time, but it's not to be missed. I could write more about this great film, but I don't want to give anything away."" ]"

A word of warning, it's a Norwegian film so you will have to read captions, and you will need to be a speed reader.  I'm sure I missed some of the action on the screen while I was reading the captions."" ]"

I can't say enough about how great the two lead child actors this film are - Wes Anderson likes a certain style that requires both timing and a certain way of conversing, and everyone in the film captured it perfectly.  The story was kind of a modern day Huck Finn (although set in the 1960s).  I already look forward to his next film, and that is the best compliment I can give any director."" ]"

I have never seen any scary film that didn't have people doing illogical things (including the earlier Alien films) and this film is no different, but I was still entertained throughout.  If you think about it, if these scientists really behaved like scientists the movie would be boring.  I really appreciated that the scary scenes didn't drag on and on and on and it didn't have any scenes where the bad guy just doesn't die, even when he should be dead (I HATE that).  The CGI is flawless throughout.  Personally, I think this film is a classic.  I was still thinking about it the next day after seeing it.  If this film doesn't win every Oscar for visual effects it will be a crime."" ]"

The moral of the movie, \""It's real if you only believe\"", has been done many times in movies, and as recently as \""Polar Express\"" a few years ago.  Polar Express was a better movie for me than this one.  Still, the outstanding visuals kept my interest the entire movie and I recommend it on that basis alone."" ]"

The acting across the board was good, and the dialogue was believable.  It also had some humor throughout, unlike the over-dramatic melodrama of Twighlight.  Alden Ehrenreich was a charmer in the lead role, and the movie would not have been a success without him.

I'm sure you will be asking yourself the same question I did - how did this boy learn to speak perfect English since he was raised by trolls that don't speak English?

As always, Spielberg gets a first class performance from a child actor (Ruby Barnhill) and a terrific performance from Mark Rylance as the giant.

The film speeds by so many interesting visuals and ideas pulling you into the next one before you've barely caught your breath. However, this is definitely not a film for everyone, it is outlandish and bizarre and will often contradict its own world's rules several times in the same scene. You should definitely go in with more of a Monty Python mentality and less of a Star Wars mentality. The only major issue I had was with a 30-minute plot cul de sac right in the middle of the film. Rihanna shows up for a goofy and awkward side story that should have been completely cut from the final film; it merely provides a long distraction from the main plot and adds nothing to the overarching story. I love that she's bringing people into the theaters for fun action sci-fi films like Battleship and Valerian, but they're clearly creating custom characters for her that just aren't very good. I loved everything before she shows up and after she leaves."" ]"

There are a few head-scratching departures from the original (particularly Murphy's \""death\"" scene and the decision to go for PG-13 rather than R) and far too little screen-time for Murphy's partner played by Michael \""Omar\"" Williams, but this is a great action flick in the vein of Dredd and The Raid. RoboCop is fast-paced without feeling rushed, and the cast is fantastic, especially Jackie Haley, Michael Keaton, and Gary Oldman. RoboCop himself isn't stellar but he gets the job done. Overall I was totally misled by the critics and blogosphere who tried to cast this as an empty action romp. RoboCop has as much brains and heart as any other action movie in the past few years."" ]"

As fascinating as the premise is, it's not given adequate time for development so viewers probably called BS on it which explains the poor box office.

And then there's the bio-father and adoptive/step-father awkwardness which resolves with their teaming - so there's another preachy moment about how multiple parents should partner rather than compete. And then in the end, Po doesn't prevail due to his own inner strength but the strength derived from the combined spiritual (ugh) efforts of his family and friends. I didn't see a producer credit listed for Hillary Clinton but jeez, how \""It Takes a Village\"" obvious can you get?!  And finally, Po does the Neo into Agent Smith possession thing from \""The Matrix Revolutions\"" - no messaging there, just another example of cinematic plagiarism. I think we all would prefer more entertainment and less \""cultural messaging\"" (and plagiarism) from the cretins in Hollywood."" ]"

The slo-mo highly stylized scenes of ultra-violence were done well, human obliteration looked more authentic than ever, and this is one of the film's elements I think worked well. My biggest disappointment was with the gods, they were played simply by normal humans with little to no special effects augmentation. If I were director, at a minimum, the gods would've been an impressive 20-ft tall then it's just discretionary elements from there but that's not what they did.

Nicely directed by Lone Scherfig (“An Education”, “Italian for Beginners”),  the production values in the film are modest to say the least but nevertheless portray the efforts of the filmmakers within the film to achieve their propaganda goal and in the course of it, bring humor and sadness in unique combination as the umbrella of the blitz looms over every scene and occurrence. This is not a great film by any means but it does communicate the British grit as Londoners seek to persevere and survive a difficult time in the mid 1940’s and beyond.

The “spoiler” title tells a lot of what this movie is about but it is indeed much more. Reaching beyond his traditional roles, Mr. Gere, in exemplary fashion, portrays the part of Norman Oppenheimer, a self-styled consultant/businessman who knows someone who knows someone else who knows another who can get you the contacts or deals you are seeking. The film takes us into the inner workings of smart east coast investors to the chambers and offices of the Israeli Knesset, its cabinet and its Prime Minister, and how Norman, by conniving and sheer “chutzpah”, interacts with them all. For those familiar with Yiddish parlance, he would be commonly referred to as a “macher”, or in English, an influential guy with great connections. The interesting point in the casting is that the actors portraying the Israeli members of the cast are, in fact, Israeli, but the other Jewish roles, including Norman, are played by non-Jewish performers such as Michael Sheen, as Norman’s nephew, and Steve Buscemi, as Norman’s rabbi. Make no mistake, this film is more universal in its appeal than the semitic nature of its script would imply for it deals with drama, political intrigue, thrills and a story that will keep the viewer interested, on edge and appreciative of a well performed and well written motion picture.

The well known  Swedish actor, Rolf Lassgard. portrays Mr. Ove in this story of a widowed senior who confronts the loss of his wife and ponders his future as he meets and interacts with new neighbors and acquaintances in the small town where he and his wife lived. This is a simple film filled with simple characters who in some way or another bring hope and joy to their otherwise bland existences. What makes the film work is that it is effortless viewing as the audience, via flashback, witnesses the youth and adulthood of Mr. Ove and how, in each instance, he plays the hands life has dealt him. I give the film an 8.0 with a note to anyone wishing to see it that it will no longer be distributed and available for viewing after October 13, an indeed unlucky number for anyone who misses it."" ]"
denial;8;7;BHBarry;"[ ""“Denial” is the true story of an American Holocaust scholar, Deborah E. Lipstadt, who was sued for libel by a Holocust denier as recounted in her book entitled “Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier”. The screenplay for the film was written by David Hare based on Ms. Lipstadt’s book. Mick Jackson directed the film which stars Rachel Weisz, Tom Wilkinson and Timothy Spatt. This is basically a courtroom drama played out in the London courts and gives the audience a clear understanding of the fundamentals of the British legal system and the roles the solicitor and barrister play. Yet this is not just another Holocaust story but a rather sensitive and personal insight into those who teach about this unfortunate event in world history as well as those who lived to tell about it. Ms. Weisz’ performance is extraordinary and she communicates her dedication to the role certainly in some part because of her own personal background and experience. As a lawyer I can recite a number of improbabilities and inaccuracies that take place in the courtroom scenes but one must remember that the screenplay is based on the perceptions of Ms. Lipstadt and I believe that, had there been more input from a barrister or solicitor in the making of the film, the noted inaccuracies would not have appeared. That being said, and seeing the film as a layman seeking a good entertainment experience, this film adequately attains that goal. Accordingly, I give the film an 8 with much of the credit going to Ms. Weisz who is largely responsible for its positive rating,."" ]"

Written by Art Linson (with help from stand up comics Jeff Ross, Richard LaGravenes and Lewis Friedman) the film was directed by Taylor Hackford (‘The Devil’s Advocate”, “Ray”, “An Officer and a Gentlemen’). Unfortunately, with all of these fine participants, the film is a disappointment and leaves the viewer with a feeling that, somewhere, in all of this writing and acting, there is a good film that never quite made it to the screen. Mr. De Niro’s character is an aging once famous television star seeking a comeback as a standup comic. Instead, he becomes a coarse deliverer of smut and insult that makes his audiences (both on and off the screen) squirm in discomfort and, in comparison, makes Don Rickles look like Mother Teresa. Mr. De Niro, as always, radiates a likeable persona but even that wonderful trait cannot save the film from earning only a 5 rating. He, Mr. Hackford and the writers could have done much more with the seeds of a good idea that never quite grew into a worthy flower of entertainment."" ]"
paris-can-wait;3;2;BHBarry;"[ ""\""Paris Can Wait” stars Diane Lane, Arnaud Viard and Alec Baldwin (who appears for about 30 seconds)  in this movie written and directed by Eleanor Coppola via the vehicle of her husband, Francis Ford Coppola’s production company,  Zoetrope.  I mention the matrimonial  ties between the producer and the writer/director because ,were it not for that, I doubt if any other film producer would invest in such a project. The film is thin both in terms of substance and character development and, quite simply, is nothing more than a view of French scenery on  a road trip to Paris with gourmet dining along the way. As with most French specialty dishes, the presentation is more appealing than the amount of food to be digested and the analogy applies to this film as well. How many plates of appetizing food and rare wines can one member of the audience absorb in the 92 minutes it takes for the couple to arrive at their destination. Ms. Lane and Mr. Viard are fine actors and do their best with the limited material given them but, unfortunately, the audience, like Ms. Lane’s character, would have wanted the trip to Paris to have been faster and with fewer gastronomical stops. I give this film  1 star  with a suggestion that theaters offer free Tums or Rolaids with each ticket. Better still, just as “Paris Can Wait’, the viewer might be advised to do so too, at least until the film is ultimately exhibited on TV (if a non-Coppola entity will air it)."" ]"

More than that, Wikipedia says that he held it for over the next ten years. The guy’s called Vinny Paz and he’s 54 now, by the way."", ""So yes, it’s another sports movie aiming „to the infinity and beyond“… but it doesn’t go all Hollywood on our asses and actually manages to be a really good indie watch, having both heart and balls."", ""„Bleed for This“ came out back in September and circled some festivals before reaching cinemas. The commercial success of the movie, sadly, hasn’t been worthy of its tough-as-nails hero. It pretty much came and disappeared without a splash and hasn’t gotten any award nominations either, big or small. Quite why the producers and distributors didn’t believe in the project enough to support it some, for Globes and Academy Awards campaign, at least, is beyond my comprehension. It’s a true underdog story, also a sports movie – who doesn’t like those, eh? – and also good movie in general. (Probably the post-Trumpian USA needs more unpretentious happy tales like „La La Land“ which has just managed to pick 7 out of 7 Globes.)"", ""OK but what makes „Bleed for This“ so great, then? Isn’t there enough underdog and sports movies, award-winning or otherwise? Well, I am glad you asked. In short, I like everything about it! The indie style, the atmosphere and feeling of the early 1990’s working class USA, the great group of starring actors, the hardhitting boxing, the screenplay…"", ""The result is not perfect – what is, anyway? – and one could nitpick about many things if wanted to. For example, the movie runs near two hours which is not exactly a short amount of time… but one does not get a good sense of Vinny Paz’s development as a champion sportsman, or even exactly how the recovery from the big accident went. Of course, it’s all explained in passing, but it doesn’t satisfy to the fullest."", ""Maybe it’s just me because I enjoyed visiting Vinny’s world, family and environment so much that I left the cinema wanting more. „Bleed for This“ is one of those rather uncommon sports movies that is not afraid to let characters and story breathe and develop enough to lure us in, to make us want really be there for the characters, not just flashy action."", ""This kind of intimate connection to the movie mostly happens when its makers have strong personal connection with the whole thing too.

For most of the current decade, he has been doing boring commercial crap which is a world away from the works that made him known in the first place. Here he seems to channel a younger less fat version of James Gandolfini which is enough for me to wish him a Supporting Actor Oscar, or at least a nomination. And last but certainly not the least, „Bleed for This“ cements Miles Teller’s position as one of the most promising young American movie actors of his generation. You almost remember him from big studio projects „Divergent“ + „Insurgent“ and 2015’s „Fantastic Four“ but he has also starred in a row of cool indie-er movies such as „The Spectacular Now“ and „Whiplash“. The former quirky cool guy has transformed himself for the never-surrender-type boxer role but manages to turn what on paper seems like a cartoon character into living breathing human being. He should also get nominated for Oscar."", ""\""Bleed for This\"" doesn't offer a biggest amount of boxing I have seen in a boxing movie.

Because of that the picture is constructed within three worlds, the horrible present (the movie), the repressed past (in flashbacks) and the fantastic other reality (breaking the flashbacks). That is why especial technical aspects are used to narrate the story, like slow motion shots, changes in illumination and audio-visual counterpoint (when in a fight it sounds quiet music). Another captivating thing is the evolution of the protagonist in the story, showing that is possible to take every little thing that happen to you, without mattering if is either good or bad, and learn something about it, because things happen for a reason.  Lee Daniels definitely made a masterpiece, the screenplay is astonishing and the performance of the cast is amazing.

It is a virtual descent into hell and back again for the viewer, though nowhere near as persistently hellish as Passion of Christ, as the movie follows the main character while he tries to escape the clutches of the deranged Mayan soldiery. All of it is done using Mayan language, which adds quite a lot of believability to the entire thing. Historically though, the proceedings are a sort of mix between Mayan and Aztec culture, and deliberately so, for reasons I`ll get to."", ""As always I feel myself compelled to use Metacritic to point out allegories in movies, because nobody else is apparently able to notice them. And particularly the \""this isn`t historically accurate\"" people, who have missed every single point about both Passion of Christ and Apocalypto. The reason Gibson used a composite for the imperial culture in Apocalypto is precisely to make it obvious that the movie is not intended to be a docudrama but an allegory of the conflict between power and empire on one side and freedom and natural humanity on the other. It is expected that the viewer notices these simple things to be able to also notice that the entire religious ceremony through which the Mayan elite exercises its power is a farce, a pantomime and a gigantic fraud, and that they all know it up on top of the pyramid, while the subjects down below do not. The whole thing is nothing more than a staged performance of state organized brutality, intended to frighten the peasants."", ""This is the main statement Gibson makes in Apocalypto: that power is a fraud, maintained only through terrorizing the people. But because he is not really talking about Mayas, but about our present western power elite, he distorts it by mixing Aztec and Mayan culture. And this is what should tell us that the movie is a political, philosophical allegory about imperialism and oligarchy, which is not intended to be viewed as a period piece or anything of the sort. Otherwise he would not have blended the cultures see? Like Passion of Christ, Apocalypto tries to deal with the hypocrisy and mass murder at the heart of western civilization, with illegitimate power elites suppressing humanity, justice, freedom and truth, by using lies and violence in order to perpetuate their power. It presents a view on the evils of government as organized violence against the inherent good of man in his natural state. Once you truly understand this you`ll figure out that neither of these two movies are strictly about the subject matters, but are far more profound than that. So that`s why these \""historical inaccuracies that might confuse people\"" are in the movie, and not because \""Gibson doesn`t know how to read a history book\""."", """", ""Apocalypto is an allegory of contemporary oligarchical nonsense like the \""War on Terror\"", the \""War on Drugs\"", and an endless barrage of equally contrived and fake things. In fact, it is an allegory of any rule by lies, fraud, violence, intimidation and public spectacle and above all it is an allegory of good and evil. But if Mel Gibson had made this movie without allegories, he would probably have been shot by the CIA or been sent off to an insane asylum like Hemingway and Pound were. So much for free speech in the United States, and allegories it is then! Too bad most of the public are deaf dumb and blind to those. Oh well, what can you do, apart from whine about it on Metacritic?"", """", ""I`m done with my rant now. Go watch Apocalypto at once if you haven`t already. Mass stupidity must be resisted!"" ]"

For the most part, the documentary delivered, but in a typical way, following the trials and tribulations of three competition lindyhoppers who teach for a living, along with a few other stories. The tale of the three competitors was engrossing, but severely overdrawn during the 90 min of the film.  There was no mention the history and origins of the dance, other than a tree of life and the dance's start in the Savoy Ballroom.  It did highlight Frankie Manning and Norma Miller, and it's current status of the dance.  No other giants of Lindyhop from the 1930's, nor the bands and the music that influenced the dance, were noted.  The focus was clearly on competition, although 95% of the dancers are not competitors.  It would have been interesting to highlight them more.  The international aspect was mentioned, as was the fact that there is little or no Black participation in the dance any longer. The short segment on Blues dancing was misguided.  Lindyhoppers do not form the core of Blues Dancers and generally do not participate in their weekly events or competitions. Although the video is drawn out, it did hold my attention."" ]"

Things immediately flagged in the second act, which shifted focus almost exclusively to Mark Wahlberg, a despicable human being who I have a hard time watching in anything. A violent and repeat criminal who blinded a man in one eye in a vicious attack. Why is this guy not in prison? He also just doesn't have charisma the way movie stars should. Do women find him sexy? If so, I don't know why. Charlize Theron played an uninteresting character cliche, and for a woman who looks incredibly sexy in still photos, she was somehow utterly unsexy in motion here. It was as if she didn't care, but was just reading lines. I know she can act, but here she just had no intensity and no passion, no charisma. I just couldn't maintain my interest and stopped watching about 40 minutes in. Listen, maybe the movie got great the second after I turned it off, but one has to make decisions based on the information one has. The information I had told me I was wasting my time. Someone needs to make a movie starring Donald Sutherland again, rather than just using him as a minor supporting player. That guy knows what he's doing."" ]"
unfaithful;8;6;NikolayG;"[ ""I'm partial to thrillers that focus on couples, and enjoyed this a great deal. The acting is perfect. The story didn't know if it wanted to be straight drama, or a thriller. It's about a woman who has an affair and the growing suspicion of her husband. I wish the traditional thriller qualities had entered the story a lot sooner, so much more could have been done with that. But just the same, I was totally involved from the start all the way through to the end. Though I would have handled the ending differently. This is not a spoiler because this does not happen in the movie. But at the end the main characters - the married couple - is in a car at night. They are having a very significant moment. There is a train crossing just ahead. That much IS in the movie. For my money - given the shady activities they have both been engaged in - I would have had them drive across the tracks only to get whacked and obliterated by a high speed train. Then black screen and credits while the train whistle blows. But that didn't happen. The actual ending is good, though. Just not as good as that. While it's true that the movie has intense sex scenes, in the end you realize - other than toplessness - they really don't show anything you wouldn't see on the average beach, and all those scenes combined occupy maybe 4 minutes of screen time out of two hours. So reviewers who are calling this porn are just factually incorrect."" ]"

It's pretty good, in a weird way, until the last act where it goes very over the top and introduces a super high concept twist, which is just off the wall. And the final scene makes no sense at all. At the end, the protagonist wants to stop someone, but the action he takes would not stop the events he wants to stop. It's too late. Yet he acts as if it isn't. It's just nonsensical.

First, there's just not enough Michael Douglas. I don't know why movie studios think we don't want to continue to watch our beloved stars as they age.

The second problem is, they throw in an absurd double backflip of a twist in the final scene that is so unbelievable you just have to pretend it never happened. There was a period from about 2005 until just a couple of years ago, when every thriller had to throw in a ridiculous extra super twist at the very end. They always ruined the story but thankfully these days they don't seem to be doing that anymore. Beyond A Reasonable Doubt fell right smack dab in the midst of that silly trend."", """", ""Basically, the plot (without giving away more than a trailer would) is about a journalist who has a hunch that a successful prosecutor is planting DNA evidence in every case he tries, to win a conviction, and the journalist sets out to prove it.

The pc complaints that she is somehow donning \""black face\"" because her skin was darkened and features altered for the role, is absurd. Black face is designed to mock black people. It's supposed to look fake. The efforts the filmmakers went to to make Zoe appear more like her subject is not unlike similar efforts implemented in any number of other films, such as some starring Daniel Day-Lewis. People who simply wanted an actress who was a carbon copy of what Nina Simone looked like on the outside without regard to acting ability or - and this is most critical - singing ability, are being frankly ridiculous, and those who cry racism should be ashamed of themselves. It would have been likely impossible to get anyone other than Zoe fit for this role in both singing and acting ability. To use Nina's own tracks would have been too fake and unnatural stuck into an actress's mouth like some old 50s musical. Zoe had the guts to go for this and luckily, incredibly, the voice to pull it off. If you have any interest in Zoe or Nina Simone you should watch this movie. It follows Nina Simone in the 1990s as she's trying to recover from her abuse of alcohol and her other issues, to make a comeback, incorporating several flashbacks from her younger years. A fascinating portrait."" ]"

I have already seen a few similar themed films from other parts of the world, particularly in Hollywood. But none of them were as serious as this one while narrating its tale. The storyline was simple, entirely focused on a family, fighting on stumbling marriage. It was a long introduction, particularly aimed at a father, like how he messed up in his life with gambling.

It was adapted several times for the screen, but this is the latest and a modernised version. The first film for the director and he was amazing in handling the screenplay as well. Obviously I did not know anything about the film. The cast looked good and also the storyline, so that's my reason to watch it. It began like a simple drama about a family who are going through a difficult time after the wood mill was shut down in their small town. Their's daughter, Hedvig, who is studying in the high school worries that she's going to lose her boyfriend if they move out of the town.

From all this, the daughter is the one who directly get affected, but to learn how is why you should watch this film."", ""You won't immediately understand the meaning of the title. The film very smartly progresses like bit by bit with lots of suspense around. The best part is, it never reveals the actual secret at any length of the film, but still the viewers going understand the situation very clearly. That's really amazing, particularly the writing being so clever. I don't know the original material which is more than a hundred year old, but I loved this to tell the story in a smart way."", ""\""You do not need to be scared of the truth.\"""", ""The characters were the best part of the story. The switching time was excellently done. Like the whole film is not intended to deal with one particular issue, but multiple. Everybody had something to deal with, some were personal and some were concerned for their whole family. The story always engaged with details, so there's no time for relaxation for the viewers. In the first half it succeeds to keep everything neat, despite the story developed from different angles. Because the end pulls them all together to conclude the tale on high. High mean, neither happy or sad, the timing when the twist takes place was a perfect setting."", ""If you are a melodrama fan, this must not be missed. I haven't seen a good tearjerker for a long time and then I found this one unexpectedly. I did not know the film would turn this way, but that's one of the reasons why I liked it a lot. The twist at the final act was kind of predictable if you were focused enough in the early part, but nobody gets a clear picture of how it all ends. That's the point. Despite how the film characters react when the suspense was revealed, we have our own respond too, but unable to deliver where it requires. That is funny, but the film gets very serious towards the final segment and you get no time to react, you will be like unmoved till the end credits roll up. But sensing a tragedy is certain."", ""I recently saw 'Fathers & Daughter', that I anticipated something what this film offered. The story lines are completely different from these two films, but that father and daughter relationship thing, I liked very much from this one. Especially the emotions are the most crucial to narrate the tale and this film was way better in that perspective. Comparison between these two titles only on the sentimental side, other than that it's not fair to bring a debate on them. Anyway, both are the fine melodrama."", ""This film definitely would appeal strongly to the family audience and I highly recommend it to them. There's no strong nudity or the sex scenes, but thematically it goes some length to record the required event. Other than those couple of parts, this is a film for everybody. Very satisfied with the overall film. I might not consider it my favourite, but very close to be called one. Like I said the story was thoroughly written, so I'm feeling this film won't go unnoticed. I am not talking about it would find its audience, but the remakes. European, Korean, Bollywood, even a Hollywood version might come.

But this film was much, much better than it had been rated in the internet. The story, the main event starts without wasting any time. There's no initial developments like intros. When the thriller-adventure parts commences, reveals everything you have to know."", ""Just over 2 hours long, the story frequently switches back and forth to where a man got trapped in a collapsed tunnel road and the outside where people and rescue team gathered. Like any other similar themed film, it borrowed a handful of clichés, but still you can witness the effort for the avoidance. Like if you see something or someone's crucial part come into play, usually you would predict what might happen to it in the later part of the story. Since those are unavoidable, they simply skipped in the final act as it is understandable and not to waste developing them to some extent."", ""So a man is fighting for his survival after a disaster strikes. But he got a cell phone signal buried under a deep mountain that I could not get. Anyway, he does make know his state of condition to the outside world. Soon they all rally to get him out.

Kind of reminded me 'Peepli (Live)', about the media circus in such situation. But that is the truth, what todays media have become, because of competition among themselves."", ""?Don't be weak and say you'll die, just live.?"", ""The trapped man has to make sure about food and water to survive till the rescue team reaches him down which could take a week or more. Yeah, they kind of mention the recent Chile event which was made into the film, 'The 33'. His portion of the story is like the combination of '127 Hours', 'Buried' and of course that Chilean film. There are lots of things happen, you could say twists and turns. Kind of too much at some point, the way they added more contents to it, but decently it all worked out."", ""Meanwhile, on the outside world, not lags behind. It has its own set of characters and its circumstance events. Lots of fun and also highlights wrongs. Particularly like I said, the media and how politicians make use of such incident for publicity. And the final one about the construction firms and their shoddy works for profits. They have dug on these topics, but did not go deeper, because to keep it lighter and entertaining film than all about awareness."", ""All the way an engaging narrative. Means a long film, but very swiftly told story. Visually, it was a well made film, like everything's looked natural and believable. You could not differentiate the CGI/green screen work and the real objects of those disaster parts. But not the technical details such as drilling or the hollow space where he stays alive. When the narration progresses, it gets even worse, like you would say how could that even possible or just they wanted it that way to end the tale."", ""A small part of the end kind of skips, but that's good for the film than dragging it for another half an hour. The casting was good, they all performed well, but my favourite was Oh Dal-su. As usual, I loved his part, one of the finest supporting characters in the world cinema. It's not a great film, but good, and acceptable as what it is. In the end feels like worth it. So I decided to suggest it for those who are interested, but could not decide whether to go for it or not, and for the Korean film fans outside the Korea."", ""7.5/10"" ]"

Because literally UN is the US."", ""It all began with his little speech at the 2016 Oscars. Then I did not realise, but after watching this, everything makes sense. Anyway, he was average, he just toured the world and did what asked for, the rest of the job done by the film crew, but the film and its message certainly not neglactable. So my appreciation goes to the writer, director and the production house."", ""Okay, let's talk about the film. It is not just an important film, but a very, very important film. So they made sure it to easily accessible by everyone around the world in different platform. Some people are encouraged when they watch films like this, but soon after they go to their regular thing. We do not need that kind of attitude here, because it is already late and we can't reverse the damages that's already been done, though it can be prevented from happening further. Like I said in my 'Racing Extiction' review, a small contribution by everyone matters a lot."", ""The actor who is appointed as the United Nations 'Messenger of Peace' is set to travel the world for three years to observe and collect the information about the impact of man made global warming. Actually, he never asked any genuine question to whom he's interviewing for this documentary, like they are maybe the experts, scientists or the leaders around the world. But the goal was covered, even if it was a small amount. Because the first thing you have to understand about this film is, unlike any similar climate change documentaries, this did not try hard to give a complete picture on its topic. It was just an observation and its report kind of film by an actor who was chosen by the UN."", ""\""If you consider this vastness of this universe, this planet earth is just a small boat.

We had seen all the debates in the previous documentaries, but the perspectives were different with the same message, I mean the warning. Because it does not stop here, if we does not change and the message is going to be very louder and louder every time. What the actor saw through his own eyes on his journey were the separate incidents/disasters from different parts of the world what we had seen in a single film like '2012'. And who knows, that kind of collapse might go to happen as well in a near future if we don't act today."", ""The common line from all these documentaries are 'the global warming is real and it's happening right now'. But to whom it is said? For every person, the citizens of the earth, including you and me. I liked what in this film they pointed out, that the leaders listens people who voted them. Because they say only what we wanted to listen. So if we pressure them, they will fall in line. And this thing is badly needed to come to effect in the United States. If the America change their attitude, so the world would, because that's what had followed in the 21st century. But it seems they are lagging behind compared to the Baltic countries who are going fossil fuel- free nations."", ""This film's title referred as from the bible, like Noah's ark story. So do we need one if the polar ices completely meltdown? The answers is a big YES. Like the one that we saw in the film '2012'. Not for the whole world, but for those poor little island inhabitants.

Don't think it is the government or the corporate's job, we all have our part to contribute and yes, it is so tiny, but the result will be enormous when we saw it together with everyone's contribution. Just watching a film like this is no use, we need to educate around us, especially for those has no opportunity to watch them or unable to understand them.

I had a misconception during my childhood that all tribal people, mostly from the deep jungles are so cruel just like the North Sentinel Island people. I never visited such place or met such people, but some documentaries and feature films taught me many things. This is one of those films to highlight them and their culture."", ""The people from the Tanna island rejected to adopt the outside culture just to save theirs, which is used to be thousands of years old. Everything was taught to their kids, from hunting and gathering to the growing fruits, vegetables and livestocks.

This film was a romance-drama, when the young couple's love was rejected by their elders, how they fought for it, which forced to bring a reform in their custom was told."", ""This is like the Vanuatu's version of Romeo-Juliet tale. While watching it, my heart was pounding faster. Because since I don't know these people and their traditions, I thought something terrible going to happen sooner or later.

It was an advantage for the filmmakers, like they were making a documentary, despite they wrote the screenplay for it. Everyone played their own real life character to depict the actual event. Particularly the lead ones, Dain, Wawa, Selin and a few others were impressive. Awesome cinematography, as well as background score. The locations were amazing, including that live volcanic mountain. Despite their presence in the region for centuries, it looks untouched and wild."", ""This film is what something you won't see in your daily life. It was not a romance like in our society, but men and women falling in love in any culture/society are the same. The film was not entirely a love tale, but step by step it gets there. In the initial parts, it was an introduction to their customs with a little fun. Followed by revealing they are not alone. Then comes the turn in the story where the remaining parts have a new fast paced thrill look."", ""My point is we have seen hundreds of romance films, but this is one of those rare ones where 90 per cent of the world never going to meet these real people in their lives.

A great achievement, especially recognising such film by the Australian film society, as well as the Academy juries for nominating it."", ""I'll be looking forward and cheering for them on their red carpet appearance.

But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents."", ""Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises."", ""The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko."", ""?So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.?"", ""So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story."", ""But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part."", ""The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book."", ""Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!"", ""8/10"" ]"

First of all I did not know John Krasinski directs films. In fact, this is his second feature film, the only one I have seen and I loved it. The main reason to I enjoy it was, it is sentimental. Not just some foolish melodrama, but an uplifting film filled with lots of fun."", ""The cast was at its best. I liked everyone and their unique display. At some point it feels like a realistic drama, but those comedies make us realise that it's only a film. Margo Martindale was really awesome. I have never seen her in such a wonderful role. Most importantly in an important role like this one. If I remember this film in the future, that's only for her. The only negative about the film was the twist. It was like they aimed for it to bring change in pace and atmosphere, when the situation in the story was not in its favour. Even though I did not care it, and thoroughly enjoyed it."", ""This is the story of the Hollar family who reunite when they needed for each other. When John comes to know his mother got ill, he immediately flies back home. His brother is already there and the father is financially struggling. With many struggles, they all prepare for the medical procedure. In the meantime, there are some outside adventures. Like meeting their old friends, places, ex-wife et cetera. The remaining of the film is to reveal how it all goes and where they will stand."", ""The target audience is mainly the families. If you like a tearjerker, you would enjoy watching it as well. So in my opinion, this film is under-rated and under-noticed. Mainly because of the cast is not so popular and so the lack of promotion. Even the film poster is not that impressive. Kind of looks like a B movie and of course it is, but an awesome B movie. Worth a watch for many reasons and you will know it when you give it a try. So, recommended."", ""8/10"" ]"

This film is not about that, but there's a reason to I bring that up in here."", ""This film is about a boy named Owen Suskind, who developed autism at the age of 3. Since then the journey of his life has been very hard, especially for his family who had tried to understand and find a solution for it. But until at one stage of his childhood, after years of observation, they have found a way to connect with their lost son in his own world as the way he desired to meet/accept them at last."", ""It was not the permanent cure they have been looking for, but it enabled an access to what so far we had struggled to make that kind of progress. All we common people know is that autistic people are sensitive, but genius or mastered in one particular thing they love the most. There's a pattern, and we have to jump in onto it to clear the way to bring both the worlds together. This had been done in the past, so in the present, but this film gives a new perspective to learn new methods."", ""This is not some medical achievement, but the desperate Owen's family found a way. That's a lovely family, they never gave up on him. His big brother as well, trying to teach the grownup's form of love was honest and realistic. Beyond that, his plan for their future together, which eventually one day would come. I know that some of the scenes were recreated from the Owen's life, just for this documentary film. Particularly, I was impressed by the romance parts which reminded me 'Gabrielle'. But hearbreaking at certain satge."", ""?I created a story about sidekicks searching for a hero in my head, and I called it 'The Land of the Lost Sidekicks'.?"", ""I don't know who did the animation for this, but I loved it all. They used them to narrate the tale very beautifully. There are many fans in the world who love the sidekicks from their favourite films/animations. Even sometimes, I love them more than the film's heroes. If you do as well, try this, but this film is not about them and they were mostly the blurred animation version. Or you can say, except the film clips, the remaining original animations were simple sketch and acceptable quality."", ""In reality, I don't know the whole life story of Owen, but according to this film, what I learnt, I truly admire his father Ron. He's lucky to have such a father. This film was based on the book he wrote of the same name. And the whole family's effort given a new life to Owen. This film is nominated for the Oscars in the Best Documentary Feature list. But I'm not sure it'll win. Anyway a big thanks to the filmmakers to bring this up."", ""I know Disney is aware of this film since they allowed their contents to use in it. They can make a feature film out of it, a neat biopic. That would be a great honour for such a big fan of their works. But I'm particularly interested in the Owen's vision about his 'The Land of the Lost Sidekicks'. It's nothing less than the Marvel's 'The Avengers', but for the kids and for the fans of Disney's 2D animations like me from the pre 2000."", ""This film is not under-appreciated, but under-recognised as of now. So I hope you put this into your watch list. It is a good family film, a message in it. We're surrounded by all kinds of people, so it does not matter if the film is not for us, at least you will learn something out of it. That's the any documentary film's notion, as always.

The promotion begins from the day it was announced. So I did not realise when this one started to come to exist. But when I did come to know, all I know was it is an Eddie Murphy's film and I should give it a try. Because I felt like I haven't seen him for a decade."", ""After watching it, I totally stunned and asked myself is this the same Eddie we used to enjoy his comedies? Yep, but no. I mean the guy was the same, but I saw completely a new of him as an actor. He definitely chose a best script and this is the break he was looking for all these years. Initially Samuel L. Jackson was considered for the lead role, later replaced by him. I won't be surprised if he gets the Oscar nomination for the role he played. I don't care whether it is for a lead or supporting role, but I'll be very happy for the nod. And I also won't care if he wins or not, but this film and his role will remain special to me forever."", ""So what this film is about? It was the story of Charlie Brooks, a woman who recalls her memories of the life she spent together with a man called Church since she was a ten year old. It all begins when one day after waking up in the morning to find a stranger in her kitchen, Then she learns that he's their new cook assigned by her mother's ex-boyfriend. She initially hates him, but it does not remain the same way when time passes by. That's what this tale is going to reveal how far he remain in her family to help her ill mother. All the following events very beautifully told."", ""What I'm surprised the most was, it is not based on any book. Thanks for that, because usually the book fans attack such move. Like they usually say the adaptation to the screen is ruined the original material. Anyway, I'm film guy, I like books turned into the films, because I'm lazy to read them. But it was inspired by the real friendship, that's what the opening statement says. Which was actually from the writer's real life, though I believe many parts were altered and the new stuffs included. I'm sure I won't find another film like this any time soon, so maybe I would re-watch it."", ""\""It's an awful feeling to love someone so much that you absolutely hate them for leaving you.\"""", ""It has been a very long time since I have given a maximum score for a film. When I started to watch it, I did not think it would be the one, but it deserved that honour. The main reason was to I love it, it has no clichés, I mean almost 90 per cent free from them. The first thing was, I though it is a food film and then it turned that down with only required amount of those contents keeping in its narration. Followed by I thought it could turn into a romance, but once again that theme as well sidelined to focus on the different event, I mean the series of events."", ""So now you might be confused what I am blabbering. Actually, this is the story of a ten year old girl till she reach her middle age and during that period of time, about a man who entered her life and stayed very close despite each other never revealed their personal life. Her school graduate and college days, followed by many events of her personal life as similar to the Mr. Church's life events at the same time, the film only concentrated the unusual relationship between them. So there's nothing wrong to call it another version of 'Driving Miss Daisy'. In fact, it was made by the same director."", ""Like I said, Eddie Murphy nailed his part. I hope he does more serious films like this and according to his age. I think this is what Adam Sandler should follow as well. The entire story was told from the Charlie's perspective that payed by the young sensation Britt Robertson. She was good as the Eddie, but her character was not designed to highlight the film, instead her character highlights Eddie's Mr. Church. She only reveals what she saw with her own eyes about the person she respects, despite it all began with a simple dislike. Beside she never had a father, never knew who her father was, so the Mr. Church takes that place conveniently without their's knowledge."", ""A heartwarming drama for the whole family. I did not find any obscene parts. It is now in my all time favourites list. The length was perfect and the pace was excellent. There's no major twist, like that stuns you at the final stage, but there were many small twists and turns all along. The film critics got all wrong, like usual, they proved they got no brain. This is a inspiring film. You will learn how to respect people around us, who respect us. Like cooking, books, caring for each other, privacy, many fine topics were covered. So watching it with the youngsters and kids might boost their moral attitude. So I feel it is a perfect weekend family film. Highly, strongly recommended."", ""10/10"" ]"

Even though I'm not familiar with the original material I would say it was one of the best novel-to-screen translation I have seen. The long runtime has never been the issue, but slowly, solidly told tale. My only disappointment is that it was not in the Scottish language since it was about a Scottish family."", """", ""There were many Scottish dialects that I did not get at first, so I had to google them to know the meaning. But I liked it which reveals the true nature of the local culture. I meant it essential to narrate a tale in the native flavour to enhance the richness in its contents.

If you manage to survive in the first half, then you can easily get through in the remaining by liking it a lot. It was nothing like we know the story or we don't, it was simply about the twist and turns of somebody's life just like ours, except it was from a different timeline. Precisely to say the phases of life is what this film is all about. Like shifting the gear in the car, according to the condition of the road and the destination.

When the time comes, there's no one can stand and help.\"""", """", ""It was totally an unexpected film, kind of reminded me 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Love Comes Softly'. Focused mainly on a woman, in the men dominated world. It was not just a rural theme, but also sometimes takes us beyond to other topics. Like during the first world war and under the English dominated UK, how the Scots lost the rights and their culture disappeared. No doubt why Scots are asking for their own nation."", """", ""The romance was another turning point in the story, like raising strong from the fall. After seeing lots of similar changes, I was unable to predict what conclusion may come. But it was strong and intentional with some wonderful dialogues. I loved the beautiful landscapes from the different seasons. It was actually shot in the New Zealand, Scottland and Luxembarough. There's no expansion in the locations, mainly it sets in and around a farmhouse and very occasionally other than these parts."", """", ""The one in the Chris' shoe was amazing. Like usual, Peter Mullan was fantastic and similarly others as well in their short stay. As the story progress, consequently the film characters reshuffled. Even for us, the main character Chris is like crossing through a juncture from the coming-of-age to self-discovery. Displaying the transformation of Chris from a certain period of time was the film's great achievement. Like how a landscape change from the dawn to dust, this woman's life sees the same fate. That's what the title implies."", """", ""I don't know this British director, but this film opened a new door to me further to check it out his other works.

As to what this film talks, the law was not written in a single day and some of them are overlaps with traditional culture which definitely need a serious reconsideration. It keeps changing until finding a correct solution. Take our society as an example, now the homosexual and marijuana laws were getting friendlier than ever.

The conclusion was very emotional, especially the lines Hirut said was reflected what she went through and might going repeat for other girls."", """", ""This is highly recommended by me. This film needs viewers, to learn what's really happening out there. Especially in a male dominated society, how the children and women are coping to stand on their own feet.

His story is kind of depressing. Not the film, just what he went through in his life and after that his life remained quite a low without an alternative. Though, there were no flashbacks, but just revealed by orally when the right time comes."", """", ""One day a very old woman named Tokue comes asking for a job after seeing the signboard outside the shop and somehow she manages to grab it. Later she teaches him to make his own bean paste. This is the part I like very much, because it might have not revealed fully how to make a bean paste, but definitely you would feel you want to taste it right away when you see the beautifully prepared paste filled in the tray. So I won't be surprised if you visit a Japanese restaurant just to make your first taste of dorayaki or whenever you visit there, remember this film and ask for it."", """", ""\""It's like a first date, the young couple needs to get friendly.\"""", """", ""So with such a development, the film takes a leap to the next stage of the story. Where the shop sees the rise in customer influx and by its success, Tokue offered to stay and help further. On the other side a middle school girl, Wakana who has not decided about her future, whether to attend the high school or get a job in Takue's shop which obviously went to the old woman. In the meantime, all the three develop a close relationship to each other in the short time. Despite from the different social group, but the strong connection with the shop. But one day as the gossip spreading like a wildfire all over the town about the shop, followed by a couple of unexpected events, the story nears to its end part with an emotional episode."", """", ""The most of the film looked like a poetry. The director, who also wrote the screenplay did an awesome job. The cast's performances were outstanding. I have seen them all in different films, even though I did not recognise them at first. I think it is the actors and the wonderful cinematography that made this film looks better than its story. People put their recipe in a book and publish them or make the videos and release online, but I think this kind of film is definitely would make lot impact on, even for the non-food lovers to have a close look which would generate a serious desire and hunger. Just like 'The Ramen Girl', but not as good as this one. A film that preserves a precious dish digitally and makes reach corners of the world."", """", ""By now you know that I loved it, but there's something I did not like from it which is the third act. Actually, that final act was a bit drag. Compared to the earlier sections, those last 20 or so minutes were quite an unnecessary stretch. I am an easy prey to sentimental scenes, but for this film I did not feel a thing. Other than that, how it all ended pretty neatly wrapped which I applaud loudly."", """", ""Whatever I said all the good and bad stuffs about it, there are some other topics as well in it which came as a side message, but that overtook everything on the final stage and ended as it was the centre of the story like that about treating an older person with disability. I had said many times before in my earlier reviews that I easily fall for seeing the old people suffering which happened in this. So heartbreaking. Except a very few defects that affected me which might won't make a big deal for others, I recommend the film, especially for the drama fans and food lovers."", """", ""8/10"" ]"

I regret that I was not able to watch this in digital 3D, other than that, this is a wonderful film for TMNT fans. I know, some people downgrading it, but don't believe them, it is just a fine film if not an awesome as I'm praising, particularly keeping in my mind the common people. So watch this for entertainment and it will deliver for sure."", """", ""There are some flaws, but I did not care about them, because it was not a documentary film or even a sci-fi film, it's just a fun-action film. So everything was aimed to bring laughs and it did successfully. If you go with science, then this is a nonsense film. Anyway, the vfx was very impressive, the CGI characters looked even better than the previous one. Don't compare it with the DC or Marvel's films, it is setting up its own trend. Like those new additions, Rhino and Warthog characters were seems more like reading a comic book, straight outta from the sketches."", """", ""Excellent follow-up and expecting another sequel in the next two years. The director of 'Earth to Echo' did a great job, and also all the actors. Little disappointed was the villain. I expected some strong confrontation between the heroes and the bad guys which was a let down. Though, all the stunt sequences were well designed. Those clichés like a mad scientist, alien invasion, hole in the sky et cetera, did not stop me from having a good time. Surely I would watch it one more time, just for entertainment, that's what this film is good at. I suggest you as well to watch it if you're seeking the same."", """", ""8/10"" ]"

All these were narrated very funnily, and sometime the fact of the war takes some of the scenes to the serious."", """", ""Like I said I enjoyed it a lot, and I believe it is capable to pull out another film to follow. Yep, like I always say when I like a film, I won't say no for a sequel to this. Because what the film characters accomplished in the end of the narration has looked to me just a beginning of another adventure. It might mean the loop in the tale to end on a high note, yet give an opportunity for another possible venture. I have no idea about the book, but it sounds good to me and I'll pray for it to happen.

As I said earlier, the images talk more than the film characters. The music score was also very good. The overall film looks like a touch of the 60s or 70s, but there's no any clarifications about the timeline.

The film characters, the story, as well as production design was very simple. Like they did not spend much for making it. Yet it delivered big. Sadly, this is not a well recognised film, not much from LGBT film fanatic friends as well. I haven't seen many Lithuanian films, but surely this is one of the best from that region I have seen. You know who's the target audience for this, but the film is too good, so I hope you make a right choice.

Like it's their destiny to meet, they found each other."", """", ""After the initial stumble, they decide to meet every day at the same time. Their new relationship is not based on the thousands of years of the human civilization, but beyond that with the mutuals understanding. When the rules have broken, the cracks begin to appear and it all ends after a series of turns in the tale. Predictable conclusion, but very much suitable and highly standard."", """", ""\""Life is a collection of moments."", ""The idea is to have as many good ones as you can.\"""", """", ""Like most of the movies this one opened with a background narration about the situation of the man of the movie. Like how it all began, then in the first 15 minutes itself, there are many tiny twists on the line of development of the story carried on and introduces a few other characters along. But keeps the tidiness on one relationship throughout the movie and explores only a certain kind of atmosphere to focus everything on a single line."", """", ""If you don't believe in religion means not this is a celebratable movie for you or anyone who are like you. The contents were very sensitive, even for the atheists. It was a lot like the hippie culture, but only on the matter of the relationship, especially 'One life-One wife' angle. In some angles, it gives the assumption that it is a clash of two cultures. But I don't think that's a true, especially in the French perspective as the story takes place in NYC."", """", ""The movie is a debatable, but if you take the movie 'Hall Pass' on the account, this film's concept is not that apart. I have heard that in the rural China, the brothers marrying a same woman due to large gender imbalance in the country after one-child policy set by the communist party. So this is not a strange thing, at least for a few people. This film might be accepted merely on a certain the section of the audience, but it's only a matter of time to adapt and accepted by a large number. I don't know about the prostitutions, but definitely it will abolish cheating within the marriage."", """", ""It had a plenty of awesome lines. You know I collect the good ones from the movies I watch, so I had many pauses. It sentimentally strikes strongly, that means you can't wet your eyes, but can be felt in your deep heart. So romantically appealing beside the theme is uncomfortable for the current social lifestyle. The film is not about what's right and what's wrong, but giving commitment to the oath one has taken. Not to hurt anybody, even though you hurt by yourself from making a mistake."", """", ""But again, it's not either about mistakes, but respecting the individual's desire for what they think is keeping them happy. If you exclude religion from the social rule book, this film might make sense. I think this could be the film, the more it gets old and the future generation will think one of the advanced work regarding the lifestyle of that time."", """", ""Maybe this is an Anton Yelchin's best movie I have ever seen. Phenomenal performance along with the French actress who was so beautiful, especially her smiley expressions were what set a mood for the movie. Very handy supporting cameos by a couple of senior artists. I wanted Alivia Thirlby to stay longer, but she was another cameo like supporting character. Anyway, good to see her after a long time, though 'Dredd' came just a couple of years ago."", """", ""Like I mentioned, people see it with their own perspective on what they believe in. Does not matter what you believe in, but all I'm saying is it is a wonderful movie, so please keep aside your differences and watch it. Youngsters might show more interest in this than the old people, mainly, because in the last 50 years cultural lifestyle took a long leap forward by modernising and free to express."", """", ""There won't be any issue if you consider it a simple, but the atypical entertainment movie like hundred of others. Remember, it is a dark comedy as well, so often it filled with some fun scenes. I felt it was almost a masterpiece, but the fact is it is not, for being a non-traditional romantic drama is the reason behind to my consideration. Still, it is a must see film and I won't refuse that."" ]"

So what bothered me was the film contents, because the trailed roughly reveals what kind of movie it is, from that I reckoned it should have been a big production house's product. Hence, I believed the visuals could be disastrous, but that was not the case. In fact, it was a remarkable standard, one of the reasons for the movie's success, despite there are no list-A actors in the full fledged roles."", """", ""The boy was much better in the movie than I judged his performance in the trailer. He might have appeared in a few television episodes, but this was his silver-screen debut. A wonderful display and I believe he would bag more projects for this.

Takes place in a small western coastal town called O'Hare about a 7 year old boy Pepper, nicknamed Little Boy who's willing to do anything to bring back his father alive from the war.

Like I said the graphics were very crucial that matched to any big budget films, unfortunately it was a small portion, but definitely a big deal. It talks about lots of interesting stuff which is inspiring, partially funny and also a children friendly film. Especially it explains quite clearly the difference between religious beliefs and magics which is obviously little kids never understood. So it could help to learn something from other than the textbooks."", """", ""The plus points were the consequences of war (any war), how the people can get affected by the war, bullying, racism and misbelief. On the other hand the minus was too much ingredient in a little movie, fortunately clicked so well. As usual, it was knocked down by the critics who never recognised the art of sentimental works. If you are not one of them or their followers, you are going to enjoy it."", """", ""If it had some big names in the main cast, especially for the father and brother characters, then it would have been roared louder and helped the international markets. As being one of the finest storied movie that highlighted our past mistakes, sadly terribly failed at the box office, but very much could get a cult status because particularly families loved this one so far.

Because sci-fi applies theoretical probabilities, animal psychology et cetera, while fairytale is a magic. It will come between sci-fi and fantasy, most likely an adult version of the fantasy tale. Comparing it with 'Birds' is one hundred per cent not agreeable, because unlike the dogs, the birds' behaviours were unknown. But 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' was the closest one, and you can compare Caesar with Hagen."", """", ""It does not end there, I believe you all have seen the last year's genuinely written screenplay 'Lucy'. You may wonder why this comparison, because this film is about dogs, yet the title strangely pronounced as 'God'. What I understood was that Hagen was drugged with cocaine (white powder) like the blue powder in the other film and he started to change his personality. So that explains the coke was the 'White God' and the rest follows the story of revenge, leadership and ultimately the revolution."", """", ""\""It's hard to lose someone you love."", ""Things don't work out the way we imagined.\"""", """", ""Off the record: Most of us know that the dogs are derived from the wolves. Yet they have lost the freedom compared to a few centuries ago who walked freely on the human streets. Every dog must have a master/owner or it will be put to sleep rather keeping and feeding them forever in the dog pound. So I think dogs are suffering more than the apes and they deserved the revolution (according to this film)."", """", ""Animal abuse was highlighted in the movie. The story was descended from there and what happens if they takeover us is the movie's view. One of the weirdest movie of the year, but different and good. If you ever had a dog, you will know they were adorable, even in the violent scenes. Because they were just playing, but that does not the case for children and those who never been with dogs. Every shot that had dogs were cleverly achieved, the outcome was very convincing."", """", ""I have heard the crew used two brothers for the Hagen role. They both were awesome, equals to any main human characters from the movie. Another 250 mixed-breed stray dogs were participated in the film making and later most of them were adopted. Believe me the movie was a good one, but some people had a hard time accepting the oddity of the theme. It won a couple of awards at Cannes film festival, including one for the Hagen's character performance."", """", ""The Hungarian film industry to make into the international level, they should take the cue from this success and must bring the sequel with a broader cast. Nowadays, experimental movies like this are welcomed by the moviegoers around the globe.

The story that happened between the particular timeline was repeated again and again with another character's perspective and with different camera angles till truth reveals in the final chapter. As it's still developing the opening was confusing which was the first chapter. Without holding-up in development, it straight goes with the main intention of the theme. If you pass that then the following segments interest you to make you guess the possibilities the suspense it hold. Kind of impossible to predict because of the introduction of the related characters to the particular incident consumed by the three quarters of the film. Which mean twist comes at the latter part which was really a good one. Each character that comes in the different episodes were incredible. Like, for a moment it was unhooked from the rest and centralizes that specific story stream, but the common event holds the story all together. I liked all the main characters, but the character Serena steals the final show. The role who played it was a new face and I kind see a great career ahead of her. (God, she's kind of attractive, hope its not me the only one to say that.) This was one of the recent best neo-noir. If somebody asks, I definitely recommend it."" ]"

Lots of scenes make no sense, and gives the impression of the girl is so dumb. Also leaves many unanswered questions behind which is the negative side of the narration.

Even he undergoes several life threatening situations and also meets his past (people) only to clear his head."", """", ""Hector was a very fond of Tintin comic books, he kind of imagines that he's Tintin and his dog as Snowy, but there's no confirmation in this regard in the movie. The adventure he takes exactly depicts what Tintin stories do. Looks his mood was kind of affect since his childhood. In the opening scene, he loses his dog which represented his 'Happiness'. Also, where the 'Unhappiness' (probably his girlfriend in his real world) rose above and tailed him since. These are simply my theory considering unexplained things or trying to crack down the hidden messages."", """", ""I won't deny that some of the ideas were borrowed from the other flicks. It might not be as fancy as 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', but it had some of its own great momentum like, laughs, craziness, emotions, romance and adventures. I have not seen Simon Pegg's all the movies, but in this he was never seen before avatar. I'll definitely remember it for him as long as I'll be in this film watching business. I was expecting his usual comedy, but I was absolutely blown away for witnessing an uplifting movie. If you focus deeply on the narration, you could virtually experience passing through all those provinces shown in the film. Definitely one of the top 10 films from the year 2014. I highly recommend it, certainly a must watch."", """", ""9/10"" ]"

About a small Toque Macaque kingdom established many generations ago in the rock castle surrounded by the ruined ancient temple."", """", ""Directed by the 'Chimpanzee' filmmakers, yet another stunningly presented primate genus creature that's specifically made for the little children like all the previous Disney Nature films.

Because I haven't seen documentary films about Pandas, so it will going to be a very exciting one for sure.

The supporting roles were not here to just support, but participated beyond the usual. Cara Delevingne was not bad either, but her part was like in and out frequently.

So the entertainment is guaranteed."", """", ""It is not just a romance between two, that is what I was surprised. The narration points out a one love story, but in the end you would end up watching a multiple romances.

One of the reason was, I could not get the film characters right due to complicated introductions.

In the second half, especially after the story moved to Korean, I get used to it and afterwards it was very smooth."", """", ""The other reason was obviously the length of the movie.

Beautifully written for the screen, except like I said the editing was confusing for the lack of proper inception. Don't think it's simply about the brave freedom fighters; betrayal, revenge, family, third person caught in, like that it had many stuffs. It is also very rare to see a woman fighter among them. All the action scenes were really well made, because that's the title isn't. The terrific settings of the 30s as well.

So mysterious and it stayed that way."", ""Shorter and well paced. This is definitely worth checking out, though not a must see. To learn the history, the bad one. I had no idea about it prior to watch, but at the end, I felt it accomplished everything on its capacity to give out the truth. No matter it is a documentary film, along with the suspense, the tension was well balanced. So, more or less it is same as like watching a regular crime film. That's especially for those who are not into documentary films. I hope someone would make a feature film out of it."", ""8/10"" ]"
heal-the-living;8;1;LeZee;"[ ""In the world of medical revolution."", ""Based on the novel of the same name, this French film was unique in many ways. Firstly, it was an awareness film. An awareness about the organ donations. In this medical revolution world, all we need is a little support. A support to our own species who are suffering. Not to waste our precious organs after the death. But it's not all about the deaths, the natural death. There are many reasons for death to happen, but not always the organs are the reason. So it can be transplanted to live on in another body, giving a chance of life. Sometimes, there were sentiments involved. Not because of the love and care shown to those particular persons by their family and friends, but because of unexpected event puts them into such position, where they all can only hope for something miracle."", ""It was like hundred minute long film, but for every 10-15 minutes, it changes focus from people to places and situations. So there's no one particular character the film to follow entirely. All were pieces of the individual's story that in a way connected. This surely a much need film. Because of the story design, especially being organ transplant/donation related theme, they wanted to avoid the emotions as much as possible. Since it's always happy at one side and sad on the other, which might discourage the idea of what this film trying to highlight."", ""A teenager who met with an accident in now treated in the hospital. But it is not a good news for his beloved ones. Literally, he's dead, though kept alive by machines. This is not those kind of coma, we have had seen in the films. The parents have to make a quick decision about what the doctors had suggested to them that is to donate the organs to whom needed them most. On the other side of the tale, a middle aged woman with heart trouble has her own opinion about heart transplant. But she needs to be there for her two young sons. In the meantime, with all the developments, the narration heads to the final segment, where tense moments arise till the final scene."", ""?Maybe my time has come. My heart will stop. That's nature.?"", ""I'm surprised that recently I've watched tons of films directed by women. It's really a good sign. Because stories from women's perspective can flourish in the coming generation, similar to the equal rights revolution happed a century ago in the western world. Considering that, it was a bit late to pick up the pace in filmdom. Not all the directresses make romantic or commercial chic films. Take Kathryn Bigelow as an example, she makes lots better men films than many male filmmakers today. This one was a gender neutral films. I've never seen other flicks from this maker, but seems she's young and very potential, that I want her to make a big entry into Hollywood as well."", ""The details in the film were astonishing. I usually not good at bloods. I avoid hospitals till it becomes a must. What I saw in the final quarter of the film was totally something. Like something I watched in a health channel. Of course it was staged, but very realistic presentation or you could say the demonstration was breathtaking. A few weeks ago in one of my reviews I've mentioned a doctor turned director made a film about his former profession. That was a simple rural based drama. The outside struggle. But this one, take us to the deep into the doctors' the other side of the world. I meant the surgery. I have seen many films like this, but none of them were edgy as this one. A perfect ending for such a film too."", ""So, the film might be a bit under-rated, but it was a much better film than many of the recent ones. It might be under-noticed, but that's because of lack of interest in such themed film among common people. Definitely not because of anything defect in the film. The critics have given thumbs up, so do I. But remember that the film has a story, not entirely about what mostly I've mentioned in most of other paragraphs. So expect less from it and be patience for its slow narration. There's nothing like what I've enjoyed you would enjoy it too. Just give it a try, it is totally worth."", ""8/10"" ]"

The story of two women and their unplanned journey to their unfinished businesses. Kind of self-discovery theme, but it gets a little crazy as what the title says. If you know Paolo Virzi and his films, then you know what to expect from it."", ""Well, it begins with when a new member Donatella at a mental institution was fooled by Beatrice, who was there for quite a some time. They might have differences, but have some unfinished affairs outside. An unlikely friendship blooms between them and one weekend, the situation favours them to get away. From there where their journey goes and how it all ends comes in the rest of the narration."", ""They both are not ill or the danger as they were institutionalised. Then why is what the film is going to narrate for us. Before that, it was initiated with a simple introduction of them and the situation they are in. It was really a good start, but then between the end of the first act and the beginning of the second was looked decent. Because that part was very familiar. You know, what do the people do when they runaway which were mostly wandering around and enjoying the freedom."", ""I thought it was a good film, not as I expected. Then, ever since the second half was on the roll, it got a lot better, in fact I started to love it. From a meaningless ride to something sensible topic, the narration comes to the point, what it was holding back in the earlier. Each woman's life revealed before to when this story had commenced. So the trip comes to an end when they do what's better for them and everybody around them. Kind of sad, though it concludes in a right way."", ""\""A mother's love is all giving, never expecting anything in return.\"""", ""The two lead actresses were amazing. Second back to back film for director with Valerina Bruni and she was even better than the previous film. Because the scope of her role was much bigger in this. I don't know I had seen her before, but Micaela Ramazotti was so good, by performance as well as glamorously. There's no way you could part them and say only one of them were good. I loved them both equally. Actually, that's how their characters were developed. The entire film was about them, and they left a mark to remember this film for them."", ""It's a good film, so I don't think it is an Oscar material as the Italian film board had already picked another film for that. But surely it going to win some international awards. If the same film was made in Hollywood, would have considered an average, because this one got the Italian flavour. The film gets crazy, in an Italian style, and in the perspective of the middle aged women. But it can enjoyed by everyone."", ""I have been watching a few good Italian films of the year, including this one. So I would definitely recommend it. Nearly two hours long, but the pace gets better while the story developed. Remember this is not the only kind, but one of the best among this theme you had ever seen. Ending the story with high emotional was so good, especially if you like that kind of material. I hope you won't miss it. Meanwhile, I'm so excited for the director who is making his first direct English language film. Looking forward to its release."", ""8/10"" ]"

While creating a film that is both very witty and incredibly sad, the director elaborates on what we know of Dickinson’s life and we feel as if we are living with her family and friends, partly through fact and partly through surmise. Although most of the film takes place in the Dickinson family home, the actors create a larger world (that includes the Civil War) and are totally convincing. If you love Dickinson’s poetry as I do, this is a “must see” film. Cynthia Nixon is astonishing."" ]"
he-never-died;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""He Never Died is a very original film about a very old theme (vampirism). Jack, played brilliantly by Henry Rollins, is reclusive, irritable, and very droll as he tries to stay away from humans, even though they are attracted to him (especially women) because he seems like a very nice, if very sad and introverted, guy. Jack is a “realistic” vampire who is not at all like the aggressive vampires as played by Bela Lugosi, but rather a kind of tragic hero, condemned to his fate of immortality and his need to feed on human blood. He is exasperated, trapped, and weary, trying to do the best he can in a \""difficult\"" situation. Henry Rollins is excellent, as is the direction and script. I thoroughly enjoyed this film."" ]"

What I particularly noticed is its tightness -- things happen quickly and inevitably. I also admired again the performance of Jonathan Rhys-Myers who with his slight sneer and silent watchfulness rivals Joseph Cotten in Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. Is the business about luck contrived? I am not sure, but I wish Allen would do a sequel. I would guess the JR-M character becomes a ruthless CEO (perhaps the Jeremy Irons character in Margin Call) and as he climbs, has a more willing string of mistresses. And perhaps he finds his father-in-law and he are more alike than we originally think or if not, and his father-in-law is indeed weak and rich by chance, the sky is the limit for JR-M -- until his luck runs out, that is. This is one of Allen's best."" ]"
the-forest;9;1;GinaK;"[ ""I enjoyed this film, and I don’t understand why it got such terrible reviews. One of my fellow user reviewers was absolutely right (after giving it a 10) – it is “mental scary” and not “horror scary.” What I would say is that it is psychological horror (that is, something like Hitchcock’s Psycho – the horror is Norman’s mind) instead of “place-based” horror such in Insidious. In some great horror films like The Haunting of Hill House, both types of horror appear – one of the characters is deranged but the house is also haunted. In The Forest, I thought the situation was interesting, the actors, especially Natalie Dormer (who seemed to get a good review no matter how much a professional critic hated the film), the locale was fresh and interesting, and the pace and direction was very good. To me the reviews of this film are another example of critics disdaining the horror genre simply because they don’t understand it."" ]"

It's an interesting story, told with good humor, although the storyline is not very clear...but at least someone tried to tell a different kind of story, one about a society in transition.

I liked it a lot but it is slow at times, but worth seeing for anyone that can tolerate slower paced films, and especially...if you like that genre.  Solid 8/10.  Oh yes, it also is allegorical to our current issues in the country so that added a very interesting layer to it too which you often do not find in a tarrantino film which is sometimes just mindless action...this film meanders plot wise but also has something going on in the background and is like a slower, more thoughtful version of a QT film, and possibly equally good in its own way."" ]"

I just saw \""From Here To Eternity\"" which also takes place on Hawaii with army guys on base and pretty much does the SAME EXACT THING with the subject matter of Hawii as its similar in some of the themes but yet that is considered a classic all time, but people are just complaining because this movie came out now.

Sure the shaky camera can be annoying at times but there is a reason for that, in almost every other cut there is a secret or easter egg, or clue and it can go as far as the inspiration for the film (like the king kong image in the end that you can see if you watch it by frames) or clues for the film itself. The monster was my favorite part of the movie, 'Clover' is an original creature design that is sadly being knocked off in a lot of movies today like in the new 'Godzilla' the Female MUTO moves alot like the monster in this movie and even a few years back with 'Super 8' which was also done by JJ Abrams the monster was really just a smaller version of this one. The acting is not as shabby as a lot of reviewers would let you believe, sure there are scenes of the characters going \""OH MY GOD, ARE YOU SEEING THIS, OH MY GOD!\"" but then again that would probably be my reaction if i saw the statue of liberty's head thrown in the street.
