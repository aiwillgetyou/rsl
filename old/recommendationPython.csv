pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"May 29, 2017","[ ""A big improvement on number 4 and definitely a return to form. The pluses are as expected - Captain Jack, the comedy and the huge range of amazing special effects and CGI. The minuses ,and what I think accounts for the critics low scores, were the new characters..The two  new additions and Javier Bradem's baddie were not super captivating for me..but still OK. All in all a typical fun Pirate movie."", ""If possible see this movie in 3D for the special effects."" ]",3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0
war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul 18, 2017","[ ""The special effects, costume and makeup department really outdid themselves on this movie and deserve Oscars. Woody Harrelson channels Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now. Andy Serkis is wonderful as Caesar. The apes are visually amazing and very sympathetically played.  The rest is variable. You are left in no doubt who you should be cheering for, the apes not the humans. It’s a bit over simplistic with the good bad guy narrative. The story has large plot holes, weak writing. Some crude anti Trump anti America messaging , exceptionally lazy weak writing. A bit over long in the middle, weak editing. Good but not great...."" ]",2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

alien-covenant,10,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"May 23, 2017","[ ""It’s not a 10, more an 8, but the 6.2 has to rectified in some little way. Covenant is superb and deserves to be recognised as such and is being unfairly slighted by reviewers."", ""Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors of all time and the quality shows here. The CGI is magnificent, especially the space shots...Miles ahead of anything else. Its casting is outstanding, everyone fits perfectly, especially Fassbender who might get an award for this one. The Guy Pearce and James Franco cameos are a nice touch too.The crew are not soldiers, why would they be?, and no match for the Xenomorph. Brutal and visceral as you would expect but not gratuitously so...Sure the storyline has a few holes and the gravity issue is a bug bear but it’s still excellent."", ""There are 4 more of these in the pipeline, Awesome Ridley, just Awesome."" ]",18.0,36.0,18.0,18.0
logan-2017,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul  1, 2017","[ ""Hugh Jackman's swansong as the Wolverine in an X Men flick is good, not amazing, just good. Its very hard to critique without spoilers but let us say that it was a good enough movie to end on. It has it's flaws, very slow in the middle and the violence quota is really far too high, being two for example. But overall very satisfying in its realism and its moral narrative. I got a big Mad Max 2/3 vibe from this movie. Deserving of a 7 but only barely."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
allied,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jan  5, 2017","[ ""If you can manage to avoid seeing the trailer or any spoiler in the review section then you are in for a treat with this wartime love/thriller saga. Pitt and Cotillard are magnificent. The production and scenery shots are beautiful, especially in Morocco."", ""Reminiscent of Casablanca, Inglorious Bastards and a touch of Alec Guinness with a poignancy drenched ending which was sad but perfectly fitting. Only real dud note was Max's sister, who was pointlessly shoehorned in, and added nothing."" ]",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
ghost-in-the-shell-2017,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Oct 13, 2017","[ ""A Hollywood take on an Anime based on Manga. Dystopian fantasy Cyberpunk which pays homage to Blade Runner especially, which is no bad thing. It even feels quite like Lucy, a previous Scarlett movie with similar themes. It’s quite chaotic and not everything fits. Some miscasting, (even Scarlett?). Weak dialogues, the great sin of mumbling in a multi-million dollar production, overwrought over complicated story arcs and lacking in anything especially original, the morality and philosophical nature of cybernetics is not well addressed either. Too black and white. All that said, the Cyberpunk feel is excellent and we do get Scarlett in a  spray suit. I’d re watch again and that for me is high praise."" ]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
doctor-strange,9,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Nov 23, 2016","[ ""A great origin story with just the right amount of engaging characters and an easily followed story. Marvel can confusingly over-pack its movies sometimes but not here. Great casting, direction, cinematography and special effects. Everything fits well and Cumberbatch's easy humour is right on note."" ]",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
wonder-woman,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Oct 13, 2017","[ ""I'm giving an 8 for entertainment value as opposed to quality. The technical quality is excellent as you expect but are there a few obvious flaws.The main one being Gil Gadot, She's no Shakespearean actress and for the first bit of the movie is seriously wooden. The plot and dialogue is very one dimensional at the beginning also, school play standard to be honest....but the whole thing really grows on you as it progresses and is extremely entertaining in and of itself. Its an origin story and a morality tale ,  one with holes, but it’s fantasy after all so I wouldn't be too concerned about that. Chris Pine is the best I've seen him, He really is a good actor when given the opportunity.."" ]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
london-has-fallen,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Apr  8, 2016","[ ""London has Fallen doesn't seek to lead the audience up the garden path. It very obviously advertises itself as destructive action with a simple good guy bad guy message, a dollop of patriotism and a little smaltz. Perfect rainy day feel good flick.  Its neither cerebral nor nuanced. But then again neither are the mass of negative reviewers. What did they expect?  Did they watch the trailer ? Who goes to a movie knowing they won't enjoy it ? Whats wrong with some people ?"" ]",3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0
inside-out-2015,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Nov 23, 2017","[ ""Its nowhere as good as either users or critics think it is. In its favour is excellent animation and the brilliant Bing Bong. The journey thru abstract thought was nicely done too. It wants to be a ‘Wizard of Oz’ or at least an ‘Up’, but it just doesn’t have the originality, Every motif you’ll recognise from somewhere else, There is even a copy of the minions. The moral of the story is that sadness and happiness go hand in hand but it really goes overboard on the sadness bit for a while.., small ones will love the colour and bigger ones will be a bit bored."" ]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
ex-machina,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Nov 22, 2017","[ ""Style over substance in Alex Garland's directorial debut. A stage play in essence but with the beautiful Norwegian landscape and an ultra sleek subterranean futuristic research slash eccentric billionaire den as background. The Turing test plot is very familiar and has been done better elsewhere numerous times. This pales in comparison to Blade Runner for example,the yardstick. Even the most recent AI flick I saw 'Morgan' is better. But still it’s compelling and entertaining.....and predictably depressing..Elon Musk would approve."" ]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
inherent-vice,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Nov 24, 2017","[ ""A mish mash of genres with influences plucked from here, there and everywhere. Based on Thomas Pynchon's book ( His signature note is odd character names), this oddity should be very difficult to adapt but PT Anderson manages brilliantly. It’s a weird concoction of Hunter S Thompson, Tarantino, The Big Lebowski, David Lynch, The Rockford Files jumbled up into 70's Cali Pot Noir. An era sadly gone, never to return. The convoluted narrative isn't the point here , more the performances. Phoenix is excellent, Brolin and Waterston too, and the cameo esque back ups are on the button. It grows on you. A slow burner, a day or two after watching you begin to appreciate it."" ]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
big-hero-6,9,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul 16, 2017","[ ""One of the best Disney productions in a long time. Top class animation and a very enjoyable quirkiness. The Japanese/American feel of San Franokyo is brilliant. It plucks at the heartstrings unashamedly but so what? They need to be plucked occasionally. Some might feel the story is cliched but not me, I enjoyed and its moral message of decency, kindness and self sacrifice is one I like."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
the-judge,7,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Feb 11, 2017","[ ""Robert Downey Jr basically does Iron Man the verbal vomiting lawyer and Duvall is the stereotypical ethical  patriarch with a superiority complex. Cliched from beginning to end and criminally under-using top class supporting actors such as Vincent D'Onofrio, Billy Bob Thornton and Vera Farmiga. But despite that it feels good. The prodigal returns to small town America where family values are what matters just hits the right note.."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
how-to-train-your-dragon-2,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Feb 15, 2017","[ ""Not quite as good as the the original but sequels are always tricky, Animation is top drawer, great humor and action, never a dull moment. Number 2 Dragon is more poignant and sad than necessary maybe but I think it's up to the viewers to decide their feelings on that one. It's hard to keep the small ones, the teenagers and the adults happy all at the same time but I think Dreamworks make a good shake at it.."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
calvary,9,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul  3, 2017","[ ""Calvary is a dark tale saved by comedic timing. This is no advertisement for village living either despite the beautiful picturesque Sligo surroundings. Every villager is seriously disturbed or unlikable in one manner or another, including Father James who is having his own existential crisis. The script is beautiful and delivered in typical Irish style,eloquent and articulate yet plain and vulgar all in the same sentence. Dark gallows humour is ever present and necessary. Calvary would fail without it. There is a mystery plot too which is gripping enough. The minuses are characters feel a tad cliched, clerical abuse is a drab subject matter and there is a McGuffin involving the dog which was a bit stupid, Otherwise very well done."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
the-imitation-game,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul 20, 2017","[ ""The historical purists have been up in arms about a host of inaccuracies in the movie but let's not allow  that take away from the movie and especially  the acting performances, which were excellent in such a British way..Cumberbatch was tremendous and played Turing more on the autism spectrum rather than on his sexuality. In fact the grave injustice that befell Turing is very underdone and a weak link. Otherwise the story is very entertaining and enjoyable, A Downton Abbey feel, especially in the location,wardrobe and settings area. Some of the same actors too. Very enjoyable despite the odd quibble."" ]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
john-wick,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Feb  7, 2017","[ ""Keanu Reeves is one of the unsung heroes of the big screen. It's considered cool(and safe) to mock his acting skills but he most definitely knows how to pick pitch perfect roles. And in this stylistic action flick he's awesome. Beautifully choreographed visceral mayhem. Top class production in every detail. The opening 10 minutes is enraging and thankfully John Wick provides satisfying karmic revenge."" ]",1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0
assassins-creed,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jan 30, 2017","[ ""This is a visual beauty. It captures the atmospheric essence of AC the game brilliantly, Beautifully produced, excellent choreography, score, background CGI, attention to detail,the whole lot.The Auto Da Fe scene is exceptionally good. Well cast, no weaknesses here. Fassbender is always good and Jeremy Irons rarely disappoints. It strays from the games on story line and that will annoy some ,but for me, I think they did a great job."", ""Ignore mainstream critics, a silly 34/100 score.

wind-river,8,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Oct  4, 2017","[ ""Jeremy Renner does his best Clint Eastwood in this atmospheric Wyoming thriller/drama. Elisabeth Olsen is excellent as the city gal who comes to appreciate the old style American West , its people and their stoic philosophy regarding the hardships of life.. It is of course a over the top, Wyoming is actually a very nice happy place and the Native American population are by no means lost causes as portrayed here, but still very enjoyable and different to the usual fare. The who dunnit is good, the soundtrack very good and the Wyoming backdrop excellent. Supporting cast is also excellent. Minus points for excessive unnecessary violence and the Wyoming Wildlife Service policy of killing mountain lions and wolves for worrying livestock. Seriously annoyed by that."" ]",2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0
baywatch,10,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Oct 11, 2017","[ ""I'm giving Baywatch a 10 to compensate for the intellectually disabled reviewers who were inexplicably expecting Macbeth at the Globe.
