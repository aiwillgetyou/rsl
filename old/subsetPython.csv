baby-driver,6,Tony1984,/user/Tony1984,"Jul 11, 2017","[ ""If you like car chase movies with Tarantino levels of violence and snappy chit chat with top class actors, then this is the movie for you, except the for lead actor that is.. Ansel Elsgort is awful, way out of his depth with no screen presence at all, zilch zero nada. In fairness the writers were mawkishly nauseating in establishing his character's virtue ?Dead Mom, Savantesque, Loves Old Music, Looks after Black disabled Step father, Kind to old ladies, Self Sacrificial....where's the sick bag ?which doesn't help. Regardless he's abysmal and he ,with the capable assistance of a jarring music director with no sense of tone or timing , ruin it for everybody and we get a 6 at best.....8.5? Get outta here shills"" ]",4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0
baby-driver,6,DefinitelyMayb,/user/DefinitelyMayb,"Aug 18, 2017","[ ""I seriously don't get all the hype about this film. Sure I love Edgar Wright's direction in Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead and with Scott Pilgrim, but this movie is substandard at best as a comedy heist film. First, it does neither of its genre elements particularly well - I wasn't laughing nor particularly thrilled for most parts. The plot is very generic and lacks any sense of urgency for the most part. Character motivations are all over the place like Edgar Wright's hair and editing-wise, wasn't anything special. People seem to harp on about how great the action is and how its well timed to the songs, but I don't see anything great about it to be honest. Perhaps why I didnt like this film is that I've seen it before. That was a masterpiece called Drive and Baby Driver seems to borrow everything about it. The good things about Baby Driver is that it is midly entertaining and some of the songs are okay, I guess, apart from the fact its blasting at the audicence 24/7 like an angsty teen's mixtape."" ]",4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0
